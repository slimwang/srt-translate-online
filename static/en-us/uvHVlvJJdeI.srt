1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:02,890
All right. Let's make things a bit more interesting.

2
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:05,220
Same page as before, but now with an external

3
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:08,140
CSS file. This time around we get the HTML

4
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:12,110
response and start building DOM. We then discover the

5
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:16,840
link tag and send the request for the CSS.

6
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:19,980
In the meantime, we continue parsing the HTML and

7
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:22,930
constructing the DOM, but note that we can't render

8
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:25,800
the page just yet because we're still blocked and waiting

9
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,630
for the CSS. Once the CSS does arrive and we

10
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:33,620
finish building the CCS Object Model, we can paint the page.

11
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:34,410
>> Gotcha.

12
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:36,940
>> Now, I want you to figure out the critical path metrics.
