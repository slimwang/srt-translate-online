1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,106
Try out your updated app
if you haven't already.

2
00:00:08,132 --> 00:00:12,440
You'll need to wait a while for the data
to show up in the Analytics dashboard.

3
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:18,450
But don't forget, you can always check
the logs to see if the hits got sent,

4
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:21,140
if your phone or
tablet is connected to Android Studio.

5
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:24,484
In the Analytics dashboard,

6
00:00:24,484 --> 00:00:31,090
go to Conversions > Ecommerce >
Shopping Analysis > Shopping Behavior.

7
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:35,005
And make sure the date range
is set as you want it to be.

8
00:00:35,005 --> 00:00:39,044
So, now we see that some of
the sessions include Check-Out,

9
00:00:39,044 --> 00:00:42,170
let's confirm in
the Checkout Behavior page.

10
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:42,959
Drum roll please.

11
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:47,245
And we see that we had some sessions
with step one of Check-Out.

12
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:52,490
Step one implies maybe there's a step
two and actually there can be, and

13
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:55,790
I'm going to talk more
about Check-Out steps soon.

14
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:59,470
Also notice there are no transactions,
and

15
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:04,550
that's because a transaction
involves money changing hands.

16
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:05,980
Or more technically speaking,

17
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:11,980
a transaction requires a product
action to be action_purchase,

18
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:15,680
or action_refund.

19
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,250
We'll be getting to transactions next.
