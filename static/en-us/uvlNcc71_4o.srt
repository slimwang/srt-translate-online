00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,496
We know for a standard form the slope is negative A over B, so our slope is

2
00:00:04,496 --> 00:00:09,233
negative 3 halves. If we want a line that's parallel to this line, well, our

3
00:00:09,233 --> 00:00:14,020
slopes have to be the same, so this also has to be negative 3 halves. Way to go

4
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:15,488
if you got those right.
