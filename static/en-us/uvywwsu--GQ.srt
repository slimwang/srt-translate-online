1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:04,380
The correct answer as to whether you
need to create any additional variables

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:05,870
is, well, no.

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:10,910
You have a variable keeping
track of Team A's score.

4
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:13,750
These two buttons are simply
going to affect the value

5
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:17,670
that's stored in that score, and there's
no other variables that are needed.

6
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:19,080
Alright, let's see what
this looks like in code.

7
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:23,360
We can actually model this pretty
closely from off of what we did for

8
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:25,250
addThreeForTeamA.

9
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:26,690
Whoops.
I see a little error.

10
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:27,520
Let's add a space here.

11
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:30,760
Sorry, where was I?

12
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:35,130
Yes, we can do the same thing for
one and two as we did for three.

13
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:36,520
In fact, I don't like typing.

14
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:37,960
I'm going to just go ahead and
copy this.

15
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:43,870
And I'll paste it here,
in the addTwoForTeamA and

16
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:45,490
here in the addOneForTeamA.

17
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:48,370
Okay.

18
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:54,250
So now for example, in addTwoForTeamA,
it's adding three to the score and

19
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:55,630
then displaying the score.

20
00:00:55,630 --> 00:01:00,460
But I don't want it to add three,
I want it to add two.

21
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:05,099
And here, in addOneForTeamA
It's adding 3 to the score, but

22
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:06,920
I actually just wanted to add 1.

23
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:09,790
But in both cases,
I still wanted to display the score.

24
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:12,930
I'm just changing it by a little
bit of a different number.

25
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:14,180
Let's run this to see if it works.

26
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,369
Okay, moment of truth.

27
00:01:25,682 --> 00:01:27,190
Okay, looks like it's working.
