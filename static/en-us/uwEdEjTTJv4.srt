Function A, f of x equals x minus 2 times x minus 1, has two linear factors,

2
00:00:04,623 --> 00:00:09,551
which we can see right here, two zeros, which we see with these 2 x intercepts,

3
00:00:09,551 --> 00:00:17,818
and is degree 2. Interesting. Function B, which is f of x equals x minus 2

4
00:00:17,818 --> 00:00:23,880
times x minus 1 times x plus 3, has three linear factors, three zeros, and is

5
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:29,112
degree 3. Now, please note that, even though I pointed out the x intercepts on

6
00:00:29,112 --> 00:00:32,375
these graphs when we talked about zeroes, if the zeroes were non real, then we

7
00:00:32,375 --> 00:00:37,803
wouldn't see them as x intercepts. But they would still be roots.
