00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,800
Okay, now that you know some
differences between fundamental and

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:08,590
technical factors, I want you to look
at each one of these four factors and

3
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:12,890
fill in the box, T for
technical or F for fundamental.

4
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:15,080
So, for
each one decide wether its technical or

5
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:16,870
fundamental and fill in the box.
