00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,880
Let's add product flavors
to our joke telling app.

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:05,190
The free version will tell a bad joke,
and

3
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:08,830
the paid version will tell a funny joke,
at least that's the intention.

4
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:11,310
We've provided some sample
jokes in the course code,

5
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:13,340
but feel free to get creative.

6
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:16,640
When you're done, where do you
put string resources for free and

7
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,120
paid flavors.

8
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,270
Fill in this portion of the path.
