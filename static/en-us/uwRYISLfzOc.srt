00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,719
So now, we're going to get a little bit more practical.

2
00:00:03,719 --> 00:00:06,540
You will get to see that, if I take an image of Tigger here and

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:10,370
Einstein, my two friends that you've seen through some of my lecture now, and

4
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:14,240
if somebody gave me two images of this, how would I blend them together?

5
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,510
So in this lecture, I'm going to basically take what we have learned so far, and

6
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:22,660
introduce the concept of Gaussian pyramids, that will be then used to figure

7
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:27,030
out, how we can merge the images of these two characters, but at the same time,

8
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:31,270
maintain the frequency information of both those images correctly.

9
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:34,530
So we can do the blending, at the right frequency spectra.
