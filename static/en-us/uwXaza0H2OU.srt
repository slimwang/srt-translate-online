1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Now let's write a function to solve the missionary and cannibals problem.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
It takes a start state.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Here's the normal problem: 3 missionary, 3 cannibals, and 1 boat on the start side.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Nothing on the other side, and it takes a goal state.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
The goal state is not specified. It's just the opposite of that--3, 3, 1 on the other side.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Nothing on the original side.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
The state is this 6-tuple, and we're trying to find a path from the initial state to the goal state.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
In fact, we're trying to find the path with the least number of steps.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm not going to ask you to do this as a quiz.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
If you're enthusiastic, you can stop the video now

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
and go ahead and solve it on your own, but now I'm going to go ahead and show it to you.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Here's a solution that looks pretty much like the pouring water problem.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
We check to see if the goal is None, then we fix up a nice goal.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
We check to see if we've accidentally already reached the goal at the start.

15
00:00:52,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Then we just search for the shortest path.
