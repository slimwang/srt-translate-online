1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
And here we go, we already know 95% is 1.96.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
We know as you want to increase our confidence,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
we have to go outbound which means a larger value.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
So it's 2.58 as the only choice for larger value,

5
00:00:13,000 --> 99:59:59,999
then it's 1.64 the final choice for the 90% confidence interval.
