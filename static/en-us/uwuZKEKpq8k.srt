In addition to AI problems having several characteristics,

2
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:09,740
AI agents too have several properties. Property number one. AI agents,

3
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:13,170
have only a limited computing power, processing speed, memory size, and

4
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:17,890
so on. Property number two. AI agents have limited sensors,

5
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:22,060
they cannot perceive everything in the world. Property number three.

6
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:26,220
AI agents have limited attention, they cannot focus on everything at the same

7
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:31,100
time. Property number four. Computational logic is fundamentally deductive.

8
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:37,090
Property number five. The world is large, but AI agents' knowledge of the world

9
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:42,150
is incomplete relative to the world. So, the question then becomes, how can AI

10
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:46,800
agents with such bounded rationality address open-ended problems in the world?
