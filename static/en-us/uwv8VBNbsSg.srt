1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:03,650
Let's look at a very simple
one-dimensional example.

2
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:07,660
Now that's not very exciting but
we've got our our one-dimension stage so

3
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:10,690
x is where is this
thing along some line.

4
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:13,310
I may have state that says where it is,

5
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:16,400
I might also have state
about how fast it's moving.

6
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:20,790
So here, what I'm showing you is
a state vector that's both position and

7
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:22,070
velocity.

8
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:28,005
So, here, our state vector x is,
I'm using p for position instead of x,

9
00:00:28,005 --> 00:00:30,500
'because otherwise those x's
would get too confusing.

10
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:31,920
So, we have p and v.

11
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:32,960
What's v?

12
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,010
Velocity.

13
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:34,860
All right?

14
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:40,090
Now, going way back to, physics that
you took in either 12th grade or

15
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:42,800
10th grade, 8th grade, or
if you're really smart, 3rd grade.

16
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,090
You'd learn some very simple,
updated equations, right?

17
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:50,400
That basically your belief about where
the point would be at some time,

18
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:53,820
t would be wherever it was at t minus 1.

19
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:58,240
Plus delta t times
whatever the velocity was.

20
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,810
All right?
That's just simple integration by

21
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:01,670
velocity.

22
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:04,099
And then you'll notice there
this little element here.

23
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:05,950
That epsilon, that's noise.

24
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:08,810
That says, oh, there's some
noise that's been added, right?

25
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:11,330
So maybe things aren't exactly perfect.

26
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:15,700
Further more, I'm assuming
that my velocity is constant,

27
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:18,180
except that some noise
gets added to that.

28
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:22,810
That is, I might speed up or slow down a
little bit, but it's totally random, so

29
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:26,160
I don't know anything about it, and
so that's also going to be noise.

30
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:30,985
Now, I can write these same set of
equations in a very simple matrix form,

31
00:01:30,985 --> 00:01:32,170
okay?

32
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:37,100
And here it is,
that x at time t is dx plus noise.

33
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:39,210
And here is this matrix, right?

34
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:42,280
This is that matrix one delta t 0 1.

35
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:46,990
Which times the state vector,
there's our state vector there.

36
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:50,680
Plus noise, gives us what your
next state vector will be.

37
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:53,980
So this is a linear dynamics model.

38
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:58,240
We're using position and
velocity as your state.

39
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,240
Now what are we going to measure?

40
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:02,340
Well, maybe we can only
measure the position.

41
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:06,990
So even though my state that I'm trying
to estimate is position and velocity.

42
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:08,639
Maybe I only measure the position.

43
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:11,790
I've got a little radar thing
that pings out and says, oh,

44
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:14,470
okay, I think this thing
is about 2.4 meters away.

45
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:15,250
All right?

46
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:20,440
So, that would be just a matrix
of 1 0 that multiplies the state,

47
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:24,100
cause all it does is it pulls out the,
the position.

48
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:25,770
And again there's noise.

49
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:27,330
Because there's noise in my measurement.

50
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:28,880
Here's my m matrix, so

51
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:33,140
this is the same linear model
that I have for measurements.

52
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:36,100
So I have a linear dynamics model,
and I have a linear measurement model.
