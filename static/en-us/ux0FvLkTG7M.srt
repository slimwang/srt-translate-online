1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:03,480
Here's another opportunity for
you to practice.

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:06,960
This calendar is really
doing things the hard way.

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,600
Each part of the date is being typed
in individually, as is the time.

4
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:15,115
So for this quiz,
I want you to simplify this calendar.

5
00:00:15,115 --> 00:00:19,125
Consolidate all of these
inputs into a single input

6
00:00:19,125 --> 00:00:23,355
that still lets users input
all the same information.

7
00:00:23,355 --> 00:00:24,095
And as always,

8
00:00:24,095 --> 00:00:26,605
take a look at the instructor notes
if you want some more information.
