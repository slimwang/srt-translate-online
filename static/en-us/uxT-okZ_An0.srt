The Clinical Information Modeling

00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:10,380
is an attempt to enumerate the detailed
models of hundreds of thousands of

00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:14,690
medical ideas to achieve

00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:17,532
They can be used to define
standard messages or

00:00:17,532 --> 00:00:21,750
structured documents as

00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:26,158
to automate or facilitate constructing
data entry or reporting templates.

00:00:26,158 --> 00:00:30,040
The CIMI group lists
simplification of existing models,

00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:33,450
perhaps referring to RIM,
as one of its key objectives.
