1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
And the answer is, over here.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:08,000
These 4 data points are associated with C1, so we can safely ignore all the other ones.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
This one over here would be at the center of the 3 data points over here,

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
but this one pulls back this data point drastically towards it.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
This is about the best trade-off between these 3 points over here that all have a string

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
attached and pull in this direction, compared to this point over here.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Any of the other ones don't even lie between those points,

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
and therefore won't be good cluster centers.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 99:59:59,999
The one over here is way too far to the right.
