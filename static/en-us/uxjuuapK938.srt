00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,140
Now recall from a previous lesson where we actually looked at

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:07,950
the whole concept of how we can differentiate an image in x and y, and

3
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:14,690
use that to be able to compute, for example, a derivative of an image in x,

4
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:19,560
which is basically looking at how the columns, when I parse through this,

5
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,440
can give me highlights, or where the maximal change is, and

6
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:27,910
in this it detects, for example, the edges here in this rectangle, and

7
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:32,670
of course, I could do the same, going row-wise in this instance, and we're

8
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:37,970
going columns in this one, and we can use that now look for maximum change,

9
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:42,400
this one then from black to white, and in this one, of course, white to black.

10
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:46,180
This shows you very nicely where the edges, or at least with

11
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:50,570
of gradient change is that we can actually use to compute things like edges.

12
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:54,630
This was also showcasing a much nicer example, of looking at how we can do with

13
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:59,340
the zebra, and here you can notice that you see, basically, information on how

14
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:04,480
the gradients that is how rapid the change is as I traverse in this direction,

15
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:09,070
and, also, if I traverse in this direction, so, in the columns and

16
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:10,700
in the rows, x and y.

17
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:15,180
Basic concept that we now want to build on to be able to do much more with.
