00:00:01,142 --> 00:00:05,180
All right, so by now you should
have a fairly decent sized list

2
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:08,189
of apps that you might be
interested in pursuing.

3
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:10,970
See if you can whittle that down
to about three that you would be

4
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:13,160
super excited to work on.

5
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:17,350
And, once you've done that, it's
time to get feedback on these ideas.

6
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:21,380
One of the most important parts of iOS
app development is to get feedback

7
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:23,030
early and often.

8
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:24,390
So lets do that.

9
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:26,990
Go ahead and
post your three app ideas to the forum

10
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:30,290
along with descriptions on
what you want them to do.

11
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:33,430
While you're there, respond to
two of your classmates posts and

12
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:34,970
give them feedback.

13
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:36,340
And then, while you're waiting for

14
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:40,280
feedback, share your app ideas
with your friends and family.

15
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:41,490
What do they think?

16
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:42,610
Now go forth.

17
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:43,970
Give feedback.

18
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:44,650
I mean it.

19
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:45,510
Shoo.
Get out of here.

20
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:47,350
Get out of class.

21
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:48,160
Go talk to people.

22
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,430
See what they think.

23
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:52,000
It'll really help you decide what
you want to pursue in the end.
