00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
[Thrun] So let me ask you about dependence.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Suppose we flip 2 coins.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Our first coin is a fair coin, and we're going to denote the outcome by X1.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
So the chance of X1 coming up heads is half.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
But now we branch into picking a coin based on the first outcome.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
So if the first outcome was heads,

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
you pick a coin whose probability of coming up heads is going to be 0.9.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The way I word this is by conditional probability,

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
probability of the second coin flip coming up heads

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
provided that or given that X1, the first coin flip, was heads, is 0.9.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
The first coin flip might also come up tails,

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
in which case I pick a very different coin.

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:54,000
In this case I pick a coin which with 0.8 probability will once again give me tails,

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
conditioned on the first coin flip coming up tails.

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
So my question for you is,

16
00:00:59,000 --> 99:59:59,999
what's the probability of the second coin flip coming up heads?
