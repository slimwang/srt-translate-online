00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:04,470
The fifth major category of issues is heterogeneity.

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:08,020
We started with the assumption, we have a heterogeneous distributed system,

3
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:13,870
but the dimensions of heterogeneity are many. Hardware, this

4
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:18,880
not just what kind of computers, but also are there embedded devices involved.

5
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,890
Are there cellphones involved in this? Are there card readers involved?

6
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:27,600
Are there other, other devices? Different operating systems.

7
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:32,775
Different programming languages. All of the different standards protocols and

8
00:00:32,775 --> 00:00:37,510
API's that might be involved in building this application. The pieces of

9
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:42,620
the application that provide access such as a web browsers or these devices.

10
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:48,670
All of these can change. More over even if they don't change.

11
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:54,075
Even if they're uniformly applied. That is every part of the system uses

12
00:00:54,075 --> 00:00:58,460
Linux or every part of the system uses Ruby. Are they using the same version?

13
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:04,330
For example, imagine the issue of testing a web

14
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:08,810
based application across browser versions. You have three or

15
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:14,960
four main families of browsers, each coming in three or four different versions.

16
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:19,080
Also the problem of testing becomes that much more challenging.
