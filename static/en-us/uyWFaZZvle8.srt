00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:01,250
Welcome back to Computer Vision.

2
00:00:01,250 --> 00:00:04,620
We're going to continue our
conversation on segmentation.

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:05,510
Last time we,

4
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:09,910
we introduced it as segmentation
as a clustering in feature space.

5
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:12,250
And feature space could include
things like position, so

6
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:16,210
you might get nice segments that
are localized, within an image.

7
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:20,110
This time we're going to look at, some
better algorithms than say, k-means.

8
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:22,430
And then also some better,
or I should say,

9
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:26,300
some more extended feature spaces which
allow us to do better segmentation.
