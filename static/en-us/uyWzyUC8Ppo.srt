1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:01,960
Great.
So you've actually finished step one.

2
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:07,460
Now that we have these two TextViews and
this ImageView, we should decide

3
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:10,850
roughly how we're going to get them
to the correct place on the screen.

4
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:13,420
All right, so
on to step two, positioning.

5
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:17,630
When you're thinking about positioning,
the first question you should always ask

6
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:20,190
yourself is what
View Group you should use.

7
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:22,890
Speaking of which,
what View Group should you use?

8
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:28,300
You only know about two of them,
so which is it, Linear Layout or

9
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:29,040
Relative Layout?

10
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:33,210
Also, go ahead and
back your opinion up with facts.

11
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:35,070
Tell me why your choice
is the best choice.
