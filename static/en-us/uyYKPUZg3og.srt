1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,260
Let's look at projective transformation.

2
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:07,280
In a projective transformation, what we
are interested in is taking an image and

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:09,290
warping it in this manner.

4
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:12,940
So basically,
a projective transformation is

5
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:15,870
a combination of an affine
transformation we've looked at, but

6
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:18,680
added to that, a projective warp.

7
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:21,900
Properties of that form
of transformation is.

8
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:24,890
The origin does not again
necessarily map to the origin.

9
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:26,970
You can see that this
could've transformed or

10
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:28,590
move translated over to this point.

11
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:32,800
But the line are still straight lines,
right?

12
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,060
Lines map to straight lines here.

13
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:39,060
But now parallel lines do not
necessarily remain parallel.

14
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:41,310
An example of this you may actually see.

15
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:45,590
That for example, if t and h,
if they were parallel here,

16
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:50,240
they're no longer parallel if I was
to draw an h here and a t here.

17
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,450
Let's just do that.

18
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:54,016
And they would actually
intersect somewhere.

19
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:59,500
While t and h, unlikely to intersect.

20
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:02,630
And of course ratios are not
preserved in this one either.

21
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:04,019
Here, of course, we have.

22
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:05,190
What do you think?

23
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:06,270
Nine parameters?

24
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:07,440
Nah.
Remember,

25
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,810
I always said this
will convert back to 1.

26
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:12,670
So in essence, we have 8 parameters.

27
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:14,900
Which basically means we
have 8 degree of freedom.
