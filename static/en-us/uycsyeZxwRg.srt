1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:03,710
Starting at the first part of the quiz,
it needed a maximum.

2
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:07,710
So I added a max of 100,
that's easy enough.

3
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:11,840
The second one needed a minimum,
so I added a minimum of 0.

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:16,860
The third one needed both a minimum and
a maximum, so I added a minimum of 0 and

5
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:20,910
a maximum of 100, not too bad.

6
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:24,330
And the last one, the fourth part of
the quiz, needed a minimum, maximum and

7
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:27,980
a step so I added a minimum,
maximum and a step of 10 so

8
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:31,570
that the controls would jump up or
down by 10 each time.

9
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:35,230
And here's the input for
the bonus question.

10
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:38,930
In the bonus question, I challenged
you to add a pattern attribute with

11
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:43,010
a regular expression to validate
the letter grade going into the input.

12
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:48,430
Here's the one that I used which
looked for either an A or A+.

13
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:51,380
Or anything between a B and
D with a plus or

14
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:54,730
minus after it if it needed it,
or just an F.

15
00:00:56,090 --> 00:01:00,100
Your regex may or may not have looked
different and that's totally fine.

16
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:02,900
Different school systems use
different grading systems so

17
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:03,910
use whatever works for you.

18
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:06,862
And here,
let me show you the form in action.

19
00:01:06,862 --> 00:01:10,660
All right, it looks good,
each input is going up by 10,

20
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:13,360
it looks like, all the way up to 100.

21
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,560
Yep, won't go down all the way to 100.

22
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,440
All the way to 100, and won't go down.

23
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:21,170
And when I hit Calculate,
I still see an average.

24
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:22,770
And let me check this pattern attribute.

25
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:24,500
Let me see if this works.

26
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:27,780
I'm going to add a grade of M,
which is not a real grade.

27
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:30,340
So this should fail,
and let me hit Submit.

28
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:31,900
Oh, look at that.

29
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:33,900
This field needs to be filled out.

30
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:36,830
And that's because the required
attribute was on it.

31
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:39,360
So I filled that out, and
let me hit Submit again.

32
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,720
And now look,
I'm getting an error here that asks for

33
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:44,800
the requested format for this grade.

34
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,490
So clearly an M doesn't work.

35
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:47,670
Let me try an A.

36
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:49,340
Hey, look at that.

37
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:51,070
The form was submitted.

38
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:54,200
I really hope you're starting to see
just how useful these validation

39
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,250
attributes are.

40
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:59,120
They provide a fantastic first pass at
making sure the data that's going into

41
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,340
your forms is accurate.
