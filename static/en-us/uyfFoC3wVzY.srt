1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:05,380
The first part of security planning is
to start doing inventory of our assets.

2
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:08,500
What is that we have which is of value?

3
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:14,270
And something that is of value of
course, has to have some risk to it.

4
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:16,239
So there has to be a threat.

5
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:20,890
That is the source of that risk that
is faced by this particular asset.

6
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:22,730
So the service is the software,

7
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:26,230
the hardware,
these are the assets that we have.

8
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:29,390
And we have to concern
ourselves about securing them.

9
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:33,370
So, when you think about cyber security
and planning for it, of course,

10
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:36,550
you have to worry about
all these assets,

11
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:40,280
or the list of what needs to be
secured has to include all these.

12
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:43,610
When you talk about the software,
so this is sort of the hardware.

13
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:47,998
When it comes to software, we're running
operating systems on these servers,

14
00:00:47,998 --> 00:00:50,730
or laptops, or mobile devices.

15
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:54,870
The databases that store large amounts
of data, perhaps, the services that

16
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:58,890
are talking about the applications
actually we have on the devices.

17
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:03,420
Again when it comes to software and
services we have to worry about that.

18
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:07,660
And of course the databases or
the file systems,

19
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:11,790
they're storing lots of data,
either structured data or in files.

20
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:13,780
Some of the data is
going to be sensitive.

21
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:15,750
Some of it could be highly sensitive.

22
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:19,730
Could be your Lexile property,
you could in employed accords and

23
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:24,240
things like that, so of course we
have to say where this data resides.

24
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,570
What kind database, which server,
and are we securing the server,

25
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:31,420
the database, and
the data that's stored in it.

26
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:37,490
And whenever you talk about assets and
securing them, securing them from whom?

27
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:41,376
Are we concerned about
external attackers or hackers?

28
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:43,543
They could be cyber criminals.

29
00:01:43,543 --> 00:01:45,930
They could be motivated for
some other reason.

30
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:50,995
Activists, for example,
activists perhaps don't like you or

31
00:01:50,995 --> 00:01:52,375
your business or whatever it is.

32
00:01:52,375 --> 00:01:55,255
So is it remote hackers that concern us,

33
00:01:55,255 --> 00:01:58,955
when it comes to securing all these
assets that we are talking about?

34
00:01:58,955 --> 00:02:02,155
Or it's insiders,
it's employees within the organization
