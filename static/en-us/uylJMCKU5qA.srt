00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:04,200
This next demo will characterize
the effect of choosing to augment by

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:05,171
a shortest path.

3
00:00:05,171 --> 00:00:10,964
We'll let M be a matching and we'll let
P be a shortest augmenting path for

4
00:00:10,964 --> 00:00:16,024
M and then we'll let Q be an augmenting
path for M augmented by P.

5
00:00:16,024 --> 00:00:21,113
Well, then the size of Q is at
least the size of P plus twice

6
00:00:21,113 --> 00:00:26,324
the overlap between P and
Q in terms of the number of edges.

7
00:00:26,324 --> 00:00:31,731
For the proof, we first observe
that the size M augmented by P and

8
00:00:31,731 --> 00:00:37,654
augmented by Q minus the size of
the original matching M is equal to 2.

9
00:00:37,654 --> 00:00:42,036
So the symmetric difference
between the augmented version and

10
00:00:42,036 --> 00:00:47,326
the original, which is also equal to
the symmetric difference between P and

11
00:00:47,326 --> 00:00:52,549
Q must contain two vertex-disjoint
augmenting paths of length at most P.

12
00:00:52,549 --> 00:00:54,151
They couldn't be shorter than P.

13
00:00:54,151 --> 00:00:56,760
Otherwise, P wouldn't
be as short as path.

14
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:01,650
Therefore, the total number of edges in
the symmetric difference between P and

15
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:04,120
Q is at least twice the size of P.

16
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:10,090
Now the size of Q plus the size
of P is the size of what is in

17
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:14,340
exactly one of the two plus twice
the size of what is in both.

18
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,470
You can think about the overlap
being counted once in P and

19
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:23,540
once in Q, but
not at all in the symmetric difference.

20
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:26,740
Well then, applying our bound on
the size of the symmetric difference

21
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:28,500
between P and Q.

22
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,235
We then have that this is at most,

23
00:01:31,235 --> 00:01:35,532
twice the size of P + 2 times
the overlap of P and Q and

24
00:01:35,532 --> 00:01:41,033
subtracting off the size of P from
both sides gives us the theorem.

25
00:01:41,033 --> 00:01:45,710
A corollary of this lemma is that
if P and Q are the same size,

26
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:48,718
then they have to be vertex disjoint.

27
00:01:48,718 --> 00:01:51,759
The fact that they are edge
disjoint follows directly from

28
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:55,048
this equation to argue that they
have to be vertex-disjoint,

29
00:01:55,048 --> 00:01:59,140
we'll argue that sharing
a vertex implies sharing an edge.

30
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:04,250
So let's take this theorem and suppose
not, we'll let v be a shared vertex.

31
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:09,508
Well then, v has to be matched
in M augmented by P, so

32
00:02:09,508 --> 00:02:12,800
Q must share the matched edge with P.

33
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:18,060
We can visualize this argument by
drawing P with the original matching M.

34
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:22,120
Then once we've augmented,
P becomes like so.

35
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:26,760
And regardless of what vertex
the path Q happened to share with it,

36
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:30,260
that vertex is now matched and
augmented by P.

37
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:37,240
So Q has to follow that edge, but
then Q and P share an edge and

38
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:44,460
Q is greater than P by at least two and
that then leads to a contradiction.
