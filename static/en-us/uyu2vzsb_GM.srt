1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:02,620
So we just finished lesson zero, which

2
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:05,500
was an introduction. In this lesson, lesson one,

3
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:07,870
we will build two main projects while

4
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:10,420
using functions. Now, towards the end of this

5
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:12,920
lesson we will present a scenario where

6
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:16,400
functions won't quite present a very eloquent solution.

7
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:21,190
That will pave the way for us to learn new stuff in lesson two and three.

8
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:22,700
>> Now if you feel extremely

9
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:25,600
comfortable with functions and understand their limitations

10
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,460
completely you should consider moving on to the next lesson, however

11
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:31,860
if you feel like you want to learn more about functions

12
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:35,420
in the Python programming language, continue to take this lesson, watch

13
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:38,140
the next video, we will use it to write our first program.
