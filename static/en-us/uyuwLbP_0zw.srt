Okay. My answer looks something like this.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I had to import minidom so we could use that,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
and then we used a parse string for minidom,

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
which is what we used previously in lecture to parse the XML that were passed in in this parameter.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Then I used getElementsByTagName GML coordinates.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Sometimes if the XML is more complex, you can't just cheat

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
and find the one tag name that you're looking for,

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
but in this case we know there's only going to be one coordinates element

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
in a valid response, so we can just see if there's any element in here that has this tag name.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
If we have that element, this should return True.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
We're actually kind of going out on a limb here.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
If this wasn't such a simple document, such a simple protocol,

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I'd probably have to check to see are there childnodes?

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Do those childnodes have values? That sort of thing.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I haven't done any testing that would suggest that. Just assuming it's all there it doesn't work.

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:54,000
What I do is if it's all there, we call a split, which splits on the comma to get the two parts--

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
the longitude and the latitude--and then we reverse them and return with latitude and longitude.

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
If we print our response, this is what we get.

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Now if I were to change our XML a little bit--let's say we just get rid of the actual coordinate

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
from the sample XML I passed in--and run this, we get None as our answer.

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
That should work for now. Good job if you got that, and let's add this to our program.
