1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The answer is 83.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
If you remember this method, you realize there were four quartiles,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
and individual elements separate those.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
This one's called the median, the lower, and the upper quartile,

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
and these guys are the ones being picked.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Now, 163 - 3 special elements makes 160, divided by 4, makes each of these 40.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 99:59:59,999
We pick the two center 40s, plus these three special elements and get 83.
