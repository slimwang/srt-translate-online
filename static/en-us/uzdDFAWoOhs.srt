00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,608
Now we'd like you to write this flip book animation style in code. We've given

2
00:00:03,624 --> 00:00:09,419
you a list of image assets to use for "Evil Devices". What you need to do is load

3
00:00:09,419 --> 00:00:13,777
all of these image assets and place them in the frame array. After your images

4
00:00:13,777 --> 00:00:16,643
are loaded, you should go through and fill out the rest of the animation

5
00:00:16,643 --> 00:00:20,538
function here, which will actually draw the flip book animation images to the

6
00:00:20,538 --> 00:00:23,909
screen as we described before. Make sure that when your animation is finished

7
00:00:23,909 --> 00:00:27,216
you loop back to the beginning. Now before this you need to have some logic

8
00:00:27,228 --> 00:00:31,086
that checks for whether or not the images are loaded, and once all of the frames

9
00:00:31,098 --> 00:00:34,931
have been loaded, actually does a call to setInterval. Now setInterval takes

10
00:00:34,943 --> 00:00:39,471
as input a pointer to a function you'd like to call as well as a millisecond

11
00:00:39,471 --> 00:00:42,984
count on how often you want it to be called. So, for instance, if I made a

12
00:00:42,984 --> 00:00:46,819
function and wanted it to be called once every 30 milliseconds, those would be

13
00:00:46,819 --> 00:00:50,255
parameters that I pass into it. Make sure that your setInterval call, actually

14
00:00:50,267 --> 00:00:53,159
calls the animate function, once every 30 milliseconds.
