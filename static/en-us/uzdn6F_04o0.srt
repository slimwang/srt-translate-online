1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:05,000
Finally, one last thing to show you just sort of in completeness.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,800
So, you remember one dimensional case of the second derivative of the Gaussian.

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:13,500
So, what we have here is, this was our original Gaussian.

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:18,070
This second derivative was this inverted Mexican hat operator, and

5
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:20,620
when we applied that to f.

6
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:23,920
It's the same thing as taking the second derivative of the smoothed version.

7
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:28,480
We were looking for that spot there and those what are called zero-crossings

8
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:33,680
that, on that bottom graph, that corresponded to where the edges were, okay?

9
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:34,940
But to do this in two,

10
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:39,010
in two dimension is a little bit harder, and the reason is.

11
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:41,170
There's more than one direction to take our derivative.

12
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:43,890
So here we have our Gaussian, the formula there, and it,

13
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:46,220
you know, is this nice mountain in the middle.

14
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:49,780
But we have to take a derivative in one direction, and so,

15
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:53,240
you know, that's the one that's saying x, and there'd by one and Y.

16
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,500
And then on our second derivatives there'd be three choices.

17
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,970
I could take the partial of x again, so

18
00:00:57,970 --> 00:01:02,400
that's a partial of f squared is partial of x twice.

19
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,500
I can do the partial of y, twice.

20
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,020
I can also do the partial of f with respect to y.

21
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:09,360
Which one am I supposed to use?

22
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,540
Well, the correct answer is,

23
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:15,179
you use what's referred to as a Laplacian of Gaussian.

24
00:01:15,179 --> 00:01:20,900
The Laplacian operator, shown here, is this second derivative of x of

25
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:26,400
f with respect to x squared plus the secondary of f with respect to y squared.

26
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,940
And that's what actually gives you this Mexican hat operator symmetrically.

27
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:34,590
And if you apply that to the image and

28
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:39,970
you take the 0 crossings, you will get your edges.

29
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:45,190
And in fact, if you run the some demonstration code in matlab for edges.

30
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:49,780
You can take Canny edges, or you can take difference of Gaussians or

31
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:52,230
Laplacian of Gaussians, they're, they're almost identical.

32
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:54,060
And you can see, what that does is it's looking for

33
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:58,490
the 0 crossings and it's another way of getting the edges.

34
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:01,680
One of the challenges there is those tend to be closed counters all

35
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,810
the time whereas the Canny will only find you the,

36
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:06,970
the contours that have some magnitude support.

37
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:10,110
I would tell you most people, more people probably use canny for

38
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:11,480
just doing regular edge detection.
