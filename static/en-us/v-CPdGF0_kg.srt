2
00:00:08,799 --> 00:00:12,015
Often, what we're encountering,
the pain that we're discussing,

3
00:00:12,015 --> 00:00:15,790
the frustration that we have,
is actually the result of past success.

4
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:20,530
We probably have to keep in mind
Moore's Law and other laws that apply to

5
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:25,340
the improvements that have happened
in tact, so things move very quickly.

6
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:28,570
I talked about this in
a couple of context,

7
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:32,110
but Ken Schreiber is one
of the agile signatories.

8
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:37,200
He talks about three sources of
variation in software development.

9
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,850
So one of them is infrastructure,
it's changing all the time.

10
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:43,770
The other is requirements,
there is always new and

11
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:45,490
different things that we can do.

12
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:48,370
And the third is people,
people working individually and

13
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:50,370
people working together as teams.

14
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:55,090
And I think in this regard,
you find yourself in an organization,

15
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:58,030
you see that things are frustrating,
and I think, or

16
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:02,650
that they're not perfect, and I think
you have to take the perspective,

17
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:07,750
with this sword, right [LAUGH], with
these people, I will solve this problem.

18
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:13,040
Otherwise, it becomes like
blame focused, right?

19
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,540
And so, without that appreciative
inquiry, and without that

20
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:20,620
belief that your sort of colleagues in
your organization is healthy in the way

21
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:23,940
that I just described,
your options are super limited.

22
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:28,850
I can't fix the problem because
it's the attitude of my colleagues.

23
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:33,030
And so what I want you to try to do is I
want you to view the situation you're in

24
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:37,090
as maybe an inevitable
result of early successes.

25
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:41,560
And this really changes the paradigm
to one of like, okay, everything that

26
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:45,080
we did to get us here today has
been super helpful and awesome.

27
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:49,790
It also cannot be or may not be what
takes us forward to the future.

28
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:51,200
So what is that going to look like?

29
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,360
And then you can turn right to those
same people who created the current

30
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,020
awesome in your organization.

31
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:58,787
Yes, some pain came with that,
but the current awesome.

32
00:01:58,787 --> 00:02:03,106
And you can work with them, through
inquiry, to find new ways forward.

33
00:02:03,106 --> 00:02:08,300
[MUSIC]

34
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:12,958
So the healthiest mindset you
can have as you approach DevOps

35
00:02:12,958 --> 00:02:17,390
transformation is one of inquiry and
appreciation.

36
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:19,890
So appreciation for
your environment, appreciation for

37
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:25,070
your colleagues, even an appreciation
for the problem domain.

38
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:30,280
It's very easy to see the limitations
of your system in the present moment,

39
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,750
so it's easy to blame.

40
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:35,320
It's much harder to look
to your colleagues,

41
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:38,520
to look to the situation as
an opportunity to create new things.

42
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:43,640
And I think that's the heart of
DevOps is being able to recognize

43
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:48,560
that there is a path forward, and
that path forward is only going to be

44
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:53,340
realized when we work together, when we
take a stance of appreciative inquiry.
