1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Now using the same premise as before, P equals 0.8, cost equals -4 and gamma equals 1,

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I'd like you to run value iteration to completion.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
For the one state over here, a4, I'd like to know what is it's final value.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Now you might be tempted to write a piece of computer software,

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
but for this specific state, it's actually possible to do it with a relatively simple peice of math.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
It's not trivial, but give it a try.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 99:59:59,999
What is the value of a4 after convergence?
