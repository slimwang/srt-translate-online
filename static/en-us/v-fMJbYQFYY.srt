00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:04,130
Many companies today have made deep
learning a central part of their

2
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:05,580
machine learning toolkit.

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:10,090
Facebook, Baidu, Microsoft, and Google
are all using deep learning in their

4
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:12,670
products and
pushing their research forward.

5
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:14,510
It's easy to understand why.

6
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:17,350
Deep learning shines wherever
there is lots of data and

7
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:19,070
complex problems to solve.

8
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:21,890
And all these companies are facing
lots of complicated problems,

9
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:24,850
like understanding what's in
an image to help you find it, or

10
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:27,900
translating a document into another
language that you can speak.

11
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:32,140
In this class,
we'll explore a continuum of complexity,

12
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:36,290
from very simple models to very large
ones that you'll still be able to train

13
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:40,160
in minutes on your personal computer
to do very elaborate tasks.

14
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,690
Like predicting the meaning of words or
classifying images.

15
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:46,730
One of the nice things about deep
learning is that it's really a family of

16
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:50,330
techniques that adapts to all sorts
of data and all sorts of problems,

17
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:53,680
all using a common infrastructure and
a common language to describe things.

18
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,920
When I began working
in machine learning,

19
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:59,330
I was doing research
on speech recognition.

20
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:01,900
Whenever I met someone
working on computer vision or

21
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:05,440
natural language processing, we had
very little in common to talk about.

22
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,400
We used different acronyms,
different techniques, and

23
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,760
collaboration was
pretty much impossible.

24
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,520
Deep learning really changed that.

25
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:15,470
The basic things that you will learn
in this class are applicable to

26
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:19,450
almost everything, and will give you
a foundation that you can apply to many,

27
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:21,230
many different fields.

28
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:25,010
You'll be part of a fast growing
community of researchers, engineers, and

29
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:28,530
data scientists who share a common,
very powerful set of tools.
