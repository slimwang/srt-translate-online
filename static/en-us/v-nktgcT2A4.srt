00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Here's my solution to this quiz.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
We first add this link

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
that was passed in as a parameter to our links list.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
And then we add it to our index by saying link.id=link

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
into the global index here.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
And let's go ahead and give this function a test.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
The first thing we need to do is create a link, so I'll do that now.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
So we create a new link, and it's going to have id 50.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
And then we needed a user id, a submission time, and number of votes,

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
which we'll just set to 1 for now.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
It needs a title and a URL.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
So that should make a link.

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
And now let's actually call our function add new link L.

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
And now, let's make sure it works.

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
So the first thing I want to do is make sure we added it to the list link.

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
So we're going to say print links negative 1,

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Which will print the last element in our list of links.

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
And that's where this link should be

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
because we appended it to that list.

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm also going to print link by id 50.

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
So these should actually print the same thing

22
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
and they should both be our new list--or our new link.

23
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Let's go ahead and give that a shot.

24
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Ta-da! All right, so we've updated our list,

25
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
and we've updated our index--pretty cool.

26
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
So as you can see, an index is really handy

27
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
making reads simpler so you don't have to iterate over the entire list,

28
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
but there's a certain maintenance cost to having them

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
in that you have to keep it up to date when you're updating the rest of your database.

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
And you can imagine if you had multiple indexes on your table,

31
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
which you can,

32
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
every time you insert a new element into your table,

33
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
you need to update all of these indexes.

34
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Okay, great. Let's move on to another quiz.
