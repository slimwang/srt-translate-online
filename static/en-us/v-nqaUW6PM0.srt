1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,174
So we have this new right triangle

2
00:00:02,174 --> 00:00:05,177
but what is this vertical distance here?

3
00:00:05,177 --> 00:00:07,824
When you think you know it, type it in here

4
00:00:07,824 --> 00:00:10,924
and I have already included the units of centimeters.

5
00:00:10,924 --> 00:00:15,803
You will also want to round your answer
to the nearest tenth.

6
00:00:15,803 --> 00:00:20,206
So you should have one digit after the decimal point.
