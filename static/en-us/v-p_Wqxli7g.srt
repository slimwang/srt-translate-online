00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,411
We've already seen that we can solve the equation x squared equals negative 1.

2
00:00:04,411 --> 00:00:08,720
Using our new kind of numbers, imaginary numbers. And we got x equals plus or

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,849
minus i as the solution to this equation. We should be able to then, solve

4
00:00:12,849 --> 00:00:17,515
equations like this. X squared equals negative 9. Please write your solutions in

5
00:00:17,515 --> 00:00:20,041
this box and simplify them as much as you can.
