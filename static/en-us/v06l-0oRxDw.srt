00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,660
We've talked about potential places
where your app can really shine and

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:05,470
where it can really fail.

3
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:09,680
Being on the development team of an app
can lead to a certain type of blindness.

4
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:10,860
You know the app so

5
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:15,960
well that you naturally miss some of the
pain points a new user might run into.

6
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,920
This is where bringing in external
feedback can be extremely helpful.

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,850
As soon as you publish your app, or even
beforehand, when showing it to testers,

8
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:26,020
you get a flood of advice.

9
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:29,620
This feedback can be a great
source of new perspectives and

10
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:32,900
give you insight into exactly how
people are using your app, or

11
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:35,580
even better,
how they want to use your app.

12
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:36,620
Having a large,

13
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:41,040
diverse set of users can be one of
the keys to building a successful app.

14
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,880
Remember, that while feedback from
others who have built Android

15
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:46,980
apps can be helpful, it shouldn't
be your only source of feedback.
