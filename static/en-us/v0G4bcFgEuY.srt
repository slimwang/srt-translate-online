1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The answer is it only helps us if we know something else about K.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
The reason for this is if K is uniformly distributed,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
and we're XORing it with these other values,

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
whatever patterns that M and S have are lost when they get XORed with K.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
This is the whole point of the one-time pad that we can

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
XOR a random key with a message and hide all the statistical properties in the message.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
This is not the case that it helps us by itself.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
If this was all we knew this is a potentially interesting property,

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
but we need to know something more in order to use this to help break the cipher.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Knowing something more about M would be great.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
That's the message we're trying to decrypt, but that's separate from being able to use

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
this property in a useful way.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 99:59:59,999
What we really need to do is know something more about K.
