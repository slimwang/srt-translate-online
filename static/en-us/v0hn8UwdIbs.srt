1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:03,080
Here, we can see
onActivityResult is implemented.

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:06,340
It takes a requestCode and
a resultCode as integers.

3
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:09,280
And it also takes an Intent
that we call data.

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:11,600
Then we want to take
a look at the requestCode.

5
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:15,890
And if it's RC_SIGN_IN, we will then
want to take a look at the resultCode.

6
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:18,290
If the resultCode is RESULT_OK.

7
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:21,480
Then we set our SignInProgress
to STATE_SIGN_IN.

8
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,010
That means that
the error was successful.

9
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:27,090
But we may want to continue
catching more errors.

10
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:29,720
Otherwise, if we didn't get a RESULT_OK,

11
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:32,299
then we believe that
we're actually signed in.

12
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:34,490
So we set our SignInProgress
to be signed in.

13
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:35,930
And then finally,

14
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:39,810
if we reach the stage where the Google
API client is still connecting.

15
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:42,700
Then we just want to call
GoogleApiClient.connect(), so

16
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:44,050
that we can continue the cycle.
