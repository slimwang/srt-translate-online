00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,786
For obvious reasons, we don't know what or if a fetus is thinking inside its

2
00:00:03,786 --> 00:00:09,512
mother's womb. But we do know a lot about what infants think. In fact, we know

3
00:00:09,512 --> 00:00:13,608
a lot about the development of cognitive abilities across the lifespan from

4
00:00:13,608 --> 00:00:18,612
Swiss psychologist Jean Piaget. Piaget argued for distinct stages of

5
00:00:18,612 --> 00:00:23,462
development across the lifespan. The first stage he termed the sensory motor

6
00:00:23,462 --> 00:00:29,718
stage. Infants lack verbal behavior. They cannot think about the past and they

7
00:00:29,718 --> 00:00:34,290
can't plan for the future, therefore they live very much in the present moment.

8
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:38,870
In the here and now. However, they do interact with their world. They use their

9
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:43,156
five senses. They can see, touch, taste, smell, and hear, and they use these

10
00:00:43,156 --> 00:00:49,001
senses to make sense of their world. This is what Piaget meant by the sensory

11
00:00:49,001 --> 00:00:51,200
part of sensory motor stage.
