1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:04,132
Looking to the left of the graph, just before we reach 0, it looks like we fall

2
00:00:04,132 --> 00:00:08,356
way below negative infinity, and just after x equals 0, the graph reappears way

3
00:00:08,356 --> 00:00:15,256
up high, and then comes back down for positive infinity. So, as we approach x

4
00:00:15,256 --> 00:00:18,469
equals 0 from the left the graph falls low, but as we approach from the right,

5
00:00:18,469 --> 00:00:20,570
it rises way high.
