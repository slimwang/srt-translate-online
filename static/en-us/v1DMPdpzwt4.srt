00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,280
The boat travels at 25 miles per hour, great algebra solving if you found that

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:09,820
answer. We know the lowest common denominator for this equation would be x

3
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:15,489
minus 5 times x plus 5. So, we multiply our equation through by the LCD. These

4
00:00:15,489 --> 00:00:21,160
binomials cancel with one another, leaving us with this equation. Here on the

5
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:27,292
right hand side I recognize that this was the difference of squares pattern. So

6
00:00:27,292 --> 00:00:32,438
I just have x squared minus 25 a squared minus b squared. Next we distribute to

7
00:00:32,438 --> 00:00:37,599
get this equation. Now we just want to combine my terms. 10 x plus 15 x equals

8
00:00:37,599 --> 00:00:45,408
25 x. And positive 50 minus 75 equals negative 25. Next we add 25 to both sides

9
00:00:45,408 --> 00:00:48,771
or just remove the negative 25 since it's balanced on each side of the

10
00:00:48,771 --> 00:00:55,392
equation. This leaves us with 25 x Eequal to x squared. We have a quadratic

11
00:00:55,392 --> 00:00:58,926
equation, so we want to move this term to the other side, with the positive x

12
00:00:58,926 --> 00:01:05,731
squared term. This allows us to set our equation, equal to 0. Now we're in a

13
00:01:05,731 --> 00:01:10,420
position to factor this quadratic. I've rewritten it here, and then I factored

14
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:16,578
an x out of each of these terms. So I'll have x times x minus 25. Now we set

15
00:01:16,578 --> 00:01:23,505
each factor equal to 0, leaving us with x equals 0, or x equals 25. So there

16
00:01:23,505 --> 00:01:28,745
are actually two possible values for x, 25 or 0. But since the boat is actually

17
00:01:28,745 --> 00:01:34,156
moving, we know it can't be zero. Therefore, the boat must move at 25 miles per

18
00:01:34,156 --> 00:01:36,150
hour in still water.
