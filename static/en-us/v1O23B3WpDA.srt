1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:01,630
So now that we know that we have four

2
00:00:01,630 --> 00:00:04,150
mobile constraints, that we can't violate when we're building

3
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:06,500
and designing mobile applications our users are going to have

4
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:09,550
a really bad time. Let's deep dive into these four.

5
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:12,090
>> Yeah, we'll talk about what happens when you actually do get

6
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:15,070
them wrong, and what the implications are to your user in your app.

7
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:16,239
>> So let's get started with a quiz.

8
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:20,460
>> So we have an application here on the screen. And as you can

9
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:25,480
see a user is using this media player application to actually play a video.

10
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:30,800
So you can see a couple of things, it's on a three g network. The power is about

11
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:35,600
half, it's 3:20 pm I guess, the application is in

12
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:40,610
landscape mode. And they've played about halfway through the video. We can also

13
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:43,140
see that the app has defaulted to 1080p resolution to

14
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:45,970
play this video. So there is a ux fail happening

15
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:48,270
here. I want you to think about which one of

16
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:51,150
these elements that I've highlighted are contributing to this fail, and

17
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:52,020
select it on the screen.
