00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:05,270
I'm sure you have noticed that this class has a subtitle, cognitive systems.

2
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:09,430
Let's talk about this term and break it down into its components. Cognitive,

3
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:13,850
in this context, means dealing with human-like intelligence. The ultimate goal

4
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:18,650
is to dwell up human level, human-like intelligence. Systems, in this context,

5
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:23,310
means having multiple interacting components, such as learning, reasoning and

6
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:28,615
memory. Cognitive systems, they are systems that exhibit human level,

7
00:00:28,615 --> 00:00:33,110
human-like intelligence through interaction among components like learning,

8
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:38,150
reasoning and memory. Thus, on a spectrum, what we'll discuss in this

9
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:41,960
class will definitely lie on the right side of the spectrum, on the human side.

10
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:44,470
We will be talking about thinking and acting, but

11
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:47,050
we will always be concerned with human cognition.
