2
00:00:06,082 --> 00:00:10,445
As you can imagine, anything as institutionalized as an online course has

3
00:00:10,445 --> 00:00:15,310
a strict set of policies to which the students and faculty must adhere.

4
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:19,090
Of course, Georgia Tech has an honor code linked to in the instructor's notes

5
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:23,770
that you should read and follow. Unless explicitly stated in the description of

6
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:28,120
an assignment or project, all work you submit must be your own.

7
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:32,689
The course makes use of the Piasa forum, which allows you to ask questions and

8
00:00:32,689 --> 00:00:36,680
otherwise communicate with your fellow students. You are encouraged to ask for

9
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:39,930
clarifications and about the details of a particular tool or

10
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:43,410
technology. But you should not ask for nor provide answers to

11
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:48,000
questions that are an explicit part of the assignment or project. This course is

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,740
officially administered using T-Square. All material will be turned in

13
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:56,090
using T-Square according to the specific instructions of the assignment or

14
00:00:56,090 --> 00:01:00,700
project. Any changes of policy or due date will be announced on T-Square, and

15
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:05,050
you are responsible for monitoring T-Square to obtain the latest information.

16
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:09,890
The projects and some of the assignments require you to turn in written reports.

17
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:13,240
The format of these documents should adhere to Georgia Tech standards as

18
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:16,500
described on the page linked to from the instructor's notes.
