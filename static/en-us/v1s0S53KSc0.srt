00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:03,070
Any answer you might have given for
this quiz should work, so

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:04,970
let's go over some of these items.

3
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:09,940
All right, I'm going to scroll down and
download a spreadsheet for magnitude 4.5

4
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:13,250
and higher earthquakes that occurred
within the past seven days.

5
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:18,213
And then I'm just going to
import this into Google Sheets.

6
00:00:18,213 --> 00:00:20,949
[BLANK_AUDIO]

7
00:00:20,949 --> 00:00:23,500
Cool, this lets me look at
the data a little easier.

8
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:27,200
All right, so
I'll reposition these cells.

9
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,500
Now I can see everything clearly.

10
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,630
By the way,
this data is given to us in CSV format.

11
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:36,300
And CSV just stands for
comma-separated values.

12
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:40,060
This is a very simple text based format
that puts each row of data on its own

13
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:43,610
line, and
the columns are separated by commas.

14
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:46,100
Most spreadsheet programs,
including Excel and Google Sheets,

15
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:49,520
support importing CSV files,
which we just did.

16
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,730
Here I can browse all
the data in a spreadsheet.

17
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:57,030
I can see the columns for
time, latitude, longitude,

18
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:02,218
depth, magnitude,
even over here I have place.

19
00:01:02,218 --> 00:01:05,810
So I imagine for this half it's probable
that I want to display things like

20
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:08,640
place, time, and of course magnitude.

21
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,990
Those would be my top picks for
the first round of this half.

22
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:16,230
Later on I might want to add things
like latitude, longitude, and depth.
