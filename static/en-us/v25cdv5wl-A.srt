00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:04,430
Today, we'll talk about production systems. I think you're going to enjoy this,

2
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:07,120
because part of production systems is going to do with learning.

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,550
And this is the first time in the course we'll be talking about learning.

4
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:14,240
Production systems are kind of cognitive architecture,

5
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:20,695
in which knowledge is represented in the form of rules. This is the last topic

6
00:00:20,695 --> 00:00:25,380
under the fundamental topics part of the course. We'll start by talking about

7
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:29,740
cognitive architectures in general, then focus on production systems,

8
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:33,460
then come to learning, a particular mechanism of learning called chunking.
