00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,510
Let's create a weather provider class within the

2
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:06,236
data package. We'll have it extend content provider. [SOUND]

3
00:00:06,236 --> 00:00:08,942
You can have the required method by heading

4
00:00:08,942 --> 00:00:13,309
Ctrl+I once more. Content providers implement functionality based upon

5
00:00:13,309 --> 00:00:15,676
the URI's. Each URI type is tied to

6
00:00:15,676 --> 00:00:20,220
an integer constant. Our content provider will implement five

7
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:23,280
different types of URI's. Each one of these

8
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:25,750
URI's will be used for different types of queries.

9
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:31,840
For now, lets just add these constants into our weather provider class.

10
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:37,010
Android provides a URI matcher class to help

11
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:40,850
match URI's to our integer constants. It provides

12
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:44,640
for an expression syntax to match various URI's.

13
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,020
Now these are just examples. You're going to have

14
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:49,840
to implement one of these very soon. Note,

15
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,630
that there are two wildcards. The pound sign

16
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:59,710
is used to match a number, while a star is used to match a string. Using this,

17
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:03,110
you can very, very easily match any of the URI's

18
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:05,570
that we would want to pass in to our content provider.
