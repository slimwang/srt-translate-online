I think that we need to start at x equals 0. Remember that x stands for the

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:07,644
number of days that have passed since Grant started using his advertising

3
00:00:07,644 --> 00:00:11,704
agency. We can't really have negative days, or at least in this situation that

4
00:00:11,704 --> 00:00:15,479
doesn't make sense. So I think that the graph should start here and then

5
00:00:15,479 --> 00:00:19,406
continue upward just as we had it. So this would just be omitting the values

6
00:00:19,406 --> 00:00:22,574
where we would have a negative number of days having passed.
