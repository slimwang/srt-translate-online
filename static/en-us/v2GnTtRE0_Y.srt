Here are a bunch of different coordinate spaces. You're sending a model down

00:00:03,415 --> 00:00:06,340
the pipeline, select the coordinate type the model starts in, and which types

3
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:11,170
it may go through. In practice we might skip one of these coordinate steps.

00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:14,509
What I'm looking for here is for every blank to have a letter from this list.
