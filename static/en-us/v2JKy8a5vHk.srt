00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:04,830
In modular exponentiation there is a
very nice property of quotient function

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:06,010
from number theory.

3
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:10,160
That is,
if you raise x to the power of y mod n,

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:15,980
the result is the same as x raised
to the power y mod quotient n.

5
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:20,640
Given this property,
if y equal to one mod quotient n then

6
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,440
if you raise x to power y mod n,
the result is the same as x mod n.
