1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:01,120
>> So lets talk about a new

2
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:02,850
kind of value function, that's going to actually make

3
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:05,070
that optimization part easier and the learning

4
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:07,770
part easier. So but it's really closely related

5
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:11,130
to the stuff you talked about, Charles, so let's let's start with what you told

6
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:15,750
us. Which is here's a definition of, of you. This is, we're going to define you.

7
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:16,350
>> Mm.

8
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:17,470
>> And put you in a box.

9
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:19,520
>> It's been tried before.

10
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:23,260
>> It can't be done. All right, so well, you know, if you,

11
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:26,290
if you're a good dog, I'll give you some pie next. So U,

12
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:27,542
>> [LAUGH]

13
00:00:27,542 --> 00:00:30,890
>> [LAUGH] U is defined for each state, the utility

14
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:33,640
being the state, this is, the long-term value of being in

15
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:36,680
a state is the reward for arriving in that state,

16
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:40,110
plus the discounted reward of the future, and what's going to

17
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:42,070
happen in the future? Well, in the future, to leave

18
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:44,930
this state we're going to choose some action, then we're going to

19
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:48,092
take an expectation over all possible next states. And we're

20
00:00:48,092 --> 00:00:51,290
going to arrive in some next state, S prime, and then U

21
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:53,740
is representing the utility of that as well.

22
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:55,970
So this is, is recursive and nonlinear, but

23
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:57,060
we know how to solve this, we can

24
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:59,130
use things like value iteration to do that. Agreed?

25
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:00,080
>> Agreed.

26
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:03,310
>> Alright, and you also said, here's how you can use this quantity to

27
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:06,730
decide what to do. That the policy in a state S is, well, let's

28
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:10,360
consider all of the actions we can take to leave that state. We'll look

29
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:13,605
to what their expected values are, so

30
00:01:13,605 --> 00:01:16,590
we'll iterate over all the possible next states

31
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:18,790
weighted by their probability of the utility of

32
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:20,210
landing in the state that we'd end up in.

33
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:20,680
>> Mm-hm.

34
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,540
>> And that, that tells us how to behave.

35
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:23,110
>> Yes.

36
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:24,430
>> Alright, so these are, these are the value

37
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:26,650
functions, well the value function of the policy that

38
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:28,610
we talked about before. Here's our new kind of

39
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:32,310
value function. It is sometimes called the Q function. Though,

40
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:33,840
you know, some people in the know don't like

41
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,250
that. It's, it's called the Q function because it's

42
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:39,460
the letter Q. But it's, some people have said

43
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:41,590
that it stands for quality but it's just, it's just

44
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:45,770
a letter in the latter half of the alphabet, you know, V was taken, U was taken,

45
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:47,330
you know, W is used for weights, like,

46
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:50,100
Q was available. So, it was brought to bear.

47
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:54,020
So, so this is, this is a, a new definition and you can see it's got elements

48
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:58,240
of the other two. Let me maybe write down what it, it, a way to interpret this.

49
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:58,750
>> Okay.

50
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:03,390
>> So, again, here's the, the Q function. And what we're going to think

51
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:07,310
of this as, is, this is the value for arriving in some state, S.

52
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:08,610
And this is, you know, this is the reward we

53
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:12,290
get for, for that arrival. Then what we're going to do is

54
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:16,090
we're going to leave S via action A. So we're going to add

55
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:19,110
to that the discounted expected value that we get for taking

56
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:22,460
action A. It's going to now drop us to some next

57
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:25,590
state S prime, according to this probability, and once we land

58
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:29,420
in S prime, we're going to take whichever action has the highest

59
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:32,660
Q value from there, okay? So that turned out to be

60
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:34,870
the value for arriving in S, leaving via A,

61
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:37,610
and proceeding optimally thereafter. Like once, once we get

62
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:38,920
to a new state, we're going to be choosing the

63
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:42,050
best actions each time. Does that work for you?

64
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:44,910
>> It makes sense right, because you could, U is basically defined the

65
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:46,770
same way. It's the value for arriving

66
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:49,250
in S and then proceeding optimally thereafter.

67
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:51,670
>> That's right. And all the, the only thing that we're doing here is

68
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:55,319
we're, we're basically tying the algorithm's hands

69
00:02:55,319 --> 00:02:57,870
briefly. We're saying, we're going to force

70
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:00,990
you to leave via ac, via action A. After that, do the normal

71
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:03,825
thing. But just for a moment I'd like you to just take action A.

72
00:03:03,825 --> 00:03:05,900
>> Mm-hm. Okay, that makes sense. So you

73
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:08,230
just, you, you inserted basically a, a kind

74
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:10,210
of, kind of utility step in there that I

75
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:12,180
assume you're about to use in some clever way.

76
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:13,670
>> Indeed, yes, this is going to turn out

77
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:15,200
to be really helpful, because it's going to allow us

78
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,880
to compare the values of different actions without having

79
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,920
to actually stare at the model to do it.
