00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,800
Now that you have seen what data dependencies

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:05,530
look like, let's do a data dependencies quiz

3
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:07,840
to see if you can find data dependencies

4
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:10,500
in the program. Let's say that these are

5
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:14,634
four instructions in our program. Instruction one multiplies

6
00:00:14,634 --> 00:00:16,880
R2 and R3, puts the result in R1.

7
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:21,076
Instruction two takes R4 and R1, adds them

8
00:00:21,076 --> 00:00:25,580
up, and puts the result in R4. Instruction three

9
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:31,510
multiplies R5 and R6, puts the result in R1. And the subtract here, instruction

10
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:38,290
four, subtracts R1 from R4 and puts the result back in R4. You need to indicate

11
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:42,130
whether there are any dependencies between instruction

12
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:44,209
I1 and I2. For each of these three

13
00:00:44,209 --> 00:00:48,350
types of dependencies, is there such a dependence?

14
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:51,390
You need to do that also for I1

15
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:57,670
to I3, I1 to I4. So is there a dependence from I1 to I4?

16
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:03,215
And from I2 to I3. To help you out, I'm going to tell you that there is a

17
00:01:03,215 --> 00:01:06,370
read after write dependence here. That there is

18
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:10,410
no write after read dependence from I1 to

19
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:13,200
I2. And that there is no write after

20
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,230
write dependence. I'm also going to tell you that

21
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:21,159
there is no read after write dependence here. But

22
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:25,140
you need to figure out the remaining eight dependencies.

23
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:27,670
Put a check mark in each of these boxes

24
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:30,270
if there is such a dependence between these instructions.
