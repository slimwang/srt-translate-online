00:00:00,184 --> 00:00:02,545
And, now, comes the hard part. I want you to

2
00:00:02,545 --> 00:00:04,825
calculate the actual density. We know that the

3
00:00:04,825 --> 00:00:08,994
density for the birth time to be before noon is

4
00:00:08,994 --> 00:00:13,033
twice as large as the density for being born

5
00:00:13,033 --> 00:00:16,257
after noon. So, here is my density function,

6
00:00:16,257 --> 00:00:20,802
time of day X, Nf of X and youâ€™ve already

7
00:00:20,802 --> 00:00:22,657
identified the shape. And, thereâ€™s now two

8
00:00:22,657 --> 00:00:26,200
parameters, A and B. I want you to figure out

9
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:29,952
for me what A is and what B is, assuming that

10
00:00:29,952 --> 00:00:34,497
the basic unit here is in hours. Put differently,

11
00:00:34,497 --> 00:00:39,387
there is 24 hours horizontally in this interval

12
00:00:39,387 --> 00:00:40,674
. As a hint, make sure that the

13
00:00:40,674 --> 00:00:44,011
area underneath sums up to 1.
