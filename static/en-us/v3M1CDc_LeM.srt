1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Now looking at this same data, I'd like

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
to ask you a different question.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Suppose we draw a line at a 45-degree angle,

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
This represents the relationship y = x

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
and divides the plot into 2 regions

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
or 3 if we count the line itself.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
We have a region here

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
above the line and a region here below the line.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
What I'd like you tell me is

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
what the position of a point relative to

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
these 3 sections tells us about

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
the given students' GPAs.

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
So in which of these regions would a student

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
with the same GPA in high school and college fall?

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Would it be above the line,

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
on the line or below the line?

17
00:00:47,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Select the region in which you think it is.
