00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
This question asks about perfect ciphers.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Assume that m1 and m2 are messages selected from M, the set of all possible messages.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
You should not assume that all messages are equally likely.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
c is a ciphertext selected randomly from the set of all possible ciphertexts.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
k1 and k2 are keys selected randomly from K, the set of keys.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
The question asks to check all statements that are true.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
If a cipher has fewer keys then possible messages, it is not a perfect cipher.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
AES is a perfect cipher.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
If the probability of m1 encrypted using the key k1 equals c is

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
greater than the probability of m2 encrypted using the key k1 equals c,

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
then E--the encryption function--must not be a perfect cipher.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
The last statement--if E is ap perfect cipher, then the probability of m1

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
encrypted using k1 equals c is equal to the probability of m1

14
00:00:48,000 --> 99:59:59,999
encrypted using key k2 is equal to c.
