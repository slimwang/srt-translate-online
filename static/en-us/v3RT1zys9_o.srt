00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,120
There are a lot of other
resources besides the manual for

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,330
finding out about shell command stuff.

3
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:08,100
Even experienced users can always
find something new that can be

4
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:09,330
done in the shell.

5
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:12,370
But if you don't know what a command
does and you're not sure if you want to

6
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:16,460
run it, applying your favorite search
engine to the problem is a good idea.

7
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:19,900
You can put any shell command
into Google or DuckDuckGo or

8
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:23,180
Yahoo or whatever and
usually find a lot of help.

9
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:25,380
In fact, let's do that now.

10
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:28,690
Here's a command that you should
definitely research, but don't run it.

11
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:29,390
Seriously, don't.

12
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:36,020
Open up your favorite search engine and
look up this command, rm -rf /.

13
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:40,059
You might need a search keyword
such as shell or command.

14
00:00:40,059 --> 00:00:41,890
What does this command do?

15
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:44,650
What do the r and the f stand for?

16
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:47,010
Put your description of what
this command does based on your

17
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:48,260
research here.

18
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:53,120
And does the r stand for
read, recursive, or root?

19
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,970
And does the f stand for
force, file, or flag?
