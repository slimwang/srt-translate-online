1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Well, our rule for statement is statement goes to id equals expression,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
so this box has expression in it.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Then expression goes to expression minus expression.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Since this number was 6, this number must be 5.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
By the way, Yggdrasil is worth knowing about.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
It's the World Tree in Norse mythology.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 99:59:59,999
My drawing of it is clearly not to scale.
