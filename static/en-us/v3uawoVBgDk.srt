00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:03,062
The first thing I'll do is I'll ask the user for a value. Could be a floating

2
00:00:03,062 --> 00:00:06,936
point value because the water could have gone down by a fractional amount. I'll

3
00:00:06,936 --> 00:00:10,470
read the next double and if the value is negative, I'll increment the counter.

4
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:14,124
Now, if I want the user to keep on entering more values, I'll need to tell them

5
00:00:14,124 --> 00:00:18,966
that. And it looks like I forgot colon space on the first one. That wouldn't

6
00:00:18,966 --> 00:00:21,716
have looked very pretty. Fix that in my compile errors, and it looks like I'm

7
00:00:21,716 --> 00:00:26,750
ready to go. If I run the program, I can enter values, and I've entered two

8
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:33,450
negative values now, so if I finish, I expect to see the count as two. And if

9
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:36,622
looks like the water line fell on two years. I'd probably want to fix out the

10
00:00:36,622 --> 00:00:40,133
spacing before I shared this. But right now I'm counting all of the negative

11
00:00:40,133 --> 00:00:42,539
numbers just the way I wanted to.
