00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,344
Let's try this method of dividing the numerator by the denominator to find the

2
00:00:03,344 --> 00:00:08,488
horizontal asymptote with this new function. F of x equals 3x minus 8 over x

3
00:00:08,488 --> 00:00:15,199
minus 5. What do you get if you divide 3x minus 8 by x minus 5? Put your answer

4
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:16,160
in this box.
