1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:03,090
So you can say, well, it's awkward
kernel design at the heart or

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:04,860
the center or core of it.

3
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:07,070
What really goes into it?

4
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:10,690
What is included in the trusted
computing base when it is done

5
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:13,380
by using the security
kernel kind of an approach.

6
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:18,050
So we said, well, last one we're saying
everything that is necessary for

7
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:21,820
the mechanisms, that are necessary for
correct enforcement of security policies

8
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:24,220
we want to have in
the system should go there.

9
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:28,570
We know resources are implemented
using physical resources we have,

10
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:33,380
so any I/O that's necessary to access
your physical resources, primitive I/O

11
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:37,640
has to be handled in there, which
includes clocks, interrupt handling,

12
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:42,190
at least capturing the interrupt,
and being able to directly access

13
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:46,340
the hardware resources with whatever
capabilities that are necessary for it.

14
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:49,770
In memory, for example,
we said we have TLBs or

15
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:52,580
speeding up the address translation
process and things like that.

16
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:57,190
So who can manipulate those control
part of memory, somebody can use.

17
00:00:57,190 --> 00:01:00,550
So that kind of stuff, if you're doing
manager access control, then there's

18
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:04,910
label checking, that the model is
going to rely on notion of labels and

19
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:08,880
making sure secret information
doesn't flow into an object that is

20
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,560
unclassified and things like that.

21
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,360
So that's part of your security policy
and the correct enforcement, of course,

22
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:17,680
has to be implemented
by the security kernel.

23
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:22,920
And direct access to hardware resources
and their manipulation, and support for

24
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,510
these various models for access
control we have has to be in that.

25
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:29,010
The other thing we did is
sort of virtualization.

26
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:33,220
One way we get sort of a complete
mediation, and you can bypass it,

27
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:37,570
is that untrusted code is,
has handles who worked with resources.

28
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:40,188
Unless we're talking
about capability systems.

29
00:01:40,188 --> 00:01:45,240
So this virtualization, were putting
this mechanism going from virtual to

30
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:49,860
physical resources helps us isolate
the hardware from untrusted code.

31
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,360
It also allows us to do the separation
