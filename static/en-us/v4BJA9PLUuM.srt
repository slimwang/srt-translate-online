1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,230
Comparing with the external firewall,

2
00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:05,450
an internal firewall performs
more stringent filtering.

3
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:09,215
This is because the internal network
would require more protection,

4
00:00:09,215 --> 00:00:11,740
than the public facing systems on a DMZ.

5
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:15,685
The internal firewall protects
the remainder of the enterprise network

6
00:00:15,685 --> 00:00:17,745
from attacks launched from the DMZ.

7
00:00:17,745 --> 00:00:21,935
For example, if the public facing web
server in the DMZ is compromised,

8
00:00:21,935 --> 00:00:26,612
the internal firewall is to stop attacks
from that compromised web server.

9
00:00:26,612 --> 00:00:27,292
In addition,

10
00:00:27,292 --> 00:00:32,381
the internal firewall also controls
access to the DMZ from internal network.

11
00:00:32,381 --> 00:00:35,862
For example, only the authorized
traffic from the internal network

12
00:00:35,862 --> 00:00:40,432
can reach to the DMZ to change the
settings of a public facing web server.

13
00:00:40,432 --> 00:00:44,812
For example, such activities must
be from a sys admin's work station.

14
00:00:44,812 --> 00:00:48,632
In addition, multiple internal firewalls
can be used to protect different

15
00:00:48,632 --> 00:00:51,130
parts of the internal
network from each other.

16
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:54,820
That is, even if one part of the
internal network has been compromised,

17
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:57,320
the other parts are still
being protected by their own

18
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,180
internal firewalls.
