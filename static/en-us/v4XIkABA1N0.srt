1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
To define linear regression,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
we need to understand what we are trying to minimize.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
The word is called here, are loss function

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and the loss function is the amount of residual error we obtain

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
after fitting the linear function as good as possible.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
The residual error is the sum of all training examples,

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
J of YJ, which is the target label,

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:34,000
minus our prediction, which is W1 XJ minus W0 to the square.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
This is the quadratic error between our target labels

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
and what our best hypothesis can produce.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The minimizing of loss

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
is used for linear regression or any regression problem,

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
and you can write it as follows:

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Our solution to the regression problem W*

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:59,999
is the arg min of the loss over all possible vectors W.
