00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:05,190
Well, one obvious answer is HTTP. This is a web based application, and most,

2
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:10,110
web communication uses the HTTP protocol. These days,

3
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:14,330
a second protocol often is part of these kinds of interactions, and

4
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:20,670
that's AJAX, in which the web browser, and the web server cooperate.

5
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:26,180
In a more timely fashion, then going in a kind of round trip HTTP page rewrite

6
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:31,110
situation. Third, is the fact that, ultimately we're updating a database.

7
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:34,590
Typical databases are relational databases and the standard language for dealing

8
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:38,880
with relational databases is SQL. So SQL can be thought of as a protocol.

9
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:44,130
In typical applications like that, the SQL is embedded inside of PHP.

10
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:49,360
You can think of PHP, as a language but any language is in itself a protocol,

11
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,829
that is, has certain rules for how it's programs are expressed.
