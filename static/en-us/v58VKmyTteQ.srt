00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,969
This example of a recursive
reduction uses two spawns.

2
00:00:03,969 --> 00:00:08,540
But I wonder, are they both
necessary in this specific example?

3
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:11,460
Let me pose this as
the following question to you.

4
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:16,490
Which of these spawns may be
eliminated without increasing the span?

5
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:19,490
And when I say without increasing
the span, I mean asymptotically.

6
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:22,300
Here are your answer choices.

7
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:25,770
Is it the case that you
can eliminate A but not B?

8
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:27,870
B, but not A?

9
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:32,259
Or is it the case where you can
eliminate A or B, but not both?

10
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:35,510
Or finally, is the answer that you
can't eliminate either one of them.

11
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:38,060
That you have to keep both spawns.

12
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:40,150
Why don't you pick one,
then stay tuned for the answer.
