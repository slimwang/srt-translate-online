1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:02,580
We showed you how to do
the first two steps.

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:05,020
If you still need help with those,
that's no problem at all,

3
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:07,100
you can just watch
the previous video again.

4
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:11,080
Now I'll show you how to update
variables within the decrement method.

5
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:14,150
We ask you to initialize
the quantity variable to 1, and

6
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:16,760
update it down to 1 cup of coffee.

7
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:19,360
I'm going to make the code change
in the MainActivity.java file in

8
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:20,780
the decrement method.

9
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:24,110
We're creating a quantity variable and
initializing it to 2.

10
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:27,500
Then I'm going to add another line of
code that updates the quantity variable

11
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:28,630
to be 1.

12
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:31,690
And lastly, I displayed this
new value to the screen.

13
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:34,270
Let's run the app to
check that it works.

14
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:36,330
If I hit the minus button,
then it decreases down to 1.

15
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:38,044
I can add a breakpoint here and

16
00:00:38,044 --> 00:00:42,540
run the debugger to show that
the quantity variable is being updated.

17
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:45,990
I'm going to click on this debug
tab to open the debug pane.

18
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:49,030
I click on the minus button to
trigger the breakpoint here, and

19
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:52,120
then step through each line of code.

20
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,850
At this point,
the first sign has executed, so

21
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:57,620
the quantity variable has a value of 2,
and then it changes to a value of 1.

22
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:59,650
And then I can just resume the app and

23
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:01,824
the app should update to
have a quantity of 1.

24
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:04,620
And there it goes.

25
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:07,660
All right, I think we've nailed
the concept of how to update an integer

26
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:11,990
variable to a new number and
verify its value in the debugger.

27
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:13,130
This is still limited, though.

28
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:16,070
There are actually other ways to
update a variable aside from just

29
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:17,530
setting a fixed literal value.
