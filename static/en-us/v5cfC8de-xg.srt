00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:03,542
It's clear that evolution, genetics, and epigenetics come together to make us

2
00:00:03,542 --> 00:00:07,979
who we are, and this is truly an amazing process. We could devote an entire

3
00:00:07,979 --> 00:00:12,040
course to this, but we just don't have the time in Introduction to Psychology.

4
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:15,550
>> If you've enjoyed the topics we've covered so far in genetics for this course,

5
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:20,580
you should check out our other course, Tales from the Genome. Where we'll delve

6
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:23,982
deeper into the topics of genetics and learn a lot more about DNA, identity,

7
00:00:23,982 --> 00:00:25,500
and health.

8
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:29,194
>> Thank you so much for your help on this, Matt. But now, it's time for us to

9
00:00:29,194 --> 00:00:32,360
move on to something that's equally as astonishing and that's our brain. It's

10
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:36,850
truly amazing how our brain works and how complex of a system it is. So, we're

11
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:39,490
going to devote some time looking at the different functions and structures of

12
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:42,530
the brain because they're going to come up in future lessons.
