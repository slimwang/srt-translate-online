00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,721
As we increase n toward infinity, the number we have for A over here gets

2
00:00:03,721 --> 00:00:09,810
closer and closer to a certain very special number. That number is e. But what

3
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:14,240
on earth is e? We haven't been using that letter to stand for anything. Well,

4
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,664
this is a very important point. e is actually a number, an irrational number to

5
00:00:18,664 --> 00:00:23,684
be precise. And we can approximate it as 2.718281828459, and of course, this

6
00:00:23,684 --> 00:00:29,359
decimal continues forever, since this number is irrational. It's a number that

7
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:35,275
has special significance for higher level mathematics, biology, chemistry and

8
00:00:35,275 --> 00:00:41,349
many other fields. So it's really exciting that we're going to get to work with

9
00:00:41,349 --> 00:00:45,426
it. Conveniently, scientific calculators also generally have buttons for e on

10
00:00:45,426 --> 00:00:50,535
them. On my calculator, it's right here, and when I press it, well, it just

11
00:00:50,535 --> 00:00:56,542
types the letter e. But if we press equals, then you see a rounded version of

12
00:00:56,542 --> 00:01:03,352
this number. Now, remember, this is not the exact value of e, this is an

13
00:01:03,352 --> 00:01:06,247
approximation.
