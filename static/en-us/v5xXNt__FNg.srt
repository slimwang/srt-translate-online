1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
One further thin that I want to talk about is

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
do we disable assertions in production code?

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
For example, when we run the Python interpreter with the "-O" option,

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
which causes Python to enable some optimizations,

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
it disables assertions in order to make our code run faster.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
The question we're asking here is is that a good thing?

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
It turns out that there are arguments we can make in both directions.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Let's first look at reasons why we might want to disable assertions.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
One of the main advantages of disabling assertions

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
would be that it lets our code run faster.

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Another advantage--and here we're starting to get into something,

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
which really depends on what we're trying to do with our system--

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
is that code running without assertions is less likely to stop running.

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The code keeps going even after some sort of condition is found within the code

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
that would have triggered an assertion violation

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
if assertions had been enabled.

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Here we really have to ask ourselves the question

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
what is it that we're trying to do with our system?

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Is it better to keep going or is it better to stop?

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Remember that keeping going after some condition is true

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
that will lead to an assertion violation may lead to a completely erroneous execution.

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
On the other hand, possibly, that's better than actually stopping.

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Now let's move to disadvantages of disabling assertions in production code.

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
If our code happens to rely on some side effect performed by an assertion--

25
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
that is to say, if whoever wrote the code that we're using has violated

26
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
one of the rules for assertions that I gave you--

27
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
then turning off assertions is going to break the code.

28
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Not only is it going to break the code, but it's going to break the code

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
in an extremely confusing way, because lacking assertions,

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
we're going to have a very hard time detecting the error

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
except that it's probably going to cause our system to crash in some confusing way

32
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
or just to do completely the wrong thing.

33
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
This is a real risk of turning off assertions in large systems.

34
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
The second reason is even in production code

35
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
it may be better to fail early rather than keep going.

36
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Really, it just depends on what our system is doing.

37
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
The question is do our users want the system to die

38
00:01:49,000 --> 99:59:59,999
or do they want the system to give them some completely wrong result?
