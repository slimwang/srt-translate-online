1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:01,940
Before you tackle the next mini project,

2
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:03,850
I want you to hear from Scott Murray again.

3
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:06,450
Scott has some excellent advice for breaking into the field.

4
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:11,670
If you could go back and sort of give yourself advice for

5
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:13,360
when you first started in the field.

6
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:17,920
When you first started making individualizations, what advice would that be?

7
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,260
>> My advice would be.

8
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:25,420
To just find topics I'm really excited about and go pursue them,

9
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:26,140
which I sort of did.

10
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:29,120
But secondly, to get that stuff published and

11
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:31,560
out on the web and start sharing it, like, sooner.

12
00:00:32,564 --> 00:00:36,762
I know with sort of my personal experience there's this feeling.

13
00:00:36,762 --> 00:00:40,850
Like, I can't put something out into the world until it's, like, polished and

14
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:44,296
finished and perfect and really exciting or amazing.

15
00:00:44,296 --> 00:00:45,980
I know students get that a lot, too.

16
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:47,180
It can be really intimidating.

17
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:50,429
Especially if you're studying works by people who are doing you know,

18
00:00:50,429 --> 00:00:52,605
at least on paper having all kinds of a success.

19
00:00:52,605 --> 00:00:54,570
And like, doing all these amazing projects.

20
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:57,890
It can be really intimidating to be like, oh, here's this little chart I made.

21
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:00,756
Or here's this you know, thing that's so, feels so

22
00:01:00,756 --> 00:01:03,060
insignificant or it might have problems.

23
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:07,780
But I think really that's how you get established in this,

24
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:08,710
probably in a lot of fields.

25
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:12,260
But especially in this field where it's all about sharing and

26
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:13,350
this visual communication.

27
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:15,680
And then, having people respond to that graphic.

28
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:20,210
because the graphics are not just kind of endpoints, or

29
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:21,940
the visualizations aren't just endpoints.

30
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:25,420
But they're really sort of you know starting points for

31
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:27,568
the rest of the conversation.

32
00:01:27,568 --> 00:01:29,816
So one thing this is especially true I guess for

33
00:01:29,816 --> 00:01:31,714
design students as in you have to do it now.

34
00:01:31,714 --> 00:01:33,990
You know, you have to have a web based portfolio.

35
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:37,500
You have to have something on the web where you can publish things and

36
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:38,360
get it out there.

37
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,987
And like engage people and get a response.

38
00:01:40,987 --> 00:01:45,103
So I would say you know, start making stuff as quick as you can and

39
00:01:45,103 --> 00:01:48,640
start putting it out there as quick as you can.

40
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,409
And certainly engaging with other practitioners and

41
00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:55,262
you know, critiquing in a helpful way.

42
00:01:55,262 --> 00:01:59,743
So trying to provide helpful advice and

43
00:01:59,743 --> 00:02:04,650
not just It's kind of too easy to cut down the things that aren't very good.

44
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:08,570
like, there's been some discussion, kind of in the community,

45
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:10,199
about this recently.

46
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:12,210
On what's the value of critique?

47
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:13,600
And what kind of critique is helpful?

48
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:19,270
Somebody uses you know, quote, unquote, bad colors it's very easy to be like,

49
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:21,300
oh, well those are you know, horrible colors.

50
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,330
It makes it too hard to read, or something.

51
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:24,600
Instead of saying, those are horrible colors.

52
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,590
Say you know, maybe this is somebody new who's coming in.

53
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:29,560
And they're trying to learn how to do a good job.

54
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:32,750
Encourage them with hey, why don't, can I suggest these better colors?

55
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,860
Or, can I suggest this other visual representation.

56
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:38,360
So I think part of it is, you know, getting your stuff out there.

57
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:43,450
But it's also being friendly and supportive and you know, hopefully kind and

58
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,410
empathizing with the people who are new, who are just coming in.

59
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:48,450
>> Okay.

60
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:48,950
Great.
