1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:05,330
Let's take a look at the GIF editor view
controller in the Objective C project.

2
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:07,640
We can see that it has three properties.

3
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:14,020
A GIF image view, a GIF, and then in
the .m file a caption text field.

4
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:16,520
If we look through
the implementation file.

5
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:19,750
We see the view controller
lifecycle methods.

6
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:23,870
We see a bunch of code for
formatting the caption text field.

7
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:27,380
We see the UI text field
delegate methods, the code for

8
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:29,285
adjusting the keyboard.

9
00:00:29,285 --> 00:00:32,755
And then a method
called present preview.

10
00:00:32,755 --> 00:00:37,455
Okay, here we are back in the GIF editor
view controller in the SWIFT project and

11
00:00:37,455 --> 00:00:39,635
we'll start by adding those properties.

12
00:00:39,635 --> 00:00:42,500
We already have a property for
the GIF image view.

13
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,040
So we need to add a property for

14
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:48,060
the caption text field which we
can drag in from storyboard.

15
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:53,400
And we'll replace this GIF URL
property with a property called GIF.

16
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:56,560
And we're not really sure when this
GIF property's going to be set.

17
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:57,740
So we'll make it an optional.

18
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:01,430
Next you're going to want to
go back to the method,

19
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:06,650
convert video to GIF, this is in the UI
view controller record extension.

20
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:12,360
Now, instead of passing the GIF URL
from the convert video to GIF method,

21
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:16,000
let's go ahead and
initialize an instance of the GIF and

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,170
then instead of passing the GIF URL.

23
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:22,900
We'll just pass the GIF as a parameter
to the display GIF method, and

24
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:26,820
then we'll go back to our GIF
editor view controller and

25
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:30,700
set the GIF image view
in view will appear.

26
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:34,060
So instead of GIF from recording.

27
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:37,960
It should be gif.gifimage.

28
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:40,400
Now let's run it and see how it looks.

29
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,830
This will also tell us if everything
is in order with our GIF class.

30
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,430
All right, okay.

31
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:48,800
Let's launch the camera.

32
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:51,120
Whoa!

33
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,600
Super we can still see our GIF.

34
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,500
So it looks like everything's
in order with the GIF class.

35
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:02,420
Hopefully you will be
able to see your GIF too.

36
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:06,040
And now we'll move on to implement
the UITextField delegate methods.
