00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,350
Now that we've learned from users, we're going to iterate our designs, and

2
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:05,680
then we'll commit to them. And we're going to wrap them up in

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:08,780
a presentation. Before we do that, let's go check in with the

4
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:12,510
students at Udacity office, and hear what they've learned from this project.

5
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:15,290
>> I wanted to feel good when I use this

6
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:20,800
up. So say someone came on or within your range. But

7
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,020
what if you see a flower or a fun picture that

8
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:25,510
you like. Hmm; Hmmm. It adds a click, but it makes

9
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:28,390
me feel good and I'm happy to compensate for a click,

10
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:30,710
as far as it makes me feel good. So you click

11
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:33,580
on that and then it shows you the map and shows

12
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:35,990
you the person that you're most likely to barter with or

13
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:39,680
exchange or transact with, and gives a little profile of who

14
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,490
they are and What they're wanting to offer. Once you dig

15
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:47,440
deeper there's a screen that tells you how many hours you

16
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,680
have. So these were just supposed to be coins that you

17
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:53,350
have 16 hours right now and for this transaction you need three

18
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:56,010
hours. There's a little button that can help you transact, and once you

19
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:59,240
have transacted makes you feel better by showing you an ice cream

20
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:03,950
cone or a heart sign, or some image that makes you feel nice.

21
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:08,920
>> I like the fact that you're putting a focus on that one person.

22
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:16,030
So if that's like a mutual thing, like if you got shown Clifton's profile, and

23
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:18,840
then Clifton gets showed Kanall's profile, you

24
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:22,090
establish that mutual connection. It's much more kind

25
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:25,220
of deep and meaningful than just seeing like

26
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:27,060
a list right? And you pick from list.

27
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:31,090
>> Yeah because it seemed to me as if the, the soul of the business.

28
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:32,010
>> Mm-hm.

29
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:35,000
>> Was about exchanging hours and not

30
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,190
money. And that was, it was already fun.

31
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:40,970
>> I like the flower idea, I would've taken that from you,

32
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:43,240
if you don't already have it on camera, the thought of it.

33
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:43,980
>> You should take it.

34
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:44,770
>> It's okay.
