1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,000
So here's my solution, which is
basically exactly the same values.

2
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:08,140
To help you see that I've included
a little trace, here on the left.

3
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:12,280
This row is the set of initial values.

4
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:16,460
This row is what happens
after i = 0 completes.

5
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:19,710
Basically all the values shift by one.

6
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:23,230
because shifting by one is essentially
what this funny indexing corresponds to.
