1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,230
So let's discuss the solution
to this exercise.

2
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:06,370
So for this first functionality,
in order to save a new pet,

3
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:09,440
well this requires inserting
information to the database, so

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,000
we'll call the insert method.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,030
Next, to display an existing pet,
this requires us to read information

6
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:18,520
out of the database, so
we'll be calling the query method.

7
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:20,712
Thirdly, in order to
update an existing pet,

8
00:00:20,712 --> 00:00:24,490
well as its name implies, we'll need to
update information from the database,

9
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:26,710
which means we'll call
the update method.

10
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:30,570
And fourth, to delete an existing pet,
we should call the delete method.

11
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:34,580
And lastly, to delete all the pets,
we'll also be calling our delete method.
