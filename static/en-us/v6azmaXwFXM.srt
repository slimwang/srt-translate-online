00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,600
Let's try out some of the other options
to ls that are given in the man page.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,720
Ls-l is a pretty good one.

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,630
The l stands for long listing.

4
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:10,500
Try the command in your own terminal.

5
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,630
What information do you
see when you run ls-l?

6
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:15,280
Can you see the filename?

7
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:19,080
Can you see the modification
time of items in the folder?

8
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,180
Can you see the file sizes?

9
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:24,330
Can you determine whether you're
looking at files or directories?

10
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:27,920
Can you determine the virus scanning
status of the things in the directory?

11
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,430
And can you figure out what program is
used to open the files in the directory?

12
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:32,659
Check all the options that are true.
