00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:05,832
Here we're practicing the pattern for collecting values in a class. Here's is

2
00:00:05,832 --> 00:00:09,888
already the instance variable that does the collecting. Before we forget, let's

3
00:00:09,888 --> 00:00:15,624
make sure it's initialize in the constructor, here we go. By the way, I did

4
00:00:15,624 --> 00:00:19,581
forget that when I prepared the solution. Let's see here, here we need to add a

5
00:00:19,581 --> 00:00:26,080
strain to the collection, here's the code for that. Now sometimes, the code

6
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,524
really is as simple as this. It's still necessary to have a separate method

7
00:00:30,524 --> 00:00:34,748
because of course passengers is a private instance variable that the public

8
00:00:34,748 --> 00:00:40,309
can't use. In our example, the add passenger method is a bit more complex

9
00:00:40,309 --> 00:00:45,680
because we should only add when there's space. Last time around we had a

10
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:51,146
counter for the number of passengers. We don't have that this time, but we have

11
00:00:51,146 --> 00:00:56,104
a method, down here. So I'll just call that method. And again if there's room,

12
00:00:56,104 --> 00:00:59,770
then I'll do the adding. I don't expect that we actually have to implement that

13
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:04,233
method, that's simply the size of the collection. The last method here, gives

14
00:01:04,233 --> 00:01:09,377
us more information about the contents of our collection. Unfortunately it's

15
00:01:09,377 --> 00:01:14,184
already been implemented. It simply returns the array list converted to a

16
00:01:14,184 --> 00:01:20,723
string, which, has this characteristic form. All of the strings inside,

17
00:01:20,723 --> 00:01:25,906
surrounded by brackets. So that's the general collection pattern, any time that

18
00:01:25,906 --> 00:01:31,030
an object wants to collect other objects. Using the array list or an array such

19
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:35,638
as this one, and did I mentioned, that you should never forget initialize the

20
00:01:35,638 --> 00:01:41,715
array list or array in the construction. You will get to practice these

21
00:01:41,715 --> 00:01:45,740
patterns with another example that's dear to Sarah's heart.
