00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The answer is that it's permutations.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
That's what the definition of permutations is.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
We take some collection, and then we pick out some number of them.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
The order matters, and we have all possibilities.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
So there is a built-in permutations function.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 99:59:59,999
It happens to be in a library called "itertools."
