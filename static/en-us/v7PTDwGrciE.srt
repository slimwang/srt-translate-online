00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:04,840
The topic today is the Object Constraint Language, a part of UML.

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:09,270
So far when we've looked at UML we've been looking at diagrams. But

3
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:13,710
diagrams don't tell the whole story. There are places in the specifications and

4
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:17,189
the designs of your system where you need more details. And

5
00:00:17,189 --> 00:00:23,930
that is what OCL was designed to provide to designers.

6
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:26,510
OCL is a language, it's not a programming language,

7
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:31,350
it's a specification language. It's declarative, it's strongly typed, and

8
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:35,300
allows you to specify the functional details of system properties.

9
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:44,660
OCL consists of a means to express constraints plus some collection classes.

10
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:50,405
And an ability to navigate around the various classes

11
00:00:50,405 --> 00:00:56,178
of relationships in your diagrams. OCL's a mature technology is part,

12
00:00:56,178 --> 00:01:00,689
an official part of UML and supported by various tools. Such as Rational Rose,

13
00:01:00,689 --> 00:01:05,510
ArgoUML, Eclipse, Poseidon, Enterprise Architect and so on
