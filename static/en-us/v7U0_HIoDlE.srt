00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Here, we test your knowledge of Java script environments and scope

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
along with a little bit of info on Native North American peoples.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
As the text of the problem suggests, we're going to solve it

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
by working out the nested environment diagrams.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
So let's start with the global environment.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
In the global environment, we define a function Apache,

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
and the first thing we do is call it with the inputs 9 and 10.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
So this is going to create a new environment for that function call of Apache.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The inputs were 9, which corresponds to Iroquois.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
And the second was 10, which corresponds to Ottawa.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
We then set Seneca to 1 and we declare and set Creek to 2.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:49,000
When we print out Seneca, we're going to look at the lowest environment, which is Apache.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
We see Seneca as 1. Iroquois is 9. Ottawa is 10.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:03,000
We now declare a function Cherokee, and we call it with the inputs 777 and 888.

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Since we're going into a new function, we create a new environment.

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,000
777 gets assigned to Seneca, which is a local variable, and Creek gets a value of 888.

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
We print out Seneca, which at the closest scope is 777.

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
We then print out Iroquois. It's not in the scope of Cherokee.

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
So we go up to Apache and Iroquois is defined as 9.

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:33,000
We now print out Ottawa. Ottawa is not defined here in Cherokee but it's defined in Apache as 10.

21
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
And lastly, we're going to print out Creek. Same deal. Not defined in Cherokee but is in Apache.

22
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Now we do some modifications. We set Seneca to 33. We set Creek to 44.

23
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
We set Iroquois to 55. It's not in Cherokee.

24
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
So we're changing the value of Iroquois in the Apache environment.

25
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Then we set Ottawa. We leave this function and now we're printing out Seneca.

26
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Since we've left the Cherokee function, this environment no longer applies.

27
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
And we're simply looking at what's in Apache. The value of Seneca is 1.

28
00:02:07,000 --> 99:59:59,999
The value of Iroquois if 55. The value of Ottawa is 66. The value of Creek is 2.
