1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:00,990
Well, okay.

2
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:01,670
I got this.

3
00:00:01,670 --> 00:00:02,270
I got this.

4
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:04,054
I got, oh, no.

5
00:00:04,054 --> 00:00:05,447
[NOISE]
>> Hey, whatcha doing there?

6
00:00:05,447 --> 00:00:07,178
>> I'm building an awesome new app and

7
00:00:07,178 --> 00:00:09,890
it's using a ton of
cool libraries I found.

8
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:12,380
>> Oh, your libraries are in
these Java archives here?

9
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:14,160
>> What? No. These are just jars.

10
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,770
Anyway, a bunch of the libraries
I'm using are themselves using

11
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:18,450
even more libraries.

12
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:20,540
>> Which gives you even
more jars to juggle, right?

13
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:21,670
>> What do my jars have
to do with anything?

14
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:23,160
I'm making jam later.

15
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,350
Anyway, I checked all my jars
into source control, but

16
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:27,480
now it takes forever for
me to check anything out.

17
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,960
And anytime one of my libraries updates,
it's just a giant pain to sort out.

18
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,300
>> You know that Gradle can take care
of this whole problem for you, right?

19
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,390
>> Well, Gradle can do just
about everything, can't it?

20
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:36,450
>> It's true.

21
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:39,170
Gradle makes using external
dependencies super simple.

22
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:41,880
It can take care of downloading
your dependencies from repositories

23
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:45,580
either hosted by your organization or
publicly available out on the internet.

24
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:48,000
It can also handle your
trends div dependencies.

25
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,650
That is the dependencies
of your dependencies.

26
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:53,420
It even makes sure that if you're using
the same dependency across multiple

27
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:56,560
projects you'll only ever
download dependency once.

28
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,290
No more juggling jars.

29
00:00:58,290 --> 00:00:59,560
>> Hey Mark, you want any jam?
