1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
So one of the areas where this kind of ordering process takes place in social network analysis

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
is in measuring the centrality of different nodes.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
We talked a little bit about centrality in the previous unit,

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,000
but let me talk a little bit about some different types of centrality that you might find useful.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
One that we're going to return to,

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
and we've already kind of touch on is this node of closeness centrality.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The idea that a given node is central if it has short path to other nodes in the network.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Between this centrality has to do with the idea that a node is central

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
if most of the shortest path between arbitrarily chosen pairs of nodes in the network

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
end up having to pass through the node in question.

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
It's between most to the other nodes. It's kind of stuck between them.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Node centrality is actually a much simpler concept,

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
which says that the node is central if it has lots of edges

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
If it's very well connected, and this is well connected in a very local sense

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
just in terms of the degree of the node or the number of neighbors that it has.

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Let's look at this one first and then we're going to combine

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:16,000
what we learned with other kinds of path base metrics next.
