00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:01,589
There's one last thing I would
like to teach you today,

2
00:00:01,589 --> 00:00:03,580
and it's called Template Inheritance.

3
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:07,360
Now, we can make this quite complex, but
for our purposes we're just going to do

4
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:10,860
this simple thing that'll make
our templates much easier to use.

5
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:13,180
If you notice on a web page,
let's draw one.

6
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:16,470
Most web pages have a title and
a footer.

7
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:18,670
And then they have some
content in the middle.

8
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:20,850
This might be the page slash.

9
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:24,120
And then you might have another
page that looks identical.

10
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:26,839
Maybe this is the /about page.

11
00:00:26,839 --> 00:00:28,464
It also has a title.

12
00:00:28,464 --> 00:00:30,770
It also has a footer.

13
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:35,110
The same title and the same footer,
and has some different content.

14
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:39,350
When you generate in HTML, you don't
want to have to write the same title and

15
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:41,030
the same footer over and over again.

16
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:43,110
Just like in your code
when you use functions and

17
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:44,800
classes to better organize your code, so

18
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,720
you don't have to write the same
piece of code over and over again.

19
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:50,070
You can organize your
templates in the same way.

20
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:51,940
And that's what I want to
talk about right now.

21
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:53,850
You can use template inheritance.

22
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:58,160
So you can have one template
that includes the header,

23
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:03,436
and the footer and
then you can have a bunch of

24
00:01:03,436 --> 00:01:07,590
subtemplates that redefine
the content in the middle.

25
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:09,970
So here's how we're going to
organize our code now.

26
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:11,478
So here's what we have
right now in our code.

27
00:01:11,478 --> 00:01:16,750
We have shopping_list.html, and
we have fizzbuzz.html, and these files

28
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:20,510
don't have anything in common, but we
want to add a little title to this page.

29
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:24,700
We're going to make each of these
inherit from the base.html.

30
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:27,547
And we're going to make each of
these inherit from base.html, and

31
00:01:27,547 --> 00:01:31,090
base.html's going to have
some common html that

32
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:34,970
these two templates will share to
make them match a little better.

33
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:38,420
And I'll just go ahead and
show you an example of how to do this.

34
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:40,195
So first thing I'm going to do is
I'm going to make a new filed called

35
00:01:40,195 --> 00:01:41,080
base.html.

36
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:44,210
I'm going to go ahead and put in things
I want these files to have in common,

37
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:47,500
and I'm also going to do
a proper HTML document this time.

38
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:48,260
I saved it as base.html.

39
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:51,732
Now remember,
HTML documents start with a doc type and

40
00:01:51,732 --> 00:01:53,401
then we have the html tag.

41
00:01:53,401 --> 00:01:55,920
And then we have the head.

42
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,230
And within the head,
we can have the title.

43
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:00,650
And so,
both our pages will share this title.

44
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:02,600
Within html, we have body.

45
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:05,310
And now,
I'm going to add a new syntax here.

46
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:09,030
Okay so then we have our body, open and
close, and then we close our html.

47
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:11,860
This is basic structure
of an HTML document.

48
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:15,330
And it's what goes inside body
that makes the page unique.

49
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:18,350
And I wanted to change that title too,
while we're at it, but

50
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:19,880
let's just worry about the body.

51
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:24,447
In jinja, the syntax that we can
use will look something like this.

52
00:02:24,447 --> 00:02:26,340
The syntax for creating a block, and

53
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:29,402
a block is something that will be
shared amongst templates, you just say,

54
00:02:29,402 --> 00:02:33,200
{ % block, and
then you give the block a name.

55
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,470
In this case, we're going to call it
content, and then you can say endblock.

56
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:41,180
And we can make each of our
templates use this block of content.

57
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:46,050
So, let's show how we would use
this base.html in shopping_list.

58
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:48,659
Let's add some code to our body that
all of our templates are going to

59
00:02:48,659 --> 00:02:49,331
have in common.

60
00:02:49,331 --> 00:02:52,222
I'm going to add a little
header across the top.

61
00:02:52,222 --> 00:02:55,667
Okay so if it's add a little title that
we're going to put across the top of our

62
00:02:55,667 --> 00:02:58,880
page, it's just an h1, and
I gave it a little extra styling.

63
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,280
This is CSS.

64
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:04,150
We gave it a background color of ddd,
and a foreground color of 888.

65
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:08,760
This is kind of gray with a slightly
darker gray on top of it.

66
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,930
I got rid of it's margin and
I gave it a height of 50px.

67
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:13,660
Also I'm going to add
a little style to the body.

68
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:16,470
This will make it layout
a little bit nicer, margin: 0.

69
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:19,590
Okay, so let's go ahead and
use this template in our shopping_list.

70
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:21,670
The syntax for this is quite simple.

71
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:26,870
All we do is at the top of our
file we say extends "base.html".

72
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:32,560
This tells this template that we're
going to be a part of base.html.

73
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,280
Now let's see what
this does in practice.

74
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,970
Let me make sure everything is saved.

75
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:38,090
Nothing here has changed and

76
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:40,550
our main handler, we're still
rendering shopping_list.html.

77
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:42,390
Let's go to our front page.

78
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:44,945
Okay, it's still quite a mess here,
let's reload this.

79
00:03:44,945 --> 00:03:49,365
Once I reload it, we can see that
the header that I wrote is here

80
00:03:49,365 --> 00:03:51,435
with the kind of grey
on grey background.

81
00:03:51,435 --> 00:03:52,375
But none of our content is here.

82
00:03:52,375 --> 00:03:54,205
Let's look at the source for this.

83
00:03:54,205 --> 00:03:57,605
Okay, we basically see this
is our base.html file, but

84
00:03:57,605 --> 00:04:00,815
we're not seeing any of that content
because that was in that block content,

85
00:04:00,815 --> 00:04:02,260
and we didn't overwrite that.

86
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:04,540
Let's go ahead and
take a look at our templates again.

87
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:05,720
This is our base.html.

88
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,980
This is basically what we were
seeing as the source in our browser.

89
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:12,550
But our shopping_list.html hasn't
actually filled in this content yet.

90
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:14,160
Let's see how we do that.

91
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:19,100
All you do is here,
you say block content.

92
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:21,540
And this line here, block and

93
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:26,000
then the name content,
matches this line here in base.html.

94
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,430
And I've put a closing one
at the bottom, endblock.

95
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:33,560
We save this file and
we go back to our browser.

96
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:37,360
Then when I reload this page,
we see all of our stuff done here now,

97
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,250
within our base.html template.

98
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:44,310
And when we view the source,
we can see we have the base.html header.

99
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:47,553
Then we can see we have our form
contents, here in the middle.

100
00:04:47,553 --> 00:04:51,110
And then we can have down here, it's
hard to see because of the scrolling,

101
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:54,130
but the end of the base.html template.

102
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:55,120
So, that's pretty handy.

103
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:59,770
This allows us to separate the content
of our pages and the templates for

104
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:02,330
that content from
the surrounding content that

105
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:04,530
all of our other pages
might have in common.

106
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:07,615
And I use this a lot in this course,
especially during the blog and

107
00:05:07,615 --> 00:05:08,720
some of the other things.
