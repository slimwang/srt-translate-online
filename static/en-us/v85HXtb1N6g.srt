1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:04,075
Now what is glucose? Glucose is a simple sugar in the blood, and it provides

2
00:00:04,075 --> 00:00:09,330
energy for the cells throughout the body, including the brain. Now, if we go

3
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:12,693
for a long time without eating, our blood sugar drops, and in turn the

4
00:00:12,693 --> 00:00:16,587
hypothalamus, which monitors glucose levels, will signal the drive to obtain

5
00:00:16,587 --> 00:00:23,154
food. Thinking back to the homeostatic model for motivation, we see this

6
00:00:23,154 --> 00:00:26,610
example of the brain detecting a lack of glucose, and then signaling for us to

7
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:33,744
obtain food. Some of the hormones that stimulate our appetite are neuropeptide

8
00:00:33,744 --> 00:00:39,160
Y, melanin, and ghrelin. For example, when we are hungry, neuropeptide Y is

9
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:44,258
released from the hypothalamis. And that in turn causes us to be hungry.

10
00:00:44,258 --> 00:00:49,840
Similarly, ghrelin levels rise when we're hungry and fall when we are full.

11
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,220
Another naturally occurring chemical that can increase our appetite are the

12
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:57,688
endocannabinoids. This is one reason why marijuana is sometimes used

13
00:00:57,688 --> 00:01:01,700
medicinally, to stimulate appetite, when other medicines make people nauseous

14
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:06,540
and unable to eat. On the flip side, research has shown that blocking the

15
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:10,404
receptor sights for the endocannabinoids actually decreases eating and results

16
00:01:10,404 --> 00:01:12,420
in weight loss.
