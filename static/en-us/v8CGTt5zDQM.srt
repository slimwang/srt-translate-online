1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,920
Now when you make these changes and
look at the results in DevTools,

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:07,250
you should see that the box
sizes are different but

3
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:11,110
there's not actually any change
to the layout of the page.

4
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:14,890
First, let's take a look at our My App
page before we make the change.

5
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:20,360
Notice that the image is 595 pixels wide

6
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:23,110
while the description is
also 595 pixels wide.

7
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:27,010
It's basically the length
of our current screen.

8
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:33,290
Then, when we add our CSS style,
save, and refresh,

9
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:38,640
note that our image is now 460 pixels,
which is how we defined it.

10
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,010
Then, when we make our changes and
refresh the page, notice that the image

11
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:48,500
is now maxing out at 460 pixels,
and when we resize the screen

12
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:54,930
our description then
maxes out at 705 pixels.

13
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:55,620
The layout,

14
00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:00,215
however, has remained unchanged and it's
still not looking like our design mock.
