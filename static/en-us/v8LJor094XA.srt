1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,630
Let's just do a few of these things,
all right.

2
00:00:02,630 --> 00:00:07,150
Clearly, this lets us think about
clusters of pixels that are similar in

3
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:10,235
color because we get clusters of
pixels that are similar in color.

4
00:00:10,235 --> 00:00:12,650
Yeah, but why is that useful?

5
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:16,830
Well, one might believe that pixels
that are similar in color are ones that

6
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:20,730
are somehow supposed be treated
as a unit and pull them apart.

7
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:25,160
It certainly doesn't let us
understand the shape of objects.

8
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:29,430
Size, yeah, not so much because you
can think of sort of the number of

9
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:33,420
pixels but that would only work
if an object was constant color.

10
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:36,890
Identify pixels that are different,
well maybe kind of etc.

11
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:41,150
and separate them so
we'll give that a partial credit.

12
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:43,310
Count how many pixels of
each color there are, well,

13
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:45,490
what do you mean each color?

14
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:48,420
Color's not like, you know,
are these all red?

15
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:51,490
I don't know, it's been, remember,
the idea is that color's going to be

16
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:55,420
a categorical thing that's operating in
psychology, psychological space, right?

17
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:59,710
All this lets us do is think about
clusters where it says similar in color,

18
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:01,730
so we're going to have
some notion of a distance.
