00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,110
The specific lesson objectives for this lesson are,

2
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:08,540
we will look at the photographic process for both digital and film cameras.

3
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:13,980
I will describe to you, the eight different layers that constitute a color film.

4
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:18,590
I will also describe the five layers of a generic CCD that's found in

5
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:19,899
most common cameras.

6
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:25,100
We will discuss the differences between a charged couple device, a CCD and

7
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:26,560
a CMOS sensor.

8
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,870
And I will discuss some of the benefits of using a camera raw format.

9
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:34,040
This will connect back to the lecture we had on different types of

10
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,440
image formats.

11
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,380
Remember, it's the image format that basically captures the pixels.

12
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:40,710
And it's the pixel values,

13
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:43,750
the intensities, which we want to be doing most of our processing on.

14
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:45,610
We will just take that up a notch and

15
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:48,010
talk about a camera raw format a bit today.
