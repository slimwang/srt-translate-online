Okay, edit all those things, and then hit Save again. And seems like it worked.

00:00:05,915 --> 00:00:08,572
That's cool. And it's right there in

>> Great. So let's go to an attendee record, or both of

magnifying glass. And send him to, what do you think?

12
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:33,260
>> Cloud Stock.

13
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:39,150

00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:39,383
>> Awesome.
