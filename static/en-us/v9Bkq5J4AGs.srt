00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,969
Let's discuss symmetric encryption.

2
00:00:02,969 --> 00:00:07,480
Recall that in symmetric encryption,
the same key is used for

3
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:09,880
both encryption and decryption.

4
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:13,140
The input is a plain text message.

5
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:17,460
The encryption algorithm takes the plain
text input, along with the encryption

6
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:21,120
key, and processes the plain
text using substitution and

7
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:24,570
permutation to produce ciphertext.

8
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:28,980
The decryption algorithm performs
a reverse of the encryption process.

9
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:33,570
It takes as input, the ciphertext,
and the key, which is the same

10
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:37,630
that was used for encryption, and
it produced the original plain text.
