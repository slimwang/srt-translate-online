00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,360
The answer to each question will
be depend heavily on the size of

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:04,740
the data transfers.

3
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:09,370
For a keyboard which likely will not
transfer much data for each keystroke,

4
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:14,200
a programmed I/O approach is better
since configuring the DMA may be more

5
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:19,700
complex than to perform one or
two extra store instructions.

6
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:24,090
For the network card the answer is
the popular, it depends, answer.

7
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:28,460
If we're sending out small packets,
that require that we perform

8
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:32,920
a less than five store instructions
to the device data registers,

9
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:36,200
given that the difference between
the store instruction and

10
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:40,620
the DMA controller in this hypothetical
example is one is to five.

11
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:43,220
Then it's better to perform program PIO.

12
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:47,184
If we need to perform larger data
transfers, then the DMA option will be

13
00:00:47,184 --> 00:00:50,817
a better one since we just need to
configure the DMA controller and

14
00:00:50,817 --> 00:00:52,220
then issue the request.
