1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:01,589
This is how the flow goes.

2
00:00:01,589 --> 00:00:04,480
The user logs in with the app,
calling auth with password or

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:05,950
auth with o-auth token.

4
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:08,420
This triggers
the unauthenticated callback.

5
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:11,750
It could also trigger any authentication
state listener you've added.

6
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:13,700
Finally, if I call get auth,

7
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:16,670
it will give me a valid auth
data object at this point.

8
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:19,110
>> Great, so
does that solve your problem?

9
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:22,770
>> Well I guess the answer to that one
is, it's just the AuthData object,

10
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:25,510
give us all the information and
everything that we need for the app.

11
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:28,730
>> I don't see why not,
what's everything in the app?

12
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:31,590
What will change in the app
bases on what user is logged in?

13
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:32,439
>> A lot.

14
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:35,560
For example, if Walter is logged in,
and he creates a list.

15
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:38,480
It should have is name as
the owner of the list.

16
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,080
Similarly, if he adds an item,
it should be attributed to him, so

17
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,870
that way we know who requested what.

18
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:45,948
It could get more
complicated from there.

19
00:00:45,948 --> 00:00:49,440
I probably want to add things
like it only shows lists

20
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,520
to the users that either made the list
or have the list shared with them.

21
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:55,660
I'll also want to record who
says they bought which items.

22
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:58,290
And maybe have even some
way of signaling that

23
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:00,560
users are currently in the store and
shopping.

24
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,120
>> Hm, that's a lot.

25
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:04,860
>> It is, but for now,
let's make this just a simple goal.

26
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:06,630
Number one, have a user log in.

27
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:09,870
And then number two,
that effect should show up in the app.

28
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:11,950
Here, let me show you
one of the screens.

29
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:15,710
>> So my first thought is,
does the AuthData object contain all

30
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:18,810
the information that we actually
need to be able to make this change?

31
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:20,800
And the other thing
I'm thinking about is,

32
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:24,620
how are we going to get the data from
the login activity to the main activity?

33
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:29,120
After all we get the authData here and
then somehow in the main activity we

34
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:31,400
have to pull up the information,
Walter's list.

35
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:34,530
So basically what's the best form for
this information and

36
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:38,090
what's the best way to move this
information around in our app, great.

37
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:40,740
And I think maybe we should
tackle the first question first.

38
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:43,160
Okay, so, what do you think?

39
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:46,250
Does the authData object contain
everything you need to display this

40
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:47,130
data here?

41
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:47,890
Let me know what you think.
