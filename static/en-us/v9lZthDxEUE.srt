1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,689
The options are the places where we can
specify the intrusion detection logic.

2
00:00:05,689 --> 00:00:08,820
There are four main
categories of rule options.

3
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:10,730
The first is meta data.

4
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:13,620
This does not actually
affect intrusion detection

5
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:18,340
because it contains information such
as revision number to the rule.

6
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:22,871
Payload, this is where we can specify
the logic to examine the packet payload.

7
00:00:22,871 --> 00:00:28,941
Non-payload, this is where we specify
the logic to examine the packet headers.

8
00:00:28,941 --> 00:00:32,630
Post-detection, this is where
we can specify triggers,

9
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:35,801
such as storing the packet
information in a table so

10
00:00:35,801 --> 00:00:38,620
that we can correlate
it with other packets.
