1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:02,130
Now it's time for you to add the functionality

2
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:04,850
to save entities to your app. Let's see how you

3
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:08,119
can achieve that. Okay. So here I'm looking at the

4
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:13,350
saveProfile method in the ConferenceAPI class. If you recall, we

5
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:17,000
already have the code to create a new profile.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,150
We just call new on the profile, and pass in

7
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:22,310
the arguments that we need. Creating a new profile entity

8
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:25,390
is as simple as calling new on the profile class.

9
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:27,770
If we weren't using objectify, the code would be

10
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:30,500
more complicated. You already have the code to create a

11
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,650
new profile object, but you don't need to make

12
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:35,580
any changes now that the profile has been identified as

13
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:42,100
an entity. However, creating an entity doesn't automatically save

14
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:44,890
it in the data store. You have to explicitly save

15
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:47,670
it if you want it saved. Okay, I'm going to

16
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:50,570
go ahead and add the code to save the profile

17
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:53,760
entity in the data store. You're going to be writing

18
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,830
this code yourself in your own app in just

19
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:57,910
a minute. Now, I'll run the app again on

20
00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:02,400
local host, and go to the APIs Explorer. So

21
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,180
here I am in the APIs Explorer and I'm

22
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:07,240
going to go into the Save Profile method again.

23
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:10,570
And, execute it. And have Lemon Cake as my

24
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:15,900
display name. Set my TeeShirtSize to M, and execute it.

25
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:23,340
Oops, I forgot to authorize. Let's try that again because that's not authorized.

26
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:30,310
Authorize. Now I can execute the function again, I

27
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:32,650
don't need to enter the values, just press Execute.

28
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:37,150
And there it goes. It's creating my profile. And

29
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:39,600
you see here, the request set the display name

30
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,060
to Lemon Cake, T shirt size to medium to

31
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:46,200
M. Response returned profile with these fields. So the

32
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,040
response shows that the profile was created. But this

33
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,270
time, hopefully it was more than created, it was actually

34
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:56,000
saved in the data store. And we can use the data store admin to check that. So

35
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,360
now I'm going to go to the admin console on local host. To get to the admin

36
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:04,675
console, you go to the port where your app is running, which is for me that's

37
00:02:04,675 --> 00:02:09,297
localhost:8080. And then it's

38
00:02:09,297 --> 00:02:16,330
/_ah/admin and this takes us to the Datastore view. The

39
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:20,060
Datastore admin for local host opens. You can see here

40
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:23,350
that it doesn't know what my app ID is. Says your

41
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:26,450
app ID, and that's okay, because local host doesn't care what

42
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:28,950
the app ID is. Course when I when actually want to

43
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:31,430
deploy to appspot I will need to provide a real app

44
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:35,980
ID. The admin console opens by default showing the Datastore Viewer.

45
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,840
But if you're somewhere else and you want to get back

46
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:41,550
to the Datastore Viewer, or for some reason it doesn't open

47
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:45,460
there by default, you just click this Datastore Viewer and there you are in the

48
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:50,030
Datastore Viewer. This entity kind menu shows the

49
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:52,710
different kinds of entities that are stored in

50
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:54,830
your Datastore. Right now, the only one

51
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:59,250
we've got is Profile. You'll click List Entities,

52
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,270
to seal the entities of that kind that

53
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:06,650
have already been saved. There'll probably be only

54
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:08,790
one entity now, which is the profile that

55
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:11,630
we just saved. So the data store viewer shows

56
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:13,670
you the entities, it shows you the properties. We've

57
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:18,050
got displayName, mainEmail, teeShirtSize. Okay, so that was just

58
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:22,570
a quick review of how to save the entity in the data store, and how to go to

59
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:25,430
the admin console on local host to look at

60
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:27,870
your entities. You're going to be doing that now.
