Let's take one last look at our drinking bird. This version is just key frames

00:00:03,982 --> 00:00:07,560
and if you compare it to the real thing it's not very true to life. One element

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:11,291
we haven't animated at all is the fluid level in the bird itself. The

4
00:00:11,291 --> 00:00:14,680
distribution of fluid matters to how the bird swings in the real world.

5
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:17,303
Simulating this effect would be a bit of work but once done properly would

6
00:00:17,303 --> 00:00:21,198
provide a true to life simulation of the physics of the situation. Perhaps the

7
00:00:21,198 --> 00:00:23,510
discoverer of the drinking bird equation will be you.
