1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:01,640
From this notion of a cut,

2
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:05,180
it's natural to think about how much
flow could possibly come across?

3
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:10,370
Well clearly it can't exceed the sum
of the capacity of the crossing edges.

4
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:14,465
This intuition gives rise to
the idea of the capacity of the cut.

5
00:00:14,465 --> 00:00:16,285
Which is, as I've said,

6
00:00:16,285 --> 00:00:20,155
just the sum of the capacities of
edges crossing over from A to B.

7
00:00:20,155 --> 00:00:25,799
In this case of this graph it's
just 2 + 8 which is equal to 10.
