00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:04,510
Okay, we've been talking a lot
about surfaces, elevation and

2
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:07,380
how surfaces behave when
you interact with them.

3
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:10,240
Let's take a quick quiz
to see how we're doing?

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,090
Here you see three different screens.

5
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:16,870
In each screen,
there's an app bar and some content.

6
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:20,730
But the surface arrangements in these
three screens is very different.

7
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:23,199
Notice the shadows
are a bit different here.

8
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:24,915
And when you scroll the content,

9
00:00:24,915 --> 00:00:29,060
the natural behavior of the surfaces
in each screen differs as well.

10
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:33,800
For each screen assuming the app
bar doesn't change its elevation

11
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:38,150
check the box if the app bar should stay
in place when you scroll the content.
