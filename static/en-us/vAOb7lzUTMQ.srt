00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:04,642
Since between group variability deals with the variability between groups

2
00:00:04,642 --> 00:00:10,566
obviously, then we are concerned with the number of groups we have. There are

3
00:00:10,566 --> 00:00:15,978
three groups and the degrees of freedom is then 2, for within group variability

4
00:00:15,978 --> 00:00:23,405
we add the degrees of freedom from every group 2 plus 2 plus 2 which is 6.
