1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:01,659
Awesome job.

2
00:00:01,659 --> 00:00:06,310
You have an app that sends and
receives messages and photos that

3
00:00:06,309 --> 00:00:11,219
uses authentication so you can limit
who can access and send messages and

4
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:15,250
it also limits the size of photos
to regulate storage space.

5
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:17,960
Now imagine this is your app.

6
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:22,410
You've just gone from a brilliant
idea to an even better execution.

7
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:25,309
You've tested it in all
sorts of conditions.

8
00:00:25,309 --> 00:00:27,469
You've gotten feedbacks from friends.

9
00:00:27,469 --> 00:00:30,910
And if that published your apps,
sharing it with the whole world.

10
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:32,189
So now what?

11
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:35,509
How do you know if your app
is working for your users?

12
00:00:35,509 --> 00:00:39,289
Well, you could go back and
ask friends for more feedback.

13
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:43,789
But surely your app is now being used
by people you've never even met.

14
00:00:43,789 --> 00:00:47,719
And their feedback is just as
valuable if not even more valuable

15
00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:49,619
then what your friends could tell you.

16
00:00:49,619 --> 00:00:52,509
Well, so
then you could send that survey out to

17
00:00:52,509 --> 00:00:56,309
all of your users to get all of that
feedback, but that is a huge ask for

18
00:00:56,310 --> 00:01:00,429
these people's time and most of
them just want to use your app and

19
00:01:00,429 --> 00:01:03,719
they probably dont want to be bothered
with helping you to help them.

20
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:07,500
And even if you had
surveyed all your users,

21
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,409
that wouldn't be the whole picture.

22
00:01:09,409 --> 00:01:14,729
It's what your users actually do in your
app that gives you the genuine feedback.

23
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:17,870
And here's where
Firebase Analytics comes in.

24
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:20,270
Firebase analytics is a free and

25
00:01:20,269 --> 00:01:25,920
unlimited analytics tool that gives you
insights on all aspects of your app.

26
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,370
It also integrates with
the other Firebase features and

27
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:34,200
Firebase analytics automatically
collects a handful of events for us.

28
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,180
Without any setup.

29
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:41,640
This means that Firebase analytics
has been collecting analytics data

30
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,769
this whole time while we've
been working on Friendly Chat.

31
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:50,620
This all happened when we first started
using Firebase and Friendly Chat.

32
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:53,463
So aside from the automatically
collected events,

33
00:01:53,463 --> 00:01:58,359
Firebase analytics gives you the
flexibility to define your own events.

34
00:01:58,359 --> 00:02:03,000
You can log things such as when a button
is pressed, when a screen of the app is

35
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,090
visited, or maybe how long users have
spent in any one area of your app.

36
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:12,490
This can help you see where users are
not spending time in your app, so you

37
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:17,350
can make data driven choices on where
to spend your limited developer time.

38
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:23,210
Now learning the techniques to best use
the insights from Firebase analytics

39
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:25,360
that could be a course in and of itself.

40
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,990
So we'll get started
with the basic here.

41
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:30,951
Specifically we'll check out
the analytic dashboard in

42
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:32,615
the Firebase council.

43
00:02:32,616 --> 00:02:35,790
And then we'll explore the data that's
automatically being collected by

44
00:02:35,789 --> 00:02:40,657
friendly chats, so we can dive into more
ways that you can understand your users

45
00:02:40,657 --> 00:02:42,521
behavior through analytics.
