2
00:00:16,884 --> 00:00:21,256
Okay. So now, we have our freshly printed website.

3
00:00:21,256 --> 00:00:23,762
I'm going to go ahead and clean things up a little bit, so

4
00:00:23,762 --> 00:00:25,971
we're only looking at what our mock up should be.

5
00:00:25,971 --> 00:00:29,036
Get rid of these extra colors and get rid of this extra margin on the side.

6
00:00:29,036 --> 00:00:29,604
[SOUND] So

7
00:00:29,604 --> 00:00:34,560
now, I'm going to go ahead and cut this up into a bunch of different boxes.

8
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:38,206
So you can see to start out, we have three main boxes.

9
00:00:38,206 --> 00:00:39,907
One for our header.

10
00:00:39,907 --> 00:00:43,929
One for the middle image and one for the bottom images.

11
00:00:43,929 --> 00:00:50,697
[SOUND] But there's actually a lot

12
00:00:50,697 --> 00:00:57,760
more than just three boxes here.

13
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:01,300
Looking at the header again, we have two more boxes.

14
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:06,283
One for the you and another for our name and title.

15
00:01:06,283 --> 00:01:07,881
So let's cut those out.

16
00:01:12,725 --> 00:01:15,338
We still have our single image in the middle here.

17
00:01:15,338 --> 00:01:20,206
But looking at our bottom featured work section, we actually have another box

18
00:01:20,206 --> 00:01:24,720
for our header and then three more boxes around our images and captions.

19
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,960
And you could actually keep cutting these up into more boxes.

20
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,750
We have another box around our images.

21
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:39,930
Another box around our titles.

22
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:42,004
Another around the URLs.

23
00:01:42,004 --> 00:01:45,234
But my hand is kind of cramping from all that cutting, so

24
00:01:45,234 --> 00:01:46,831
I'm just going to stop here.

25
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:52,870
Now as we just saw, I printed out the page and I cut it up with scissors.

26
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:57,090
But obviously, you could have done any of these and it would have worked out.

27
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:02,580
And you also should have found between 9 and 20 boxes depending on

28
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:06,500
how deep you went and how much you just love drawing boxes around things
