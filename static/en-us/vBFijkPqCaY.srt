00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:02,060
I've got the Flame view open, and

2
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:06,540
it's pretty apparent that some kind of
work is being repeated over and over.

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:08,980
I'll just go ahead and
zoom into one of these chunks.

4
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:10,340
With this closer inspection,

5
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:14,790
it becomes pretty obvious that render is
causing InitWebGLObjects to be called.

6
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:18,130
At the top, you can see that the code
ran for about 60 milliseconds,

7
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:21,390
which is well over the 16
millisecond budget per frame.

8
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:25,490
This unfortunately means that there is
no way this app is going to run at 60

9
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:26,550
frames per second.

10
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:29,390
Looking at the frame viewer at the top,
you can see that these frames are made

11
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:33,050
up almost entirely of JavaScript,
hence all the yellow bars.

12
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:36,010
This means that this code is definitely
going to need some refactoring

13
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:38,460
if it's going to run at
60 frames per second.

14
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:42,080
So the correct answers are,
render as the function and, no,

15
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:44,680
it is not going to run
at 60 frames per second.
