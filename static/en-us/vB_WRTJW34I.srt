00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,366
I'm feeling a little impatient. I don't think that I can wait, a thousand

2
00:00:03,366 --> 00:00:07,040
years, for my money to mature to a million dollars. What if the invention of

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,725
self driving cars, changes the economy so completely, that interest rates go up

4
00:00:10,725 --> 00:00:15,660
to 10%. How long would it take to get to 1 billion then, starting with 100?

5
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:18,492
Start with the same code that you started with last time, and modify the

6
00:00:18,492 --> 00:00:22,019
program, this time, so that, you change the interest rate.
