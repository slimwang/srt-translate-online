1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:01,940
Okay, there's a lot of code here so

2
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:05,310
this was a little bit tricky, but it shouldn't have been too bad.

3
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:08,600
So, the correct answer is this one.

4
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:10,077
So, why is this one correct?

5
00:00:10,077 --> 00:00:13,330
Well, the first clue is that you're trying to change something.

6
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:19,670
You're not trying to read something, or insert something, or delete something.

7
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:21,180
You really are trying to change or

8
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:24,360
update something, so it has to be one of these two.

9
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:27,340
All right. Then the question is, what do you want to change to red?

10
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:30,430
Well, you want to change the calendars themselves.

11
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:36,312
Therefore, the correct URI is the CalendarContract.Calendars.CONTENT_URI, not

12
00:00:36,312 --> 00:00:39,150
the Events URI, which is right here.

13
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:41,340
So again, you needed two parts to do this.

14
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:43,910
First, that you're changing something, so it's update.

15
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:45,813
And then it's the calendar that you're trying to change.

16
00:00:45,813 --> 00:00:48,350
Therefore, the URI is the calendar URI.
