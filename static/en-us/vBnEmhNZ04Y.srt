1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:04,310
The apt get application is your main
interface to a ton of package related

2
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:05,600
functionality.

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:08,590
We can check out everything you
can do by reading the man page for

4
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:10,260
it with this command, man apt get.

5
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:15,520
We see here it can install packages,
it can even remove packages,

6
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:17,640
it can do all sorts of stuff.

7
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:20,400
For now, let's see if there
are some packages that are no

8
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,470
longer required that we can
just automatically remove.

9
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:25,920
We'll do this with the command
apt-get autoremove.

10
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,000
And once again, it's an administrative
task that has to be run as root.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:29,620
So we use sudo.

12
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:32,610
After a few seconds,

13
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:36,100
we're returned back to our prompt to
let us know everything is all done.

14
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:39,200
Now let's use apt-get to
install new software.

15
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,690
We'll install an application
called finger.

16
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:44,850
It's something we'll use a little bit
later on when working with users.

17
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:48,755
We do this by typing the command
apt-get install finger, and

18
00:00:48,755 --> 00:00:50,263
once again using sudo.
