1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:00,910
Hey Charles.

2
00:00:00,910 --> 00:00:02,029
>> Hey Michael, how's it going?

3
00:00:02,029 --> 00:00:03,150
>> Not too bad.

4
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:06,800
I'm very excited because today we
get to talk about TD with Control.

5
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:09,190
>> Okay,
is that what that yellow thing is?

6
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:10,630
>> That's intended to
be a lightning bolt.

7
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:13,500
I don't know, somehow it just
convergence, TD with Control,

8
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,230
it sounded like a superhero movie to me.

9
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:16,030
>> Okay.

10
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:17,360
That makes perfect sense.

11
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:18,450
Why are you excited about this?

12
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:22,017
>> Well so, what we are going to talk
about is how to not just learn values

13
00:00:22,017 --> 00:00:25,461
learning update rules like TD, but
to actually learn the values of

14
00:00:25,461 --> 00:00:29,780
different actions we might take as a way
of figuring out the right way to behave.

15
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:30,528
>> Okay.
I like that.

16
00:00:30,528 --> 00:00:31,137
>> Yeah.
And

17
00:00:31,137 --> 00:00:35,647
we'll even get really close to
proving that these methods converge.

18
00:00:35,647 --> 00:00:38,578
That is to say that,
given enough data over enough time,

19
00:00:38,578 --> 00:00:40,570
they actually do the right thing.

20
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:41,150
>> Okay.

21
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:43,560
By the way, did you know
that Convergence is the name

22
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:48,390
of the 2015 company-wide
event in DC Comics?

23
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:48,950
>> Whoa!

24
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:50,570
Okay, so it is a superhero thing.

25
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:51,740
>> Yeah, well done.

26
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:55,450
>> Does that mean we get paid for
using their stuff, or

27
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:57,930
does that mean that we have to pay for
using their stuff?

28
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:01,310
>> I think it means that
we have to pay them so-

29
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:02,320
>> Oh, whoops.

30
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,080
>> Time to raise tuition.

31
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:04,780
>> Can I do that?

32
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:06,570
>> There you go,
now everything's taken care of.

33
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:07,070
>> Tada!
