1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Let's take a look at Euler's formula again.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
What we're going to do is prove by induction that this holds.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
We can build any planar graph by iteratively adding nodes and edges.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Let's start off with the simplest thing, which is just a single node. Ta-da!

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
We can start off with just the simplest graph of all--just a node sitting on the plane all by itself,

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
a lonely point, and we've got one node, no edges, and one giant region around it,

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
and 1 - 0 + 1 is indeed 2.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
That's our base case.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Now we proceed by induction.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Given that we're doing a proof by induction, we're going to assume that we have

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
some planar graph and that Euler's formula holds for that graph.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
We have already that n - m + r = 2.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
What we're going to do is we're going to add to this graph so that it's still planar

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
and see what happens to this formula.

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
There are two different ways that we can add to this graph.

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
We can add a node and an edge together, or we can add an edge between two exiting nodes.

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Let's consider this first case where we had a new node and an edge between them,

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
and it's still a planar graph. What happens to m, n, and r?

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Well, we have one new node and one new edge but the number of regions hasn't changed.

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
We're just jutting into some region inside or outside,

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
but it doesn't change the total number of regions--(n + 1) - (m + 1)--

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
these ones cancel, and we get n - m + r,

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
which by our inductive hypothesis we said is 2.

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
In that case, the formula still holds.

25
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
What about the case where we just add an edge.

26
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
One way we can add an edge is inside of some other region,

27
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
and let's look what happens in that case.

28
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The number of nodes is unchanged. The number of edges has gone up by one.

29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
But the number of regions has gone up by one as well.

30
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
This used to be one giant region, and it's now been split in to two regions.

31
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Once again, these ones cancel.

32
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Our formula still holds.

33
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Let's just double-check what happens if we do something on the outside,

34
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
sort of breaking into the huge vast region around it.

35
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Connect, say, these two nodes, what have we done?

36
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
We still have the vast region around it, but we created a new region here.

37
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Again, the number of regions has gone up by 1.

38
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Similarly, if we click this over the number of regions has gone up by 1.

39
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
If we add an edge without a corresponding node, the number of regions goes up by 1.

40
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
If we add an edge and a node together, the region stays the same,

41
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
but the number of nodes goes up by 1.

42
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
No matter what you do, this formula keeps holding. Pretty cool.
