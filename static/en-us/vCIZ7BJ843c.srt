00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,430
Let's say that the circles are laid out. So that the fields touch the sides of

2
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:07,087
the fields that they're right next to. And fields are nestled an equal distance

3
00:00:07,087 --> 00:00:11,175
from the field just above them on the left and the right. This calculation

4
00:00:11,175 --> 00:00:14,680
takes a few steps, so we'll need to go through an example by hand first.
