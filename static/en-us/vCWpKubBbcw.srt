00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:02,510
Now, we know how to measure and compare

2
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:06,530
performance. And we also know that overall performance improvement

3
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:10,090
requires a careful balance between improving one aspect of

4
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:12,750
the design and not messing up on the other

5
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:15,520
aspects of that design. We're ready now to

6
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:18,320
look at more advanced techniques for improving performance and

7
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,910
efficiency. And we will look first at pipelining, one

8
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:25,500
of the most important and generally applicable techniques in

9
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,840
a computer architects bag of tricks.
