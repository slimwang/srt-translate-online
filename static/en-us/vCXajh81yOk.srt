1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,070
Now that we've used docker to
start multiple instances Of our

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:04,330
Inganest container.

3
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:05,939
I want to show you how to
communicate with them.

4
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:09,730
What we can do is look
at the container ID

5
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:11,820
of a docker instance
using the PS command.

6
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:17,180
I'll copy the container ID and
use a docker inspect command

7
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:20,670
to find out more information
about a specific container.

8
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:23,249
From the output I can see the IP
address of the container.

9
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,130
I can then use curl to hit
the engine next instance

10
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:29,360
running inside of the container.

11
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:31,730
And there you go,
we're talking to that instance.

12
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:35,550
Now that we're done with our instances,
let's clean up.

13
00:00:36,745 --> 00:00:39,935
When we want to stop these docker
instances, we'll use the docker stop

14
00:00:39,935 --> 00:00:45,365
command with the container IDs of the
instances we want to remove, like this.

15
00:00:45,365 --> 00:00:49,485
And we'll use the docker rm command
to remove our docking containers from

16
00:00:49,485 --> 00:00:52,365
our system and
any file they may have left behind.

17
00:00:54,455 --> 00:00:58,695
And we can verify the three inganest
instances are no longer running

18
00:00:58,695 --> 00:01:00,079
using the docker ps command.

19
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:04,910
And we'll use the docker rm command to
remove our docker containers from our

20
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:08,660
system and any files that
they may have left behind.
