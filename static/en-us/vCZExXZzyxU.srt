00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,686
Our solution then is to find the factors of 2 and negative 13, so that we can

2
00:00:03,686 --> 00:00:08,622
eventually use the rational zero theorem. So, what are the positive factors of

00:00:08,622 --> 00:00:11,954
2, and what are the positive factors of negative 13?
