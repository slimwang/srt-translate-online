>> Now that you've had some practice finding equations of horizontal and

2
00:00:04,732 --> 00:00:10,088
vertical lines, let's try some other kinds of equations. For this problem I want

3
00:00:10,088 --> 00:00:15,065
you to find the equation of the line that goes through the points negative 2,

4
00:00:15,065 --> 00:00:20,001
negative 3 and 2, 7. I want you to write your answer in this box in standard

5
00:00:20,001 --> 00:00:25,786
form. Remember standard form is ax plus by equals c. Now remember you're going

6
00:00:25,786 --> 00:00:31,473
to have to find the slope between these two points before you can find the

7
00:00:31,473 --> 00:00:34,787
equation of the line. Just try your best.
