00:00:00,413 --> 00:00:03,278
To understand latency versus bandwidth with a real-world example,

2
00:00:03,278 --> 00:00:07,713
let's say my research group and I were going to drive from California to Virginia to visit Dave.

3
00:00:07,713 --> 00:00:09,986
This is 4,500 kilometers.

4
00:00:09,986 --> 00:00:12,219
Now we could either take a sports car,

5
00:00:12,219 --> 00:00:16,169
which holds 2 of us, and speed across the country at 200 kilometers an hour.

6
00:00:16,169 --> 00:00:18,593
Or we could take a bus that holds 40 of us

7
00:00:18,593 --> 00:00:20,886
but only travels at 50 kilometers per hour.

8
00:00:20,886 --> 00:00:23,193
What is the latency of each, measured in hours,

9
00:00:23,193 --> 00:00:27,000
and the throughput measured in people transported per hour?
