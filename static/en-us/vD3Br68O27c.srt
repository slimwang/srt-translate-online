1
00:00:00,267 --> 00:00:05,799
So let's investigate this a bit further. And for now, we'll be focusing on vertex cover and on independent set.

2
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:11,899
So let's say we're given a graph with N vertices, and we're looking at the smallest possible vertex cover,

3
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:16,932
so a minimum vertex cover for that graph. And for the largest possible independent set.

4
00:00:16,933 --> 00:00:22,999
So a maximum independent set. So let's say the size of the minimum vertex cover for this graph here is K,

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:31,299
so some integer smaller than N. And then--and you know this from the reduction between vertex cover and independent set--

6
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:36,866
the largest possible independent set that we can find in this graph has size N minus K.

7
00:00:36,867 --> 00:00:43,432
So now, instead of finding the smallest possible vertex cover, let's run the factor two approximation algorithm.

8
00:00:43,433 --> 00:00:52,299
And that algorithm will give us some number, and that number is guaranteed to be less than or equal to 2k.

9
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:56,932
And what that means for the independent set, of course, is if we take those N vertices here

10
00:00:56,933 --> 00:01:04,399
and take away those 2k vertices, then of course we still arrive at an independent set, and that independent set has a size of

11
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:11,199
at least N minus 2k. Because the size of the vertex cover and of the independent set always add up to N.

12
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:17,899
So this here would be the optimum solution, and this here would be what the vertex cover factor two approximation finds.

13
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:23,732
So what about the approximation factor? So you already know that for vertex cover we have a factor two approximation.

14
00:01:23,733 --> 00:01:29,999
And the way you arrive at the two is, of course, since this is a minimization problem, you take what the approximation finds

15
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,732
and divide it by the size of the optimum solution. So it's basically 2k over k, and that's equal to two.

16
00:01:37,733 --> 00:01:42,366
Now, what about independent set? So, independent set is a maximization problem.

17
00:01:42,367 --> 00:01:49,366
So, for vertex cover, we took what the algorithm finds and divided it by the size of the optimum solution.

18
00:01:49,367 --> 00:01:55,832
But that was because it was a minimization problem. For a maximization problem, given how we define approximation factors,

19
00:01:55,833 --> 00:02:02,932
we'll have to do it just the other way around. So the approximation factor here is the size of the optimum solution

20
00:02:02,933 --> 00:02:13,066
divided by what the approximation actually finds. So it's divided by N minus 2k, which is equal to one plus K over N minus 2k.

21
00:02:13,067 --> 00:02:23,132
So the factor two approximation algorithm for vertex cover is actually a factor one plus K over N minus 2k

22
00:02:23,133 --> 00:02:25,800
approximation algorithm for independent set.
