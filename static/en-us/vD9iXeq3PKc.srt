00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:03,994
Hopefully these last two examples illustrated the concept of type I and type II

2
00:00:03,994 --> 00:00:08,490
errors. But now to wrap up this lesson, let's apply type I and type II errors

3
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:13,820
to the question of whether or not a musical lesson will increase engagement.

4
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:18,293
Remember that our population parameter was 7.47 and this is from the actual

5
00:00:18,293 --> 00:00:24,640
responses from the survey that I sent out. And the actual population standard

6
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:30,112
deviation was 2.41. Our new hypothesis, then, will be that the new population

7
00:00:30,112 --> 00:00:34,626
mean after the intervention will not have a significant change from this

8
00:00:34,626 --> 00:00:40,427
population parameter. In other words, there won't be a treatment effect. And

9
00:00:40,427 --> 00:00:44,606
the alternative hypothesis is that there is a treatment effect. So the two

10
00:00:44,606 --> 00:00:49,828
parameters will be significantly different. Now let's say that we have a sample

11
00:00:49,828 --> 00:00:54,692
of size 30, and the mean engagement is 8.3, however the true engagement of the

12
00:00:54,692 --> 00:01:02,100
population if we were to implement this musical lesson, will be 7.8. Now in

13
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:07,252
real life we don't know what muse sub song will be but let's pretend we do. If

14
00:01:07,252 --> 00:01:12,268
this happens, then which of these four quadrants represents the results of our

15
00:01:12,268 --> 00:01:17,128
hypothesis test? This is a pretty tough question and it requires you to

16
00:01:17,128 --> 00:01:20,548
remember what we did before and then really understand Type I and Type II

17
00:01:20,548 --> 00:01:26,256
errors. Give it your best shot. Let's say our alpha level is 0.05 and this is

18
00:01:26,256 --> 00:01:28,411
for a two-tailed test.
