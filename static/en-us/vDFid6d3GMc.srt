00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,230
The first step to learning Ember is
to understand how routing works.

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:05,590
When an Ember app is loaded,

3
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:08,530
the router's job is to match
the URL against the list of routes.

4
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:12,880
When it finds a route,
it loads that route's route file and

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,930
renders the associated template.

6
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:17,670
Right now the base route loads
the application template, but

7
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:20,730
we can add to the list of
routes that Ember manages.

8
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:23,600
We can add a menu route that
loads the menu template.

9
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,260
Now, menu here and
menu here don't have to be the same.

10
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:31,700
This is what's matched against the URL,
and this is the name of the template.

11
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:34,990
We could just have easily have named
the template something like food.

12
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:38,190
So we have our application view and
we can display our list of menu items,

13
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:41,630
but we want to be able to
view just one item at a time.

14
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:42,332
There we go.
Now,

15
00:00:42,332 --> 00:00:45,760
/item/strawberry-pudding will
use the item template.

16
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:50,820
That was easy, except what about when
we want to view the chicken salad?

17
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:54,900
We don't want to create a route and
template for every single menu item.

18
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:57,720
We can use Ember to make
URL matching dynamic.

19
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:00,830
Instead of listing each route
to look for, we can do this.

20
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:02,810
Ember calls this a dynamic segment and

21
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:06,140
will match anything between
this slash and the next one.

22
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:10,240
So the router captures the dynamic
segment and passes it to the item route.

23
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,179
A route file is where you put
the business logic for a template.

24
00:01:13,179 --> 00:01:15,747
The template is then rendered
with data from the route file.

25
00:01:15,747 --> 00:01:16,350
Awesome.
