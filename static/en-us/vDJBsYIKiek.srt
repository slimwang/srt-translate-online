Let's consider a new function. We have f of x equals x minus six, times x plus

2
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:10,570
two, times x minus four. I'd like to discuss how to evaluate this function and

3
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:14,693
a few very special points. And this is going to help us figure out how to

4
00:00:14,693 --> 00:00:19,324
factor polynomials better. So if we consider this function, then what do we get

5
00:00:19,324 --> 00:00:23,323
for f of four? And what do we get for f of negative two?
