00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:05,480
Hypothesis testing about the true population correlation is a type of t test.

2
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:08,720
It uses the t distribution, and therefore, the t table that we discussed

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:14,055
earlier. This is the formula, but you don't need to use it. And the degrees of

4
00:00:14,055 --> 00:00:19,895
freedom are N minus 2. You can understand this intuitively because we have n

5
00:00:19,895 --> 00:00:25,922
values, n for each variable, and we subtract 1 per group. We just wanted to

6
00:00:25,922 --> 00:00:29,518
show you this so that you see what it is, but in real life you'll use software

7
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:34,239
to run this test. The important thing is that you're able to interpret it, and

8
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:37,167
since you already know all about t tests, you know when to reject or fail to

9
00:00:37,167 --> 00:00:42,114
reject the null. For example, let's say we're measuring the relationship

10
00:00:42,114 --> 00:00:48,312
between two variables. And we have 25 participants. And let's say we do a

11
00:00:48,312 --> 00:00:54,962
non-directional test at alpha equals 0.05. Let's say we get a t statistic equal

12
00:00:54,962 --> 00:01:01,506
to 2.71. What do we conclude there is or there is not enough evidence to reject

13
00:01:01,506 --> 00:01:09,650
the null because there is or is not a significant relationship between x and y.
