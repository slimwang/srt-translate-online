00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,290
Congratulations, you've
finished the course.

2
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:08,020
You've learned the fundamental skills
needed to build a progressive web app.

3
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:12,250
And you've put those skills to
use by building one of your own.

4
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:17,230
Progressive web apps are web apps
that took all the right vitamins.

5
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:20,630
They combine the best of the web and
the best of the apps.

6
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:25,220
And give users the kind of reliable,
fast, and engaging experience

7
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:30,170
that they've come to expect from native
apps but delivered through the web.

8
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:34,320
So go, use your new found skills and
build something awesome.
