00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,272
All right. Now that quote's explained, why we want to use a more traditional

2
00:00:05,284 --> 00:00:10,677
object-oriented class base set up, let's go ahead and do that. Now, we'll be

3
00:00:10,689 --> 00:00:16,090
using a piece of code by John Resig that fakes class-based object oriented

4
00:00:16,102 --> 00:00:20,745
programming. Feel free to take a look at the code or the linked blog below to

5
00:00:20,757 --> 00:00:25,241
see how it works. Now, we're not terribly interested in the internals for our

6
00:00:25,253 --> 00:00:29,520
purposes. What we care about is how to use it for instantiating the proper

7
00:00:29,532 --> 00:00:34,029
class-based inheritance trees for our game objects. So, let's say we want to

8
00:00:34,041 --> 00:00:39,071
create the following inheritance tree. We want weapon and entity to both inherit

9
00:00:39,083 --> 00:00:43,843
from Class. And we want MachineGun and ChainGun to inherit from Weapon. And

10
00:00:43,855 --> 00:00:48,747
Teleporter and EnergyCanister to inherit from entity. Now we've started this off

11
00:00:48,759 --> 00:00:53,385
for you, but we're going to have you complete this yourself. First, we set

12
00:00:53,397 --> 00:00:59,053
weapon to be Class.extend. What this means is that weapon extends all of Class's

13
00:00:59,065 --> 00:01:04,509
functionality, whatever that happens to be, and then adds it's own on top of it.

14
00:01:04,625 --> 00:01:09,969
Similarly, MachineGun is set to weapon.extend, which extends all of weapon's

15
00:01:10,122 --> 00:01:15,089
functionality, and then builds on top of that. Now, we've created these for you

16
00:01:15,101 --> 00:01:19,265
for a template. And, what I'd like you to do is fill in the rest of the

17
00:01:19,277 --> 00:01:21,529
inheritance tree we discussed above.
