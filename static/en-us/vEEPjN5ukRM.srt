00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:02,730
If the account api
methods look familiar,

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:06,230
you've used two of them
already in the onClick event.

3
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:08,460
Take a look at this sign_out_button, and

4
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:12,090
on the sign_out_button,
you've cleared the default account.

5
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:15,840
Whereas on the revoke_access_button,
you've used the revoke access and

6
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:17,360
disconnect method.

7
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:20,152
So you've used clearDefaultAccount
from the AccountApi,

8
00:00:20,152 --> 00:00:23,171
you've used revokeAccessAndDisconnect
from the account API.

9
00:00:23,171 --> 00:00:27,250
There's one method you haven't used yet
and that's the Get Account Name.

10
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:28,600
Lets take a look at that next.
