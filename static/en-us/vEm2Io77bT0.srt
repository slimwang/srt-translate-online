Let's start with the ones that we already know. We've seen the getMonth method

00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:07,689
before, it's part of the day class. Looks like addDays is also part of that day

3
00:00:07,689 --> 00:00:11,250
class we've been using. This length method you maybe haven't seen yet, but I

00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:14,740
can look in front of it and I can see hello world, which I know is a string.

00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:19,520
And down here, I've got something called lolcatsPic. And it's drawing, which

00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,640
sounds sort of like methods which should go with a picture.
