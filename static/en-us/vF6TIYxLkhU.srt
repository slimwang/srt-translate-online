1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,469
Here you see the composition
of these adopters.

2
00:00:03,469 --> 00:00:07,660
As you might expect, younger providers
are more likely to adopt but

3
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:10,010
the difference isn't striking.

4
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:13,950
What is striking and
has been in all prior studies,

5
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:18,730
is the difficulty smaller
practices have in adopting.

6
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:22,090
Presumably due to the lack of financial
as well as technical resources,

7
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:26,290
since many of these are in rural,
poor, under served areas.

8
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:31,630
ONC funded a special Regional Extension
Center Program to provide special help

9
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:33,340
to these providers.

10
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:37,630
Note, as well, that practice ownership
can be a significant factor.
