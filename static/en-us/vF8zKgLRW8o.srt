I think the most important thing to do when you encounter an error is to take a

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:07,140
step back and breathe for a second. Usually it's some small inane thing, so I

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:10,370
try to look back through whatever part seems to be compiling incorrectly or

4
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:14,470
running incorrectly. And determining if I've, you know, misnamed a variable or

5
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:17,950
done something really small or inane and usually it's that. If it's not then I

6
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:21,510
like to proceed through the code line by line. And just sort of look at what

7
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:25,630
every variable is assigned to, and what, what's happening in each line in the

8
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:29,680
code. And usually by going step by step and slowly, I'll find the error pretty

9
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:30,130
quickly.
