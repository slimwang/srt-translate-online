1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,230
Why you're doing all this is to define the minimum viable product,

2
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:09,840
or sometimes called the MVP for short.

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:17,280
The MVP basically is what product or service you're building in your first instance

4
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:19,410
that's delivered to customers.

5
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:24,740
And the MVP is not an alpha or beta. This is a big idea.

6
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:28,460
In the old days, the product development process would go from seed funding

7
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:33,690
to concept to a market requirements document to an engineering requirements document

8
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:37,340
and blow out into an entire waterfall development process.

9
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:41,060
And part of those steps were alpha test, beta test, and first customer ship,

10
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:45,450
and you'd be shipping and telling customers, "Here's a buggy, unfinished product."

11
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:47,590
"Why don't you test it for me?"

12
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:51,490
And then you'd always argue with sales about whether you should charge for it or not.

13
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:54,100
But the MVP is actually quite different.

14
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:58,800
The MVP says, "No, no, no. We're not spec'ing a version 1.0 product

15
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,650
"that has a spec 18 pages long."

16
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:04,330
"We're actually doing the work outside the building first

17
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:09,230
"and trying to understand what's the minimum version of a version 1.0--

18
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:11,790
"not what engineering or the founders thought

19
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:16,100
"but what is it customers are going to tell us they'll pay for or use now?"

20
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:18,660
And while it might be, quote, a beta product,

21
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:20,670
we never use that word.

22
00:01:20,670 --> 99:59:59,999
We actually tell customers it's a minimum viable product.
