The final topic in this unit is called hierarchical planning.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
The idea here is we want to close the abstraction gap. What do I mean by that?

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Well, let's think about what you have to do to plan your own lifetime.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
You live about maybe a couple of billion seconds,

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
and during that time you have a choice of actions to make,

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
and you have maybe around 1,000 muscles,

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
which you can operate maybe around 10 per second.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
You end up at a lifetime as somewhere around 10^13 actions

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
give or take an order of magnitude or two.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
But there's a big gap between 10^13 and the 10^4 or so actions

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
that current planning algorithms or programs can deal with.

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Part of the problem with such a big gap is that it's just difficult to deal at the level of an individual muscle movement.

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
We'd rather deal with more abstract plans.

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
We're going to introduce the notion of a hierarchical task network,

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
and rather than having a plan be a sequence of individual steps,

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
we can talk about higher order steps where maybe there's a smaller number,

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
and the individual steps can correspond to multiple steps.

18
00:01:22,000 --> 99:59:59,999
This idea is called refinement planning.
