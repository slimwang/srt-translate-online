1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:03,220
Game engines are not really libraries.

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:06,500
They're more properly
classified as frameworks.

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:09,930
And frameworks have this important
concept of inversion of control.

4
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:12,680
When you're using libraries,

5
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:16,230
you've got your code that
is doing most of the work.

6
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:19,790
However, you have a couple of places
where you're going to need some help.

7
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:23,440
So you plug in a couple different
libraries, your code's running along.

8
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:26,280
You call into one of the libraries for
help with something specific,

9
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:28,510
like drawing or playing a sound.

10
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:32,080
And then your code resumes control and
keeps doing what it's doing.

11
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:32,890
On the other hand,

12
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:37,590
when you're using a framework,
the framework is doing most of the work.

13
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:41,550
And then has one particular place
where you insert your code.

14
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:44,470
So, the framework is going along,
allocating resources,

15
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:46,060
determining when things get called.

16
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:49,580
And then, eventually, when it's time for
your application-specific logic,

17
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:52,980
the framework calls into your
code to do something and then,

18
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:55,670
your code returns control
back to the framework.

19
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:57,440
This is called inversion of control.

20
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,220
Or, more colloquially,
The Hollywood Principle.

21
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:03,410
>> Fantastic audition, kid.

22
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:04,230
You're a real talent,

23
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:08,650
you're going to be a star, so
I'll call you when we gotta roll.

24
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:12,510
No, no, you don't call us, we call you.

25
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:15,980
>> For instance, the game engine
handles stuff like starting up the app,

26
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:19,520
setting up a place to draw,
allocating various resources.

27
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:24,120
And then only when it's finally time to
draw a frame of the game, then it calls

28
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:28,560
your code to provide the game specific
logic needed to draw that frame.

29
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,060
When you're done drawing, you return
control back to the framework.
