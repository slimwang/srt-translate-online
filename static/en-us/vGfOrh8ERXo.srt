00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
[Male narrator] Here are the answers.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
For P and P implies Q, we know that P is true

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
in these bottom 2 cases, and P implies Q, we saw the truth table for P implies Q

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
is true in the first, second, and fourth case.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:28,000
So the only case that's true for both P and P implies Q is the fourth case.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Now, this formula, not the quantity, not P or not Q, can work that out to be the same

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:46,000
as P and Q, and we know that P and Q is true only when both are true,

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
so that would be true only in the fourth case and none of the other cases.

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,000
And now, we're asking for an equivalent or biconditional between these 2 cases.

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Is this one the same as this one?

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
And we see that it is the same because they match up in all 4 cases.

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
They're false for each of the first 3 and true in the fourth one,

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
so that means that this is going to be true no matter what.

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
They're always equivalent, either both false or both true,

15
00:01:15,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and so we should check all 4 boxes.
