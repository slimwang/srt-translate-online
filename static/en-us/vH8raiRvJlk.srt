00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:05,980
So far in this course I've been treating
addresses as if they belong to hosts.

2
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:11,030
Well, they kind of do, but
it's more accurate to say

3
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:16,280
that addresses don't belong to hosts so
much as they belong to interfaces.

4
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:22,150
A host, like this laptop,
can have multiple network interfaces and

5
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:25,370
each interface can have zero or
more addresses.

6
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:30,870
For example, this laptop might have
a wired Ethernet interface and

7
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:34,950
a WiFi interface, and
every machine also has a loop

8
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:37,779
back interface which can be used for
talking to itself.

9
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:41,860
And there are other kinds
of interfaces as well, for

10
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:45,150
example you might have a tunnel
to another part of the network.

11
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:49,570
Or if you bring up a VM on a system,
like Virtual box for instance,

12
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:52,860
there can be a virtual machine interface
connecting the host operating system and

13
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:54,020
the guest operating system.

14
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:59,100
And on Linux you can find out
what interfaces your machine has

15
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,610
with the command ip addr show.

16
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:07,560
In this case showing that this
machine has a loopback interface and

17
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:14,670
eth0 interface, lo and eth0, and
here are their IPv4 addresses.

18
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:16,440
There are other commands
that can do this as well.

19
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:22,590
For instance on a Mac or other Unix
system, might use the ifconfig command.

20
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:27,280
And on Mac OS 10 you'll
find that a system has

21
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,980
an awful lot of interfaces,
many of which aren't used for

22
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:33,730
Internet traffic but for
other things like finding printers.

23
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:38,490
You can compare the addresses you see
here against your network configuration

24
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:41,009
in the GUI to find out what
interface you're actually using.

25
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:45,380
A little bit more about
that LOOPBACK interface.

26
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:50,330
The LOOPBACK is a special interface
that almost always has the IP

27
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:55,015
address 127.0.0.1 and
the host name localhost and allows

28
00:01:55,015 --> 00:01:59,155
programs to use the network stack to
talk to other programs on the same host.

29
00:01:59,155 --> 00:02:02,175
Whenever you've made connections
to local host or 127.0.0.1 before,

30
00:02:02,175 --> 00:02:07,175
those are going over
the loopback interface.
