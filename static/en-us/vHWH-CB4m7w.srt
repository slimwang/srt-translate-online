1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,790
When we talk about Virtualization.

2
00:00:01,790 --> 00:00:04,820
When we look at CPUs in memory.

3
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:08,360
Certain things are relatively
less complicated,

4
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:11,080
in spite of everything that we said,
so far.

5
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:15,000
Because there is a significant
level of standardization

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,390
at the instruction set architecture,
across different platforms.

7
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:21,620
So then from
a Virtualization standpoint,

8
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:26,310
we know that we have to
support a specific ISA.

9
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:29,430
And then we don't care if there
are lower level differences

10
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:33,630
between the hardware because it's up
to the hardware manufacturers to be

11
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:35,660
standardized at the ISA level.

12
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:40,545
This clearly is the case for
a particular ISA for instance, for

13
00:00:40,545 --> 00:00:46,230
x86 things will be different across
x86 and for instance MIPS platforms.

14
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:50,910
When we look at devices however,
there is a much greater diversity in

15
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:56,320
the types of devices, if we compare that
to the types of CPU instruction sets.

16
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,390
And also there is lack of
standardization when it comes to

17
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:05,280
the specifics of the device interface
and the semantics of that interface,

18
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,060
so what is the behaviour when
a particular call is invoked.

19
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:13,710
How a particular device
should respond to

20
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:16,230
a call to send the packet for instance.

21
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:20,320
To deal with this diversity,
Virtualization solutions adopt

22
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:24,780
one of three key models,
to virtualize devices.

23
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,760
We will describe these models, next.

24
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:31,180
And note that they were developed
before any Virtualization friendly

25
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:36,430
hardware extensions were made to the,
CP architectures and the chip sets.

26
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:39,820
And these new modifications
of the hardware

27
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:44,620
make some aspects of device
Virtualization much simpler than

28
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:48,570
than what originally it was when
these models were first introduced.
