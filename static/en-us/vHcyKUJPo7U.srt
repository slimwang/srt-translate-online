1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,659
Here we are back at
the Firebase console.

2
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:05,960
I'm going to over to the Auth tab and
see what it shows us.

3
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:09,269
This page is telling me that
we can authenticate and

4
00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:13,219
manage users from a variety of
providers without any server side code.

5
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:14,970
So it look like we're
in the right place.

6
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:18,039
I'm going to go ahead and click on
SET UP SIGN-IN METHOD Sign-In Method..

7
00:00:18,039 --> 00:00:21,219
Here are the different authentication
options that Firebase provides.

8
00:00:21,219 --> 00:00:23,579
By default,
all of these options are disabled.

9
00:00:23,579 --> 00:00:24,489
That's no good.

10
00:00:24,489 --> 00:00:25,899
Let's enable some of these.

11
00:00:25,899 --> 00:00:30,101
For FriendlyChat, we're going to enable
a simple email password login and

12
00:00:30,102 --> 00:00:31,032
a Google login.

13
00:00:31,032 --> 00:00:34,317
So I'm going to click on email
password > enable > save it, and

14
00:00:34,317 --> 00:00:36,309
the same with Google.

15
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:38,080
And now they're enabled in Firebase.

16
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:40,129
That's everything we need
to do on the console.

17
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:41,920
Let's move on to implementing
the upside code.
