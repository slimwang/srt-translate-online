00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,834
What did you come up with for your answers? Hopefully, you had zero major

2
00:00:04,834 --> 00:00:10,067
decisions that you had to make today. As for the number of minor decisions, I

3
00:00:10,067 --> 00:00:16,149
started counting and lost track well after 35. In addition to decisions, we

4
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:20,770
also have judgments that we make throughout the day. So when we say things

5
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:23,820
like, it is unlikely, or chances are, or even I decided, we are judging how

6
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:29,410
likely something is to happen. That is, its probability.
