1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,510
The solution for
this is that in cycle 13,

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:06,800
we have already issued all the
instructions so no issue will happen.

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:10,030
We have already begun execution
of all these instructions,

4
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:13,932
so the correct answer obviously, will
not be that something else executes in

5
00:00:13,932 --> 00:00:16,590
13 because we have
already begun execution.

6
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:18,770
We have already seen that
this begin executing in 13.

7
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:20,320
But, that's not the question.

8
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,140
The writing of the results, neither of
this can write the result in 13, and

9
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,610
all the other results have
already been written.

10
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:30,480
For commit however,
this result has been written in 12.

11
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,830
This is the very first instruction
that we are going to try to commit, so

12
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:38,090
this instruction will
actually commit in cycle 13.

13
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:40,940
So the correct answer is C for

14
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:44,990
commit, one because this is
the instruction that commits.

15
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:48,994
So this is also what
happens in cycle 13.
