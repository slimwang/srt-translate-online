1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,430
Let's think about these dice values for
a second.

2
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:06,770
Even though they were displayed
in the dice to controller.

3
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:10,520
They were actually generated
by the RollViewController.

4
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:13,930
It is usually necessary for
a presenting controller to configure or

5
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:16,390
pass data to a new view controller.

6
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:19,910
We are about to learn two more ways
to use storyboard to present view

7
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:21,630
controllers using segues.

8
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:24,490
Each of the three ways finds
a slightly different strategy for

9
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:27,050
passing information from one
View Controller to the next.

10
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:32,439
Of the four view controllers that we've
presented so far, which ones required

11
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:35,950
the presenting controller to provide
information to the new view controller?
