1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,730
So now what we're interested in asking
the question, given an image like this,

2
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:06,430
how do we transform it
to an image like this?

3
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:07,810
Again, here I'm basically showing

4
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:10,110
a little bit of scaling
in one direction only.

5
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:14,720
Let's start off by basically finding
two points on my original image, f.

6
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:16,140
This is my original image f.

7
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:18,230
And I'm trying to get my output image g.

8
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:21,720
Here, I basically have two
points that I've kind of marked.

9
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:25,909
Of course, what we're now interested is
seeing where these two points would be

10
00:00:25,909 --> 00:00:26,731
on this image.

11
00:00:26,731 --> 00:00:28,693
Where would they transform to?

12
00:00:28,693 --> 00:00:30,772
So, call this one P1.

13
00:00:30,772 --> 00:00:35,420
And we call this image,
or point here, P2.

14
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:40,340
This P1 and P2 have now moved
to different points here.

15
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:44,230
So of course this is now
all these two points.

16
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:48,510
And just for sake of parity we
will call this P2 prime, and

17
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:51,990
then we will call this P1 prime.

18
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:55,390
In essence, now what we have to
figure out is how to transform

19
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:57,050
the point P to P prime.

20
00:00:57,050 --> 00:01:00,570
So in essence, what we need now is the
simple function that takes any point,

21
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:04,200
P, of course in this case, in this case,
they would have values of x and

22
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:07,000
y to generate a new point, P prime.

23
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,740
In this case, we want to find one
function, T, which has a set of

24
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:15,840
parameters that actually applies this
thing entirely to the whole image.

25
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,380
So in this case,
I'm basically talking about one function

26
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:21,160
that directly applies to each and
every pixel.

27
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:23,790
This basically means that
this would be a global warp.

28
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:25,030
Every, the same function,

29
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:27,950
the same parameter function would
be applied to the entire image.

30
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:31,450
So in essence, what we're talking
about is ,a global function,

31
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:34,310
that given a P,
we would always get a P prime.

32
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:36,870
And just to reiterate,
what basically I'm talking about is,

33
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:39,910
I want to come up with a few
set of simple parameters.

34
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:42,700
So by now, you've noticed I like to
convert everything to matrices because

35
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:45,360
that's a great representation for
us to be playing around with.

36
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,000
And, of course, this is true here.

37
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,020
What we really want to
do is find a matrix

38
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:52,210
that encodes all of
the transformation or

39
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:55,740
the parameters, and then when applied
it to point p, and again, remember,

40
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:59,450
this would be just simple x and
y, to generate a new x and y.

41
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:02,510
Basically, this is the simple
two-dimensional transformation

42
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:03,520
we're looking at.

43
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,780
Given a matrix M, that has certain set
of parameters, when applied to point

44
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:11,600
x and y, any variable in this f
function, which is my first one,

45
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:15,960
I would get an output, g, which would
have all x primes, and y primes.

46
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,130
So, by just looking at this,

47
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:20,762
you may note that this M should be two,
a two by two matrix, and

48
00:02:20,762 --> 00:02:24,470
now we, let's start to figure out what
would be in this two by two matrix.
