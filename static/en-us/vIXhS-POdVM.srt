1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:04,350
This is all well and good if our numbers work out nicely. But what if we don't

2
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:09,295
have numbers that are as pretty as these? That work this easily together. Let's

3
00:00:09,295 --> 00:00:14,000
stick with 4 to the x. But how about on the right hand side of the equation, we

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,241
put something different, like 121. Now, this problem is not as simple as the

5
00:00:19,241 --> 00:00:24,482
last 2 .We can't easily make 121 into a power of 4. So I think we need to go

6
00:00:24,482 --> 00:00:29,271
back to our knowledge of properties. In particular, properties of exponents and

7
00:00:29,271 --> 00:00:34,050
logs. We have some one-to-one properties. There's this one that we just talked

8
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:38,172
about. If we know that A to the x equals A to the y, then we also know that x

9
00:00:38,172 --> 00:00:44,038
equals y. And similarly, we have this second one. If we know that log base A of

10
00:00:44,038 --> 00:00:49,870
x is equal to log base A o fy, then we also know that x equals y. We also have

11
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:54,215
some inverse properties. Properties that demonstrate that exponential and

12
00:00:54,215 --> 00:00:59,156
logarithmic functions are each other's inverses. The first one is that a to the

13
00:00:59,156 --> 00:01:05,385
power of log base a of x is equal to x. Here's the first one. a to the power of

14
00:01:05,385 --> 00:01:11,150
log base a of x equals x. And the second one says that log base a of a to the x

15
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:17,160
is equal to x. This is just showing that logs and exponents undo one another.

16
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,966
Now, keeping these in mind, let's go back to that equation we were working

17
00:01:19,966 --> 00:01:26,334
with. And here it is again. 4 to the x equals 121. Now as we did in earlier

18
00:01:26,334 --> 00:01:29,694
lessons, I think we should take the log of both sides, after all we want to

19
00:01:29,694 --> 00:01:35,212
extract the x from the exponent here. One of those two inverse properties was

20
00:01:35,212 --> 00:01:39,052
this one, that if we have something like a to the x, just as we do here, if we

21
00:01:39,052 --> 00:01:45,850
take log base a of that we'll just end up with x on this side of the equation.

22
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:49,744
That sounds pretty good to me. So thinking about the equation that we have,

23
00:01:49,744 --> 00:01:54,320
what base should the log that we apply to both sides be? In other words, what

24
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,009
should a here equal?
