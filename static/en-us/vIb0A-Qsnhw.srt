1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
The answer is 18/31, which is approximately 0.5806.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
4/31 is 0.1290,

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
and 9/31, which is half of the thing over here, 0.2903.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
And again, we look at the same as before.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
We look at the total nonnormalized measurement probabilities for our particles.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:32,000
In a white square, the probability of seeing white is 1 - 0.1, that is 0.9.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Since we have 2 particles, the nonnormalized cumulative particle weight is 1.8.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Doing the same for the black square, the probability of seeing white is 0.2,

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
which is 1 - 0.8.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,000
We have 2 particles in the black square to get a nonnormalized total probability

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
of 0.4, so you get a nonnormalized total importance weight of 0.4.

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:04,000
And finally, the probability of seeing white in the white square is 1 - 0.1 is 0.9,

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
and here we only have 1 particle, so the nonnormalized importance weight is 0.9.

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
If you add those up, we get 3.1.

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
So we have to divide all of those by 3.1.

16
00:01:15,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So 18/31 is the 1st one. 4 by 31--the 2nd, and 9 by 31--the 3rd, as indicated on the left.
