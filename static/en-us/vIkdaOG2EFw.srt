>> Now that we've rewritten this as a compound inequality, we know how to solve

2
00:00:03,792 --> 00:00:07,489
for x. So please isolate x by doing the same thing to all three sections at

3
00:00:07,489 --> 00:00:11,387
once. Then write your answer in these three boxes. I have been really nice, and

4
00:00:11,387 --> 00:00:15,155
I've already filled in your inequality signs for you. So you just have to fill

5
00:00:15,155 --> 00:00:17,294
in the quantities that go in between them.
