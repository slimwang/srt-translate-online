00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:05,500
Since a digital image is sampled at
discrete locations in space, it can

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:10,480
be written down as a two-dimensional
array or matrix of values.

3
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:13,050
Here is an example.

4
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:16,280
Note that this matrix
has fractional values,

5
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:18,910
both positive as well as negative.

6
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:24,380
But what if we could only represent
a small set of integer values,

7
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:26,550
say between 0 and 5?

8
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:29,295
How would you quantize this matrix so

9
00:00:29,295 --> 00:00:34,595
that the result consists of
only the integers 0 through 5?

10
00:00:34,595 --> 00:00:38,565
Enter the converted values
in the corresponding boxes.

11
00:00:38,565 --> 00:00:40,523
Assume that we always round down.

12
00:00:40,523 --> 00:00:44,275
For example, 1.8 becomes 1.

13
00:00:44,275 --> 00:00:47,130
Also, be careful about the limits.

14
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:51,720
Anything less than the lower limit 0,
should be converted to 0, and

15
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:57,264
anything greater than the upper limit 5,
should be converted to 5.
