1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,500
So, let's think about what we want lookup to do. It's going

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:05,260
to take a hash table and a word, its output is going to

3
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:09,750
be the value associated with that keyword. What we want lookup to

4
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:12,900
do is, like add, first thing it has to do is find the

5
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:14,440
right bucket, and we've defined this

6
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:16,520
procedure hashtable_get_bucket to make it easy

7
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:18,780
to do that. Once we've found the bucket, what we want to do

8
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:21,750
for lookup is go through all the entries in that bucket. See

9
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:25,430
if there's one where the key of that entry matches the word that

10
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:28,549
we're passing in. So, your goals to define a procedure,

11
00:00:28,549 --> 00:00:32,210
we call it hashtable_lookup. It takes two inputs, a hashtable,

12
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:36,950
and a key, which is the string, and it outputs the

13
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:40,440
value associated with that key. Whenever you're asked to define a

14
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:45,260
procedure, you should think carefully whether the description is clear enough.

15
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:48,470
In this case it's not. There's a situation that this description

16
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:51,320
doesn't cover. We need to think about the case where the

17
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,950
key is not actually in the table. What should we do

18
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:56,400
then? There's a lot of different things we could do. We

19
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,430
could produce an error. The problem with producing an error is then

20
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:02,210
we've got to deal with it when we call it. We'd like to, instead, produce the

21
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:05,120
value that we can use to represent the

22
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:08,150
case where there's no entry associated with that key.

23
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:12,360
And we'll use the None value for that. So, if the key is not in the

24
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:15,740
table, the result of lookup should be None,

25
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:18,020
which means there's no value associated with that key.
