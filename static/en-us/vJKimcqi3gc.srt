00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
In answering how many people we actually need to poll, we made an assumption.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
And the assumption more or less is that small changes in p don't matter.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,000
So we don't have to worry about getting it exactly right if we're trying to estimate a sample size.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:26,000
To prove this to ourselves, let's redo this calculation with p = 0.5 and p = 0.6.

00:00:26,000 --> 99:59:59,999
