00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,780
In the next few sections,

2
00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:05,980
I'll be covering how you'll create your
very first prototype within InVision.

3
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:09,220
By combining the core aspects of speed,
interactivity, and

4
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:12,660
remote feedback, you'll see how your
static images can be brought to life

5
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:13,690
through the InVision platform.

6
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:19,499
The five steps we'll go through
are create an invisionapp.com account,

7
00:00:19,499 --> 00:00:23,910
create your project and
select a device type, upload your Wires,

8
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:27,960
JPGS, or PNGs into the project via
drag-n-drop, browse, InVision Sync.

9
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:30,980
Link your screens together, and

10
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:33,920
finally, how to invite
collaborators into your project.
