Okay, here is our Array List of pictures. A bunch of pictures have already been

2
00:00:04,866 --> 00:00:10,116
added and our job is to draw them all. Here is the loop that goes through all

3
00:00:10,116 --> 00:00:15,720
of the valid index values. We get the IF picture and we'll draw it. Let's see

4
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:20,832
what happens. Oh yuck. It drew them all on top of each other. I guess it makes

5
00:00:20,832 --> 00:00:25,761
sense each picture has as its top left corner 00. So I'd like you to do a

6
00:00:25,761 --> 00:00:32,420
better job with this. Draw the IF picture so that its upper left corner is 100

7
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:37,073
times i for x, and leave y at 0.
