1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The answer is 79.74.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
The way you get that is divide the 6618 by 83. How about the variance?

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
The variance is about 11.1 in approximation.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
You might remember that we can calculate that is exportation or the mean of the xÂ²

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
minus the mean of the x to the square, which I just did here.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Now, give me the standard deviation. That is 3.33, the square root of the variance.
