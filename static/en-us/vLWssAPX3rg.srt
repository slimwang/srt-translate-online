00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,210
The resulting code is much cleaner, easier to maintain, and simpler to

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:07,048
understand. We have our factory class that's been defined at top. The

3
00:00:07,048 --> 00:00:10,038
spawnEntity function still takes a string that contains the typename and the

4
00:00:10,038 --> 00:00:14,119
class definition. Which is looked up against the factory hash table that we

5
00:00:14,119 --> 00:00:18,695
previously filled in with the class. This is all used together to create a new

6
00:00:18,695 --> 00:00:22,815
instance of that entity object that's returned from spawnEntity.
