1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,680
In this case, we don't know whether
the development environment matches

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:06,910
production, but that doesn't seem
to be the cause of this trouble.

3
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:10,170
The technical problem is that new
releases aren't being tested for

4
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:11,500
performance, so

5
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:14,880
the performance problems don't get
discovered until the release is done.

6
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,310
Automation doesn't seem
to be the issue here.

7
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:21,450
But because of the lack of testing, the
business isn't correctly anticipating

8
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:24,240
when a new release will
need more server capacity.

9
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,630
That's the organizational
side of this problem.

10
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:28,740
And this last one, maybe it's true,

11
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:30,580
maybe it's not but
we don't actually know.
