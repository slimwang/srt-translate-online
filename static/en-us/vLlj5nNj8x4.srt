00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,450
Now that you know the basic layout of R Studio,

2
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:05,520
you're welcome to customize it, by going to Tools, and then

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,090
Options. From here you can choose the default directory if you'd

4
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:13,880
like. You can change formatting options for editing code, or you

5
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:17,090
can even change the font and the appearance. Here, I'm using

6
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:20,390
the tomorrow theme, but there are of course some others. You

7
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:23,080
can also make adjustments to the panes so, feel free to

8
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:25,960
play around with this to get a configuration that you like.

9
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:28,380
Now, you might not have any idea what you like first

10
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:30,830
so just wait until you play with r a bit, and

11
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:33,740
then you'll find a configuration that suits you. I'm going to

12
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:37,180
leave this as is. Alright, we've got R set up, so

13
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:40,410
let's start using the programming language. To get started, I want

14
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:43,680
you to download the R script from the instructor notes and

15
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,480
open it here. When you open the file, it should look

16
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,960
like this. This R script contains both comments as plain text and

17
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,150
R code. You can run R commands by highlighting a chunk of

18
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:58,030
the code and then hitting Cmd and Enter on a Mac, Or Ctrl+Enter

19
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:01,440
on a PC. The lines of text that start with a hash or

20
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,830
a pound symbol are comments. There lines are plain text that we don't

21
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:08,150
want to run as R code. It's the standalone text that you really want

22
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:11,410
for the R code. Now, your task is to read through this file

23
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:14,080
and run and write code when you're prompted to do so. When you

24
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,660
get to the end of the file, you'll get to a question, and

25
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:19,250
you'll need to answer this question to move on to the next video

26
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:22,420
in this lesson. Now, if you're already familiar with R, I suggest trying

27
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:24,860
to answer the questions, and then you might want to go back to the

28
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:28,280
files to see if you missed anything. We know you learn best by

29
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:31,290
doing, so it's important that you execute and run this code as you

30
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:34,610
go, and that you make sense of the output. Any output will appear

31
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:38,070
down here in the console. I also hope that you have moments of

32
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:41,670
inspiration. So if something does come to mind I want you to code

33
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:44,490
it up and just run it in R. You won't break anything and the

34
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:47,410
worse thing that would happen would be an error message or a warning message

35
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:51,490
in this box. If you do happen to get stuck at any point post

36
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:54,790
in the discussions so that way your peers or one of the instructors can help.
