1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,150
Okay, let's begin writing code. Now, the first thing

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:07,110
I've done is created a new file called send_text.py. And

3
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:09,240
as you can see, this file is empty for now.

4
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:13,040
Then, if you go to Twilio's installation page, oh by

5
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,430
the way, this link is also available on the

6
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:19,340
instructor notes. If you scroll down on this page, you

7
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:22,110
will notice that Twilio has provided some sample code that

8
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:25,580
allows us to send text messages to our phone. Now,

9
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:27,850
I just want to run and see if this code

10
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:31,530
even works. If this program does work only then will

11
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:34,080
I try and understand how it actually sends a text

12
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:37,530
message to our phone. So, for now, all I'm going to do

13
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:40,820
is copy this code and go back to my syntax

14
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:44,360
program and paste that code. Okay, so it seems that

15
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:48,420
the code is importing Twilio. Although it is a little

16
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:50,770
different then what we have seen thus far, there is this

17
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:53,230
keyword here called from which we haven't seen

18
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:56,208
before, I will return to this later. Okay,

19
00:00:56,208 --> 00:01:01,130
if you read the next two lines in the program they talk about account sid and

20
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:05,140
authorization token. Now, these must be for Twilio

21
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:07,810
to figure out who I am. Almost like

22
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:10,390
my username and password. So, let's go to

23
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:13,020
the Twilio website and figure out these two values.
