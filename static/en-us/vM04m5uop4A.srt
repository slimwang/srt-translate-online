00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,690
We are now going to move to a class
of AI problems where it's not

2
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:05,990
as easy to find a solution.

3
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:09,630
In search, we generally have a few
correct routes and we have a few

4
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:13,540
algorithms that help us find that
route in a fairly straightforward way.

5
00:00:13,539 --> 00:00:16,500
However, in some problems
the state space is so large,

6
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:20,980
that we need other techniques to search
the space and find optimal solutions.

7
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:23,600
In this lesson we'll look
at simulated annealing,

8
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,140
one such technique to navigate
a potentially large space.

9
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:29,640
In particular,
we'll use simulated annealing

10
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,770
to solve the end queens problem,
a puzzle where we try and

11
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:37,340
setup end queens on a board in such
a way that they can't attack each other.

12
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:38,040
Let's get started.
