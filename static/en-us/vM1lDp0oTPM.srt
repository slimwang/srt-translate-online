1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:04,270
Let us again written to the center. Colorless green ideas sleep furiously. You

2
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:08,680
and I can quickly recognize, that this sentence is grammatically correct even as

3
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:13,070
it is semantically meaningless. How do we do it? Consider this mini-grammar.

4
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:17,080
This is a small subset of the English language grammar consisting of just three

5
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:21,770
simple rules. The sentence can go into a noun phrase, followed by a verb phrase.

6
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:26,120
A noun phase can be, optional adjectives, followed by a noun or a pronoun.

7
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:30,290
The square bracket here means, optional. A verb phrase, composed of a verb,

8
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:34,470
followed by optional adverb. The variables in this particular sentence,

9
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:39,530
are the words. The values we assign to them are elliptical categories like verb,

10
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:43,350
objective, noun and pronoun. If we can make a pastry for

11
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:47,690
this, that assigned values to this variables in a way that is consistent with

12
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:51,030
this grammar, then this particular sentence is grammatically correct.

13
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:55,330
Let's try to make a pastry for this sentence. A sentence can a noun phrase, or

14
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:58,250
a word phrase. So we may say, that this is a noun phrase and

15
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:01,930
this is word phrase. Of course at this particular point we do not know,

16
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:05,510
where we should make this demarcation, what should go into the noun phrase,

17
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:08,080
what should go into the word phrase? We know whether or

18
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,720
not, this demarcation is correct depending upon whether or not this noun phrase,

19
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:15,700
and word phrase meet the low level lexical categories. So let's look at

20
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:19,150
colorless green ideas. We know that a noun phrase can go into one or

21
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:23,380
more adjectives, followed by a noun or pronoun. So we can look at a lexicon, and

22
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:26,880
know that ideas are a noun, so we say that this is a noun.

23
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,280
We can look at a lexicon that tells us that colorless and

24
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,130
green are adjectives, and so colorless and green are adjectives here.

25
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:35,860
We have satisfied this part of the constraint. So I am ready for

26
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:39,700
the verb phrase, a verb phrase can be composed of a verb, followed by one or

27
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:44,910
more optional adverbs. We can look in the lexicon, and sleep is a verb, and

28
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:47,950
furiously is an adverb, so we have satisfied the constraints for

29
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:51,670
this particular part. Because we have satisfied the constraints,

30
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:54,540
we know the top level demarcation of this as a noun phrase, and

31
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:58,390
this as a verb phrase was correct. So the processing is not very top down here.

32
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:02,170
It also has a bottom up component. In this way we are able to decide,

33
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:05,310
that this particular sentence is grammatically correct because it satisfies

34
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:08,758
the constraints of [INAUDIBLE] grammar. Know that we have used knowledge of

35
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:11,930
constraints, and the matter of constraint propagation, both for

36
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:15,780
visual processing and for language processing. This sentence method is very

37
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:21,420
general purpose in doing independent. Once we have done constraint propagation,

38
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:26,090
to derive the parse tree for the sentence, then we can do additional processing.

39
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:30,090
We can use this parse tree to support semantic analysis to build

40
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:33,630
an understanding, a semantic understanding, of the sentence.

41
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:37,020
Similarly, in visual processing, once we have used the constraints for

42
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:41,270
doing line labelling. And recognize the surfaces and their orientations.

43
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:45,450
We can then go on further and recognize the object in its 3D form.
