1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:04,700
So thinking about the exercise for a second, what does adequacy mean?

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:07,689
Well, there's no abstract invariant.

3
00:00:07,689 --> 00:00:10,050
And that really means you don't have to worry about anything for

4
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:12,980
this particular property, for this exercise.

5
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:14,310
Or you can think about the in,

6
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:18,680
the abstract invariant as just being the Boolean, value, true.

7
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:22,580
If we make this simplification then the above adequacy criterion looks

8
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:24,030
like the following.

9
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:29,240
For every abstract state S, there's going to be a concrete state T.

10
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:36,090
And in that state the concrete invariance hold and

11
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:40,480
if we apply the retrieve function to that state we get back to S.

12
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,070
What this means is that we have to check for each situation we can get into,

13
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:48,590
with the abstract specification there corresponds a valid concrete one.
