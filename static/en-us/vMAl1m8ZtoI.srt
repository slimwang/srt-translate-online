1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The answer is a resounding yes.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Even more so, what I'm going to show you doesn't just apply

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
to binomial distributions with fair coins.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
It applies to almost any distribution that is sampled many, many times,

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
which is a very deep statistical result.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 99:59:59,999
I will construct for you the formula that is being used.
