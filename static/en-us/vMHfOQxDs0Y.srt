00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,550
Well as we said before, in the picture of that bottle, this last one,

2
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:07,410
a stripe on a sign, that's not actually due to a change in any of

3
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:10,420
the physics of the, the shape or the illumination.

4
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:13,360
It's actually due to a change in the reflectance function.

5
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:16,820
Okay. And we'll talk about that later when we talk about reflectance functions.

6
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:19,790
But the idea is that it, it's not part of the nature of the geometry of

7
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:21,820
the shape of the object or of the scene.

8
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:25,120
But of having to do with the, the reflected texture.

9
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:26,840
Or a reflected color
