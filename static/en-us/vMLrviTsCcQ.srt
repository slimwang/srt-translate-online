1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:04,636
So we can see, at any given time,
the handle in the tray,

2
00:00:04,636 --> 00:00:06,757
and where its position is.

3
00:00:06,757 --> 00:00:07,620
>> Okay.
>> And

4
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:12,573
we can also see the size
of the view port as well.

5
00:00:12,573 --> 00:00:13,480
>> So let's go back.

6
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:16,799
What's the user's purpose
in using this application?

7
00:00:16,799 --> 00:00:18,098
>> Is via the text.

8
00:00:18,098 --> 00:00:19,658
>> So that's got to be a percept, right?

9
00:00:19,658 --> 00:00:21,090
>> Okay.
>> That has to be something

10
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:22,120
that's there.

11
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:22,970
And there's one other one.

12
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:24,850
It's a little bit more subtle.

13
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:29,740
That was part of the statement
of what the application does.

14
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:32,957
And has to do with the scrollbar handle.

15
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:35,556
>> Oh, okay.
So

16
00:00:35,556 --> 00:00:39,770
I think I might know what
you're talking about here.

17
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:43,590
The size of the handle will have to

18
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:47,450
relate to how much of the document
we're currently seeing.

19
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:49,570
>> So if we were ultimately
going to implement this thing,

20
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:54,940
we have to make sure that that
particular percept was updated when we

21
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:59,750
change to a file of a different size or
we change the view port Window's size.

22
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:06,170
So we have these four percepts that
are going to correspond to attributes.

23
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:11,640
And we can assign them to the particular
components that we're modeling.
