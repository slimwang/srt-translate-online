00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,550
Earlier on, we talked about how many gallons of cleaning solution Grant should

2
00:00:04,562 --> 00:00:09,100
buy depending on how many orders he received from customers. Initially, Grant

3
00:00:09,112 --> 00:00:13,545
had thought that he wanted to keep ten extra gallons of cleaning solution on

4
00:00:13,557 --> 00:00:18,409
hand at all times, but he's changed his mind a little bit. He's gotten a ton of

5
00:00:18,421 --> 00:00:23,294
orders, more than he was expecting. So, he's decided to adjust his surplus from

6
00:00:23,306 --> 00:00:27,903
10 gallons to 20 gallons. What equation do we need now to describe how many

7
00:00:27,915 --> 00:00:32,713
gallons of cleaning solution Grant should buy, depending on many orders he's

8
00:00:32,725 --> 00:00:37,692
received? To be super clear, I've written down what each of our variables in the

9
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:42,784
original equation stood for. Also, the surplus of cleaning solution is the only

10
00:00:42,796 --> 00:00:47,606
thing that Grant wants to change. He's not going to change the number of gallons

11
00:00:47,618 --> 00:00:49,498
that he buys per expected order.
