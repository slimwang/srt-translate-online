1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,390
When it comes to defense
against attacks,

2
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:06,240
the most important principle
is to employ defense-in-depth.

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,420
In other words, we should deploy
multiple layers of defense mechanisms.

4
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:13,210
The first line is a prevention mechanism

5
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:17,030
that stops attacks from getting
in our networks and systems.

6
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:21,040
Inevitably though, some attacks can
defeat the prevention mechanisms.

7
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:22,880
That is, there are holes or

8
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:27,200
weaknesses in the prevention mechanisms
that allow some attacks to get through.

9
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:31,050
For example, an attack can be a
JavaScript that can only be triggered by

10
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:35,980
a specified time in a future, and so
it'll be hard for the prevention system

11
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:40,940
to stop this attack now because it does
not know or see the attack behavior yet.

12
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:43,170
The second line of
defense is detection and

13
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:46,980
response mechanisms that watch
activities on our systems and

14
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:50,230
networks to detect attacks and
repair the damages.

15
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:54,860
Again, there will be attacks that can
go undetected, at least for a while.

16
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:55,560
For example,

17
00:00:55,560 --> 00:01:00,280
attacks that blend in with normal
activities such as the ATP malware that

18
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:04,940
is a malicious browser plugin would be
hard to detect initially, not until its

19
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:10,380
effects such as data loss due to stolen
credentials manifest sometime later.

20
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:13,890
The third line of defense is
attack resilient technologies.

21
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:18,140
The enable the core elements or
the most valuable systems on the network

22
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:20,760
to survive attacks and
continue to function.

23
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:25,250
For example, a server is actually
a collection of diversified systems.

24
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:30,050
Varies with different implementations so
that at least one of them will not be

25
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:34,815
susceptible to the attack because
an attack typically exploits

26
00:01:34,815 --> 00:01:39,610
specific vulnerabilities that only exist
in some, but not all, implementations.

27
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:43,350
To summarize, we need to deploy
defensive in-depth mechanisms,

28
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:47,260
or multiple layers of security
mechanisms to protect our networks.
