1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:02,430
So go ahead and fix a problem that calls the

2
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:06,400
error. So here's my query to get the conferences right, order

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:09,790
by name, so let's just take that off. We don't want

4
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:13,260
to order by name right there, instead, we want to order

5
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:15,740
by max attendees, we put that right after we add

6
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:19,100
the filter for it. But we still want to order by name,

7
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:22,280
so let's just add that second sort order in here. Then

8
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:25,580
you can go ahead and test the function. Just make sure

9
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,050
that you actually have some conferences that satisfy

10
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:32,180
all these criteria, otherwise you won't get any results.

11
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:33,820
So let's say you've got this query, to

12
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:37,360
get all the conferences. How would you update it

13
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,550
to filter for conferences in Tokyo, where there's

14
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:43,370
at least one but less than ten seats available?

15
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:46,090
And the results are sorted by the number seats

16
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:49,220
available, the name of the conference, and the month.

17
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:54,880
So when you figured it out, go ahead and enter the code here.
