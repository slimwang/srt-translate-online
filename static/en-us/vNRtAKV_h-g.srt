>> Hi, I'm Miriam. >> And, I'm Julie and we're your instructors for College

00:00:04,112 --> 00:00:08,077
Algebra, Animals, Architecture and Innovation. >> You'll be seeing a lot of our

3
00:00:08,089 --> 00:00:11,687
hands throughout the course, but we thought we would show you our faces too, so

4
00:00:11,699 --> 00:00:15,469
you could get to know us better. >> For you people out there, who don't think

5
00:00:15,481 --> 00:00:18,907
you are math people, we're out here to prove you wrong. Recent research has

6
00:00:18,919 --> 00:00:22,097
shown that students who have difficulties learning mathematics, have

7
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:25,656
difficulties not because they're not smart, but because often they've had bad

8
00:00:25,668 --> 00:00:29,723
experiences learning mathematics. What's even better is that you can help your

9
00:00:29,735 --> 00:00:33,543
brain grow through doing math. This course is designed to help you play around

10
00:00:33,555 --> 00:00:37,201
with college algebra. Try to step out, make mistakes, try again, just get

11
00:00:37,213 --> 00:00:41,077
involved with it. Research also shows that making mistakes helps with learning.

12
00:00:41,167 --> 00:00:44,900
You're hear to learn about college algebra. We don't expect you to know

13
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:46,011
everything.

14
00:00:46,026 --> 00:00:49,013
And you're not alone either, we have thousands of students all over the world

15
00:00:49,025 --> 00:00:52,135
taking this course. Talking about math can actually help you learn it better and

16
00:00:52,147 --> 00:00:55,455
the forum is a great place to do this. You can ask questions about things you

17
00:00:55,467 --> 00:00:58,350
don't understand or even just about cool algebra related things. So that's

18
00:00:58,728 --> 00:01:02,029
probably pretty different from other math classes you've taken before. It's

19
00:01:02,041 --> 00:01:05,541
theme based and it focuses on inquiry learning which means that we help you

20
00:01:05,553 --> 00:01:09,155
discover the mathematics on your own and show how it's relevant for your life.

21
00:01:09,243 --> 00:01:11,470
We hope you enjoy the course. Let's get started.
