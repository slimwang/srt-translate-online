1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,480
So in the lazy model, as we saw

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:06,830
in the picture, there were less communication events. Which

3
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:09,860
means you have less messages that are flowing

4
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:13,210
through the network, in order to carry out the

5
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:17,060
coherence actions, compared to the eager model. But

6
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:19,000
there is a downside to the lazy model as

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,970
well. And that is, at the point of

8
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:26,590
acquisition, you don't have all the coherence actions complete.

9
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:31,800
And therefore you may have to incur more latency at the point of acquire to

10
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,950
wait for all the coherence actions to get

11
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:37,340
complete. So that's the cons one might think

12
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:40,019
about for the lazy model compared to the

13
00:00:40,019 --> 00:00:42,890
eager model. Procrastination helps in releasing the number

14
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:45,990
of messages. But it could result in more

15
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:48,325
latency at the point of acquiring the lock.
