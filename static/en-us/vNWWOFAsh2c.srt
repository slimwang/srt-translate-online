00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:04,656
But what happens when a person takes a drug? That is, why do some people take

2
00:00:04,656 --> 00:00:09,389
drugs again and again and sometimes to access? We do know that genetics can

3
00:00:09,389 --> 00:00:14,955
play a role in how reinforcing a drug's effect is for an individual. Now, a

4
00:00:14,955 --> 00:00:19,755
drug reinforcer Is any drug that produces effects that cause or result in the

5
00:00:19,755 --> 00:00:26,660
person taking the drug again. Drugs of abuse are termed positive reinforcers.

6
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:30,756
We'll discuss reinforcers in more detail in our lesson on learning, which is

7
00:00:30,756 --> 00:00:35,804
the next lesson. One factor that plays a major role in the reinforcing

8
00:00:35,804 --> 00:00:39,769
effectiveness of a drugs action Is the root of administration that the drug is

9
00:00:39,769 --> 00:00:45,846
delivered. The faster the onset of a drug's action, the greater reinforcing

10
00:00:45,846 --> 00:00:51,941
effects. So injecting and inhaling routes are more reinforcing. In the oral

11
00:00:51,941 --> 00:00:55,540
route, because the drug enters the central nervous system faster during

12
00:00:55,540 --> 00:01:00,162
injecting and inhaling. Now, for the oral route, the drug has a path through

13
00:01:00,162 --> 00:01:03,690
the digestive system and compete for metabolism for whatever else is in the

14
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:09,072
stomach. For example, pizza or cheeseburger. Thus the drug takes longer to

15
00:01:09,072 --> 00:01:13,730
reach the sites of action in the central nervous system when taken orally.

16
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:17,202
Here, let's look at these a little closer. Injecting drugs is one of the

17
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:23,681
fastest and most dangerous routes of administration for a variety of reasons.

18
00:01:23,681 --> 00:01:28,595
Including the increased risk of blood-borne diseases such as HIV and AIDS,

19
00:01:28,595 --> 00:01:34,969
hepatitis In collapsing of veins after long time injecting. Inhalation or

20
00:01:34,969 --> 00:01:39,190
smoking over an extended period of time can result in damage to the lungs and

21
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:45,900
bronchi, and sometimes results in coughing fits and increased mucus production.

22
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:50,620
Other roots of administration include snorting, or even transdermal patches.

23
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:54,097
You're most likely aware of nicotine patches that are used as a method for

24
00:01:54,097 --> 00:01:59,618
quitting smoking. Patches allow for extended release of the drug. There are

25
00:01:59,618 --> 00:02:03,258
even patches for powerful pain reducing drugs that are used for the treatment

26
00:02:03,258 --> 00:02:07,050
of some cancers. But now, let's switch gears, and talk a little bit about the

27
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:07,820
brain.
