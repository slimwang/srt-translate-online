00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:03,260
In addition to our cognitive development, our social and emotional development

2
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:07,206
is really important. Why do you think it is that mammals and birds are so

3
00:00:07,206 --> 00:00:12,255
connected to our caregivers early in life, but fish and reptiles aren't? Well,

4
00:00:12,255 --> 00:00:15,293
it's a bit complicated, but it really boils down to this: mammals and birds

5
00:00:15,293 --> 00:00:20,988
need our caregivers to survive. Fish and reptiles don't. Warm blooded animals

6
00:00:20,988 --> 00:00:24,774
form close bonds with their care givers. This is what psychologists call

7
00:00:24,774 --> 00:00:28,184
attachment. Now, Greg is going to explain to you guys about the first

8
00:00:28,184 --> 00:00:32,200
psychologist who showed us just how important attachment is in development.
