1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
And once again, we get 0.3 and the reason is, as we go up, 0.3 is being funneled into the function f.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
F starts over here and p is now 0.3.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,000
We return then the value 0.3 straight from the input and then the return of this is being printed.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:26,549
Sounds complex--well, from now on all I want you to do is to modify what's inside this function.
