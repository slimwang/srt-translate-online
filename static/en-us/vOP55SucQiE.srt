1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,910
So our answer here isn't really very pretty, but it is something that we can

2
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:09,650
tell right off the bat is a complex number, and we can tell how big the real

3
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:14,601
part is, and how big the imaginary part is. Our answer is negative 1 over 26,

4
00:00:14,601 --> 00:00:15,803
minus 21 over 26 i.
