1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:04,220
First, ESP can provide
both confidentiality and

2
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:05,660
integrity protection.

3
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:06,770
This is true.

4
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:10,920
Second, if authentication
option of ESP is chosen,

5
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:14,840
message integrity code is
computed before encryption.

6
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:16,160
This is false,

7
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,960
because the message integrity code
is computed after encryption.

8
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:26,250
Third, to protect the confidentiality
and integrity of the whole original

9
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:31,680
IP packet, we can ESP with
authentication option in tunnel mode.

10
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:36,090
This is true, because in tunnel mode the
encryption will cover the whole original

11
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:41,160
packet, and the authentication will
also covers the original packet.

12
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:45,970
Fourth, in The integrity
hash covers the IP header.

13
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:46,470
This is true.
