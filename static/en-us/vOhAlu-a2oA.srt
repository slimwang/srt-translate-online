I'd like you to keep getting more practice using long division, so let's do

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:07,260
this problem as well. This time we're starting out with x cubed minus 1, and

3
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:11,606
I'd like us to divide that by x minus 1. How do you write this using long

4
00:00:11,606 --> 00:00:15,560
division though? Well, you might think it would be this way, like before all

5
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:17,840
I've done is taken the thing we want to divide, written our lovely long

6
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:22,213
division surrounding it. And then written the thing we want to divide it by

7
00:00:22,213 --> 00:00:25,905
outside. This isn't going to work quite right in this situation of this

8
00:00:25,905 --> 00:00:30,268
polynomial though. Here's why. We only have two terms here, but this is a cubic

9
00:00:30,268 --> 00:00:34,233
polynomial. With other cubic's we've worked with, we've had a term for every

10
00:00:34,233 --> 00:00:38,635
single power starting with the highest power and descending. This time we don't

11
00:00:38,635 --> 00:00:41,915
have an x squared term and we don't have an x term. In order to do long

12
00:00:41,915 --> 00:00:45,179
division properly though, we still need to leave slots for those terms In the

13
00:00:45,179 --> 00:00:49,250
expression that we start out with. Instead we're going to need to write the

14
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:53,950
polynomial like this. Note that by writing 0x squared and 0x for the x squared

15
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:56,753
and x terms, we're not changing the value of the original expression we had

16
00:00:56,753 --> 00:01:02,647
underneath the division sign. But we are still leaving room for the terms of

17
00:01:02,647 --> 00:01:07,180
these powers. Now we're in great shape to do our division. So let's do it!

18
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:09,899
