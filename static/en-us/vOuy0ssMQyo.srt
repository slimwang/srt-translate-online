00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:03,920
In putting this all together, an important point to

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:09,050
get across is there's no such single, tangible thing as in the architecture.

3
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:12,940
An architecture is a set of decisions.

4
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:17,830
You can convey some of the information about those decisions with various views,

5
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:21,340
whether they're graphical or textual, okay?

6
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:24,350
And their sum conveys the architecture.

7
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:28,160
For your purposes as a developer, you need to select the appropriate views

8
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,530
depending upon the structure of the system, that is the complexity and

9
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:37,430
the application domain of the system and the particular people that are going to

10
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:40,250
be looking at those diagrams or reading that text.
