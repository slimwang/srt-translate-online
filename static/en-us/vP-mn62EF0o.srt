00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
[Narrator] Thus far, we've only looked at the form of an utterance or sentence,

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
what words it has, whether they fit the subject, object, verb kind of ordering,

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
but we haven't really looked at what they mean.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
It turns out that these 2 are not the same thing,

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
and one of the most famous counter examples comes, again, from our man Noam Chomsky

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
with the sentence, "Colorless green ideas sleep furiously."

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
And this is a sentence that's syntactically well formed.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Idea is the noun; sleep is the verb.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
This is an adverb.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
These are all modifiers that make it a noun phrase, but it's not clear what the meaning is.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Actually, let me try to sketch it out.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
We've got some ideas, and I hear that one always represents ideas with old tiny lightbulbs,

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
except that our ideas are colorless so let's ignore this yellow somehow,

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
and simultaneously green.

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
This--it's not obvious how to draw this, and then there's sleeping,

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
and I think the universal symbol for that in English is a bunch of Zs.

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The sound that snoring makes in colloquial English,

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
but they're sleeping furiously so Zzzzz, lots of Zs,

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
and as my total difficulty to sketch this,

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I should point out, well, A: I'm bad at sketching,

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
but B: it's really not clear what this means.

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
What does it mean for an idea to sleep?

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I thought ideas were conceptions that people had; can ideas go to sleep?

24
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
And people can try to put poetic interpretations on this.

25
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
You can imagine a sort of a prose or poetic way of reading this,

26
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
but in general I can sort of alter the sentence and make it still syntactically correct

27
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
but symantically more and more contradictory.

28
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
It's really not clear what this sentences means.

29
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Turns out that we have similar notions in computer programming languages.

30
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,000
In python, you can write 1 + 1 or hello + world and get reasonable answers out,

31
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
but what happens if I try to write 1 + hello?

32
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
This does not really make sense.

33
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
It's not clear what it means to add an integer to a string,

34
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
and in general if you feed such a program fragment or expression to a python interpreter,

35
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,000
it will give you some sort of run-time era which is the equivalent of throwing up its hands and saying, "I don't know."

36
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Just to review what it means for a program to lead to a run-time era or to describe something that doesn't make much symantic sense,

37
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:23,000
here I've written 4 program fragments, and what I'd like you to do is check each one that would lead to some sort of run-time era,

38
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
and you have to assume that each one is a complete program.

39
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
What you see is what you get; there are no other hidden variables or imports declared earlier.

40
00:02:31,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Multiple multiple choice, try it out.
