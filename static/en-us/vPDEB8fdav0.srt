1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,764
Our last step is to simplify common factors that appear in the numerator and the

2
00:00:04,764 --> 00:00:09,563
denominator. I can divide each of these numbers by 1 and 2 10ths, and I'll have

3
00:00:09,563 --> 00:00:14,303
3 over 1. Next, I can divide 3 into 3 and 6. I rewrite my expression and then I

4
00:00:14,303 --> 00:00:19,043
divide 1 and 8 10ths and I get 9 10ths. Our number isn't quite yet in scientific

5
00:00:19,043 --> 00:00:23,666
notation, we'll need to move this decimal one place to right. So what should

6
00:00:23,666 --> 00:00:27,887
this last exponent be? Take some time to think about, and think about writing

7
00:00:27,887 --> 00:00:29,406
this number out if it helps you.
