1
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:02,620
Wow, that was complicated.

2
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:04,170
You think that blowing
robots to smithereens

3
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:06,560
would be the easiest thing in the world,
right?

4
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,620
Awesome work keeping track
of GigaGal's bullets and

5
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:13,430
myriad explosions and with that the core
mechanics of GigaGal are complete.

6
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:16,110
In the next two levels we'll
add in the capabilities to

7
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:18,170
load up a level from an external file.

8
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:21,160
And then we'll add a ton of polish
to the game rules, add a HUD, and

9
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,310
mobile controls.

10
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:22,810
Keep it up.
