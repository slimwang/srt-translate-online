1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The answer is "no,"

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
because these numbers over here are too large.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Why is this bad?

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
You can see that in a maze like this you would expand node over here

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
before we touch any of the nodes over here.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
If those are an optimal path, then we might miss them

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
and pick what might end up being a suboptimal path

8
00:00:20,000 --> 99:59:59,999
even though in this specific case all the paths seem to be equally good.
