00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:05,070
Let's look at our in order versus out of order quiz solution.

2
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:10,710
We said already that we have to fetch the code and issue instructions in order.

3
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:15,050
Dispatching is happening in the order of dependencies not necessarily totally in

4
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:20,110
program order so this is out of order. Execution then happens out of order.

5
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:24,250
We broadcast results. When we finish execution out of order.

6
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:26,920
But then commit has to happen in order, and

7
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:30,790
then because we commit in order, the rest of the pipeline after commit,

8
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:35,080
if there is anything will be also in order. So this is what happens in order and

9
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:38,710
what happens out of order in an out of order processor.

10
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:42,870
If this were an in order processor, these would also be here.
