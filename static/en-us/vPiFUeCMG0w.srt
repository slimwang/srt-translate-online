00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,720
Here is a second quiz.

2
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:05,250
Again, there are a number of processes,
P1 through P4, and

3
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:07,320
their execution over time.

4
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:11,830
And the question is, considering
the following sequence of operations,

5
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:14,580
is this execution
sequentially consistent?

6
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:18,990
And then what if the question was,
is it causally consistent?

7
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:21,850
For each of the models,
sequentially consistent or

8
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:25,600
causally consistent,
answer the question with yes or no.
