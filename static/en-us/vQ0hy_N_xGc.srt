00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Now let's expose the weakness of the maximum likelihood estimator.

00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Let's be wicked. Suppose I flip the coin exactly once and it comes up heads.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 99:59:59,999
What do you think is the probability of heads for this coin under the maximum likelihood estimator?
