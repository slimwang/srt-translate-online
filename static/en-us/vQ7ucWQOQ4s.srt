1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,290
This brings us to the definition
of constraint propagation.

2
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:07,110
Constraint propagation
is a method of inference

3
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:09,650
that assigns values to variables

4
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:13,270
characterizing a problem in such a way
that some conditions are satisfied.

5
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:15,170
So if you have any problem,

6
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:17,459
that problem is going to be
characterized by some variables.

7
00:00:18,506 --> 00:00:23,590
And the task is to give specific values
to each variable in such a way that

8
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:26,440
some global constraints
have been satisfied.

9
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:30,092
So given a problem, some problems
are characterized by a set of variables,

10
00:00:30,092 --> 00:00:32,802
each variable may locally
take on some values.

11
00:00:32,802 --> 00:00:37,150
So probably the question is, how can
we locally assign values to variables

12
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:40,190
in such a way that some global
constraints are satisfied?

13
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:42,140
As an example,
let us return to this figure.

14
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:47,470
Here is a figure, drawn on a 2D surface,
and the problem is whether or

15
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:49,870
not it represents a 3D object.

16
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:52,930
The variables here are the surfaces and
the orientations.

17
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:55,370
One could consider this to be a single,

18
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:58,240
two dimensional surface with
some lines drawn on it.

19
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:01,480
Alternatively, one can think of
this as having four surfaces,

20
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:05,750
one, two, three, four, where each
surface has a particular orientation.

21
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:09,180
The orientation can be specified by
the perpendicular of that surface.

22
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:12,800
The method of constraint propagation is
going to help identify the surfaces and

23
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,100
their orientations.

24
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:17,450
The constraints here
are defined by these junctions.

25
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:21,400
For trihedral objects where three
surfaces meet at a particular point,

26
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,580
these junctions have certain properties.

27
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:25,640
No matter how we assign
these surfaces and

28
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:30,680
their orientations, the assignment
must satisfy all of those constraints.

29
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:33,490
We'll look at the details of
constraint propagation in a minute.

30
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:36,170
But first notice that there are two
possible interpretations to this

31
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:37,890
particular 3D object.

32
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:41,410
One can look at it as if one
were looking inside a box.

33
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:44,920
Alternatively, one can look at it as
if one were looking at a building.

34
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:47,890
This means that constraint
propagation need not

35
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:52,120
necessarily always succeed in
this ambiguity between different

36
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:55,140
kind of assignments of
surfaces in the orientation.

37
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:58,410
Sometimes multiple interpretations
can simultaneously satisfy

38
00:01:58,410 --> 00:01:59,760
all the constraints.

39
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:05,040
It is also possible that no assignment
of values with variables will satisfy

40
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,940
all the constraints, in which case
interpretation becomes very difficult.

41
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:11,720
As another example,
let us examine this sentence.

42
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:14,240
Colorless green ideas sleep furiously.

43
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:17,080
All of us can recognize that this
is semantically meaningless, but

44
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,520
grammatically correct.

45
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:21,110
How did we know that this
is grammatically correct?

46
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:25,560
The variables here are the various
lexical categories, like words and

47
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,590
nouns and some different predicates.

48
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:33,153
The values are the assignments we
make to these various words here.

49
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:34,673
Is green a noun?

50
00:02:34,673 --> 00:02:35,869
Is green a verb?

51
00:02:35,869 --> 00:02:37,135
Green a determiner?

52
00:02:37,135 --> 00:02:39,490
Is it part of a subject or
part of a predicate?

53
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:44,130
The constraints here are defined with
the rules of English language grammar.

54
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:48,310
As we assign values to the various
variables here, that assignment

55
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:51,900
must satisfy the constraints of
the English language grammar so

56
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:55,460
that as we assign values
to these variables,

57
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:58,490
those assignments must satisfy
the constraints of the English language

58
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:03,000
grammar before we can accept this
sentence to be grammatically correct.

59
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,020
If this sentence was
grammatically not correct,

60
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:09,840
then we will not be able to assign
values to all the variables in a way

61
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,930
that will satisfy the constraints
imposed by the English language grammar.

62
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:16,560
>> So we've actually come across this
idea of constraints in English language

63
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,020
grammar before.

64
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:20,990
During our lesson on understanding we
talked about how a preposition, for

65
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:24,090
example, can constrain the meaning
of the word that follows it.

66
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:25,990
If we see the word from, for example,

67
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:29,180
we expect what comes after it to be
some kind of source for the sentence.

68
00:03:30,258 --> 00:03:33,140
There we used grammatical constraints
in service of some kind of

69
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:34,560
semantic analysis.

70
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,390
Here we're just using grammatical
constraints to figure out if a sentence

71
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:39,210
is grammatically correct or not.

72
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:41,762
There's another connection
here to understanding as well.

73
00:03:41,762 --> 00:03:44,480
Ashok talked about how we can
interpret this shape as either popping

74
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,360
out towards us or down into the screen.

75
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,510
We talked about two simultaneously
accurate interpretations of the same

76
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:55,140
thing and understanding with regard to
sentences that can be read as puns.

77
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:58,320
So for example, when I said,
it's hard to explain puns to

78
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,940
kleptomaniacs because they
always take things literally.

79
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:04,750
The word take can simultaneously
be interpreted as interpret and

80
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:08,040
physically remove, while satisfying
all the constraints of the sentence.
