1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:01,980
So, what should you use if you need

2
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:04,900
a complex data storage system? Well, there's one more

3
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:09,350
system, the Indexed Database API, also called IndexedDB for

4
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:12,920
short. Indexed Database was designed in response to Web

5
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:16,290
SQL, and its SQLite variant. Indexed Database is

6
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:19,200
not a SQL API, it's a simpler index storage

7
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,890
system, on which you can build an optimized query

8
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:25,270
implementation, like a, a SQL variant. This means it

9
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:28,720
isn't optimized to a particular query system. Instead, when

10
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:32,020
you create your database, you define what indexes you want

11
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:35,835
to use. If you've never done database storage before,

12
00:00:35,835 --> 00:00:38,670
IndexDB may take a little bit of getting used to,

13
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:41,970
but it's actually pretty straight forward. The spec itself

14
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:44,170
has some really good examples in it. This code is

15
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:47,040
based on the spec. FIrst, you need to open

16
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:50,280
your database and you need to be prepared to initialize

17
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:53,110
the database if it hasn't been opened before. When you

18
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:56,120
initialize the database, you can define the indexes in the

19
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:59,950
database, that is, what attributes are easily searchable. You can

20
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:03,590
change this later too, you just have to upgrade the database.

21
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:05,930
And of course you can inspect the databases in the

22
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:10,030
developer tools to see what's going in to the IndexDB store.

23
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:11,830
And check to make sure it's organized the way you

24
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:17,050
want it. Just go into the Resources tab, select IndexDB, and

25
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:20,030
there you go. You can see your objects right there.

26
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:22,300
If you expand them, you can even see the values.
