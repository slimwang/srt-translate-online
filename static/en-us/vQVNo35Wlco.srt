1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Our goal is to show that a one-time pad is a perfect cipher,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
and now that we have the definition of a perfect cipher,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
we should be able to argue that formally.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
This was our definition.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Since our definition uses the conditional probability,

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
we should also remember the definition of conditional probability,

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
which is the probability of some event A conditioned on event B happening

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
is equal to the probability of A intersect B divided by the probability of B.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
To show that the one-time pad is a perfect cipher,

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:38,000
we just need to calculate this where A will be this event and B will be this event.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
We need to know the probability of B,

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
which is the probability that some message with some key encrypts to C.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Let's compute that first. Then we'll need to compute the probability of A intersect B.

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
We'll have a little quiz.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Given any message and any cipher text C, and we're using a one-time pad,

16
00:00:56,000 --> 99:59:59,999
how many different keys are there that encrypt that message to that cipher text?
