00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:02,469
All right, it's time for
your first project.

2
00:00:02,469 --> 00:00:04,000
You'll write a bit of code here, but

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
this is really an exercise in learning
to use the resources available to you.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,235
You'll first solve some riddles to
escape the made-up land of RubyDocs, and

5
00:00:11,235 --> 00:00:13,680
will then reflect on your experiences so
far and where you're going.

6
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:16,860
This will be your first time interacting
with our project reviewers and

7
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:18,830
experiencing the review process in full.

8
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:19,780
So, let's get started.
