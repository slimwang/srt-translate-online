00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:03,246
So let's take a look at the quiz solution. First off, you should be able to

2
00:00:03,246 --> 00:00:07,975
define a key state array of 256 elements wide. Again, this represents the

3
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:12,487
potential key input from an ASCII keyboard. In addition to that, we already had

4
00:00:12,487 --> 00:00:15,922
the key down event listener attached. You had to simply go through and add the

5
00:00:15,922 --> 00:00:20,068
on key up one. To properly cache state into our array, the key down and the key

6
00:00:20,068 --> 00:00:23,844
up event handlers simply needed to use the key ID variable of the event input,

7
00:00:23,844 --> 00:00:29,658
and set the state to either true or false. And then in the update function, as

8
00:00:29,658 --> 00:00:32,950
we see, nothing really changed except dropping the beat.
