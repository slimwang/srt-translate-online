1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
So now that we have this, what should we do to get a contradiction

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
and prove that there's no maximum prime number?

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
So the possibilities are to: divide by Q;

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
to divide by P i;

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
or try proof by intimidation.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
This is an especially effective proof technique when we're proving something that Euclid already proved.
