1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:03,749
Let's go through and figure out what each 
of the composite functions for every pair

2
00:00:03,749 --> 00:00:06,810
here would be. 
Then we can answer whether or not they're

3
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:09,850
the same. 
For this first pair we have f of x equals

4
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:15,558
x squared, and g of x equals x plus 1. 
That means that f composed with g would

5
00:00:15,558 --> 00:00:19,770
give us x plus 1 squared. 
But if we have g composed with f, then

6
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:25,780
instead, we get x squared, plus 1. 
These are not the same, so let's check no.

7
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:29,560
For the next one we have f of x, equals x 
plus 1, and g of x equals x plus 2, and

8
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:34,210
in this case both of our compositions are 
the same.

9
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:37,928
It doesn't matter. 
Whether we add 2 and then 1, or 1 and

10
00:00:37,928 --> 00:00:41,970
then 2 to x. 
In both cases, we end up with x plus 3.

11
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:47,120
So, lets check yes for this one. 
Interesting, and now for the fun part.

12
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,305
Is putting on your left shoe, and then 
putting on your right shoe, going to give

13
00:00:50,305 --> 00:00:55,410
you the same outcome as putting on your 
right shoe, and then putting on your left shoe?

14
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:59,340
Well in both cases, you're going to end 
up with both shoes on your feet.

15
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:02,580
So, yes. 
F of g, and g of f, are the same.

16
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:06,090
Now, we have one function, as putting on 
your shoes, and the other as putting on

17
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:09,200
your socks. 
So, is putting on your socks and then

18
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,340
your shoes, the same as putting on your 
shoes and then your socks?

19
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:17,270
Well, in one case, we end up with a 
pretty normal situation, socks underneath shoes.

20
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:20,625
In the other case, though, when we have 
shoes underneath our socks, You'd

21
00:01:20,625 --> 00:01:25,750
probably be pretty uncomfortable. 
Your socks might not even fit over your shoes.

22
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:30,490
Either ways, socks underneath shoes or 
shoes underneath socks, are not the same thing.

23
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:32,330
So we're going to have to check no on 
this one.

24
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:35,990
And last but not least, we have two 
functions that are getting dressed and

25
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:39,398
taking a shower. 
Now, one of these seems to produce a

26
00:01:39,398 --> 00:01:44,190
pretty normal everyday activity. 
You take a shower and then you get dressed.

27
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:46,140
But, what if we did things the other way 
around?

28
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:49,794
I, for one, would be pretty sad if I put 
on my favorite dress and then got in the

29
00:01:49,794 --> 00:01:54,640
shower and got myself soaking wet. 
That would not be a great start to my day.

30
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,288
So I think we can safely say that taking 
a shower, and then getting dressed, is

31
00:01:58,288 --> 00:02:02,740
very different from getting dressed, and 
then taking a shower.

32
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:08,619
So no, the two compositions of these 
functions that we could do are not the same.
