You've just computed the average area of a bunch of countries. Now, let's say,

2
00:00:05,099 --> 00:00:09,818
we have a different data set, a bunch of cars, and we'd like to know their

3
00:00:09,818 --> 00:00:16,470
average fuel efficiency. Again, I'd like to have a method average that does

4
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:22,921
that, and the data class. And again, I'd like you to write that method.
