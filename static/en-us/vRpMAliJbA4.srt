1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:04,230
So the first step in what you had to do
was to modify your build.gradle file.

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:05,300
And as you can see here,

3
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:09,060
I've done this by adding
the Google Play services libraries.

4
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:13,380
I'm just using 6.5.+, but
as we spoke about in earlier sessions,

5
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:16,040
you should always make sure that
you're using the most recent version.

6
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:18,190
And use the full number,
don't use a plus.

7
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:20,660
But I'm just putting plus in here for
ease of use.

8
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:23,440
Next, you have to edit your
AndroidManifest file, and

9
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,430
you can see that here.

10
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:26,650
So, if I double click on that, and

11
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:30,330
open it, I can see my AndroidManifest
file and the details in it.

12
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:32,150
Now, there are a number of
things that needed to be added.

13
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:36,240
The first thing that you had to
add was the ability to use OpenGL.

14
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:39,658
And, as you can see, I'm using OpenGL
here with the users feature tag.

15
00:00:39,658 --> 00:00:45,670
android:glEsVersion=0x002000 and
required=true.

16
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:49,430
So this gets added onto the manifest
tag above the application tag.

17
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:53,015
The second thing that you wanted to
add within the application tag was

18
00:00:53,015 --> 00:00:56,930
metadata saying that you're using
the play_services libraries.

19
00:00:56,930 --> 00:01:00,860
Here you can see Android name equals
Com Google Android GMS version.

20
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:04,530
Android value equals ad integer
of Google Play Services version.

21
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:07,660
So these are the same tags that
you've been adding to be able

22
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:11,060
to use the services libraries
throughout this course.

23
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:15,190
The next tag here is the metadata for
your API key.

24
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:18,342
And the API key is what you
created in the Google Developers

25
00:01:18,342 --> 00:01:19,510
console earlier on.

26
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:24,347
Here you can see I've added the API key,
and just the values that I was

27
00:01:24,347 --> 00:01:28,851
able to get form my API console I
put into the Android value tag for

28
00:01:28,851 --> 00:01:32,626
com.google.android.maps.v2_.API_KEY.

29
00:01:32,626 --> 00:01:34,495
So you've added the OpenGL,

30
00:01:34,495 --> 00:01:40,110
you've added the Google Play services
libraries and you've added your API key.

31
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:42,610
The final thing that you need
to add to your Android manifest

32
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:46,030
are the users' permission tags,
and here you can see them.

33
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:49,255
So users' permission for
android.permission.internet,

34
00:01:49,255 --> 00:01:51,995
android.permission.accesssnetworkstate,
and

35
00:01:51,995 --> 00:01:54,510
androidpermission.writeexternalstorage.

36
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:57,710
So, once you've added all of these,
your android manifest is good to go.

37
00:01:57,710 --> 00:01:58,900
Your build gradle is done and

38
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:01,140
you're now ready to add
the map to your application.
