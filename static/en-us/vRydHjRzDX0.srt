1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,948
The process of finding the right
investor is not an easy one.

2
00:00:03,948 --> 00:00:07,658
I think it really begins in
understanding who are the investors that

3
00:00:07,658 --> 00:00:10,340
are going to be
attracted to what you do.

4
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:14,720
So, for example, you can go out and
find investors that like your domain.

5
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:19,186
They have invested in companies in your
space, not in a competitor of yours,

6
00:00:19,186 --> 00:00:21,742
but in your type of technology or
business.

7
00:00:21,742 --> 00:00:24,185
And perhaps,
they would have the propensity and

8
00:00:24,185 --> 00:00:25,740
the interest to invest in you.

9
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:30,125
So, making out that list,
you can search on Angie's List and

10
00:00:30,125 --> 00:00:34,570
CrunchBase and other free data sources
out there to find those investors.

11
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:35,570
That would be number one.

12
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:39,094
Number two is,
I think people that perhaps you've come,

13
00:00:39,094 --> 00:00:41,210
throughout your career,

14
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:45,110
perhaps working in an early stage
startup and you were an early employee.

15
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:49,110
And maybe there's an investor
that invested in that company.

16
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:53,160
Maybe those are investors that
invested in your friends, right?

17
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,560
People that actually can look at you and

18
00:00:55,560 --> 00:01:00,260
know that what you've done before this
startup is something quite amazing.

19
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:04,099
And they might want to invest in you
going forward, because of who you are,

20
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:05,340
because they believe in you.

21
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:10,710
So, looking at investors in your domain,
looking at investors that

22
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:15,410
share the same career path with you, or
invested in startups you work with, and

23
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:18,050
then reaching out to investors
that maybe your friends know,

24
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:20,990
that invested in their businesses,
that your friends can vouch for

25
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:23,270
you when they make the introduction
to those investors.
