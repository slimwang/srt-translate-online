00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:03,627
So far our programs always do the same thing. I mean when when we run it a

2
00:00:03,627 --> 00:00:05,755
second time, it does exactly what it did before.

3
00:00:05,755 --> 00:00:09,240
>> I don't get it. We just learned about reading input. When you run the program

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:11,770
again with different inputs, it'll do something different.

5
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:15,190
>> That's not exactly what I mean. Whenever I run the program again, it runs exact

6
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:18,760
same lines of code. What if I only want to add a friend if the friend's not

7
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:19,900
already there?

8
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:24,538
>> I think the time has come to, to learn about programming decisions. Then your

9
00:00:24,538 --> 00:00:28,216
program can take different actions depending on circumstances. For example, you

10
00:00:28,216 --> 00:00:30,988
could skip the lines of code that do the adding if the friend's already in the

11
00:00:30,988 --> 00:00:34,699
list. That's exactly what I want, let's do that.
