00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:04,950
The sequence diagram and the communication diagram that we've seen aren't

2
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:10,170
particularly designed to deal with synchronization. UML has a separate diagram,

3
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:13,970
called an activity diagram, designed for this purpose.

4
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:19,640
In this diagram it's a variant of a state machine in which.

5
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:24,310
Multiple states may be simultaneously active. That is have their own threads of

6
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:27,539
control. This activity diagrams are derived from petri nets.

7
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:32,600
Petri net diagrams that have been around for many years. In the diagrams trans,

8
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:36,660
transitions are typically triggered by activity completion.

9
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:41,380
That is you finished with one state. Rather than by external events. You can

10
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:45,190
use these diagrams to model workflows, process synchronization, and concurrency.
