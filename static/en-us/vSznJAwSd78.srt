00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:03,140
So, before we continue with this project, I want

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:05,450
to highlight a few new words that we have used

3
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:09,170
in the code thus far. We've identified turtle as

4
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:13,540
a class. And brad and angie as instances of that

5
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:16,210
class. Now, I want to take a moment and

6
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:19,040
talk about these new words. You can think of a

7
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:22,210
class as a blueprint of a building. Now, a

8
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:25,590
blueprint as we know, contains certain pieces of information about

9
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:27,570
the building. For instance, the height of the

10
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:30,640
building, the number of rooms in the building. We

11
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,430
also know that the same blueprint can be used

12
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:37,390
to build multiple different buildings. For instance, an office

13
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:40,180
with yellow walls, and a residential complex with blue

14
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:44,570
walls. A class is like a blueprint. So let's

15
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:46,620
take the example of class Turtle that we've used

16
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:50,190
thus far. A class Turtle, much like a blueprint,

17
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:53,140
contains certain pieces of information about the turtle.

18
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:55,740
The turtle's size, its color, the fact that the

19
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:58,710
turtle can move forward and turn right. And from

20
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:02,400
this class, or blueprint we can create multiple different

21
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:05,560
instances of that class. For example, Brad is

22
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:08,300
an instance of class Turtle that draws a yellow

23
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:11,130
square, and Angie is also an instance of class

24
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:15,330
Turtle that draws a blue circle. So, in summation,

25
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:18,340
you can think of a class as a blueprint, and you

26
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:22,940
can think of its objects as example or instances of that blueprint.
