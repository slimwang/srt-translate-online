1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,939
So let's see if we can compare the flash
disk and the combination of the two.

2
00:00:04,939 --> 00:00:09,708
Let's say that we have a user who
will play a game for two hours, and

3
00:00:09,708 --> 00:00:15,003
the game issues reads to 2 GB of data
and writes to another 10 MB of data.

4
00:00:15,003 --> 00:00:19,221
And then after these two hours the user
switches to watching a movie for

5
00:00:19,221 --> 00:00:24,380
two hours where throughout this two
hours we will read 1 GB sequentially.

6
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:27,550
And then the user does
this three more times.

7
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:32,588
If we have a disk that can read 100
MBs a second, if we read sequentially,

8
00:00:32,588 --> 00:00:37,460
and read or write 1 MB per second,
if we do it randomly, and

9
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:41,970
if we have flash that can access
1GB per second either way.

10
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:46,790
What is the total access time for
all the data here, if we use disk?

11
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:52,710
What is the total access time with
the disk in this whole, 4 times 4 hours?

12
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:56,440
What is the total access
time if we use pure flash?

13
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:59,938
And what is the total access
time if we have a disk and

14
00:00:59,938 --> 00:01:03,320
a 4 GB flash cache that
is initially empty?
