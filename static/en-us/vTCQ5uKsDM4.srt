00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:02,610
The first thing I want to do is figure out what

2
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:05,650
the lowest score is. The methods I have available are

3
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:09,890
find, low score, and remove. So first I want to find

4
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:12,870
what the low score is. I'll call low score and put

5
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:15,610
the result into a variable of type double. Then I'll

6
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:18,800
find the exact location of that score that I know is

7
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,560
the lowest. By using the find method, and then once

8
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,000
I know where it is, I can remove it, using remove.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,540
Now that we've implemented removeLowest, a

10
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:30,380
user of the homeworkScores class could

11
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:33,980
call removeLowest before calculating the sum or average of the final grade.
