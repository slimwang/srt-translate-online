1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,607
Let's make some more of these right triangles
in this first quadrant.

2
00:00:03,607 --> 00:00:05,826
Here is another red triangle

3
00:00:05,826 --> 00:00:08,479
and here is another one as well.

4
00:00:08,479 --> 00:00:12,823
So, notice I have four different red triangles 
in the first quadrant

5
00:00:12,823 --> 00:00:16,018
and they are all related by the Pythagorean theorem.

6
00:00:16,018 --> 00:00:19,859
The length of the string is fifty centimeters
in each case.

7
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:24,500
So that means the hypotenuses of each right triangle
is fifty centimeters.

8
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:28,131
But let's create a right triangle in this quadrant.

9
00:00:28,131 --> 00:00:30,338
If I had this right triangle

10
00:00:30,338 --> 00:00:33,875
what would be the coordinates of the end 
of the string now?

11
00:00:33,875 --> 00:00:37,876
Write the coordinates for this position here.
