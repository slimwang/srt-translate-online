1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
What I'm going to do is introduce a new concept that we didn't see before

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
in our initial listing of the concepts,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
but which is an important one--the notion of a prefix of a word.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
It's important only for efficiency and not for correctness--that's why it didn't show up the first time.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
The idea is that given a word there are substrings, which are prefixes of the word.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
The empty string is such a prefix. Just W is a prefix.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
W-O is a prefix. W-O-R is a prefix.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Now, we always have to decide what we want to do with the endpoints.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I think for the way I want to use it I do want to include the empty string as a valid prefix,

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
but I think I don't want to include the entire string W-O-R-D.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'm not going to count that as a prefix of the word. That is the word.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I'm going to define this function prefixes(word). It's pretty straightforward.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Just iterate through the range, and the prefixes of W-O-R-D are the empty string

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
and these three longer strings.

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Now here's the first bit that I want you to do for me.

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Reading in our list of words from the dictionary is a little bit complicated

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
in that we want to compute two things--a set of words and a set of prefixes

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
for all the words in the dictionary.

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
The set together of prefixes for each word--union all of those together.

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'm going to put that together into a function readwordlist(), which takes the file name

21
00:01:21,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and returns these two sets. I want you to write the code for that function here.
