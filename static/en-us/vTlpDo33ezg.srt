1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:02,670
When you learned about storytelling in school,

2
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:06,030
you probably learned that good stories have a predictable arc.

3
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:09,930
They typically start out with an introduction, followed by a rising action,

4
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:12,890
a climax, and finish with a final resolution.

5
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:16,079
This is the way storytelling has been done for years and works well in

6
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:20,940
a variety of formats such as oral and written stories in TVs and movies.

7
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:24,980
The dawn of new mediums, namely computers and the Internet, have given rise to

8
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:29,390
new narrative structures that can often be much more nuanced and complex.

9
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:31,666
Let's first talk about author-driven narratives.

10
00:00:31,666 --> 00:00:36,070
Author-driven narratives typically have a well-defined start and endpoint and

11
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:39,730
proceed in a linear flow that's directed by the author of the visualization.

12
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:42,440
Viewer-driven narratives on the other hand,

13
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:46,150
while still having a well-defined start point, allow a freedom of choice for

14
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:50,080
the viewer to choose the direction in which the narrative progresses.

15
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:53,640
In this way while each user starts in the same place there are various

16
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,010
endings that they could end up depending on how they look at the data or

17
00:00:57,010 --> 00:00:59,110
the choices they made along the way.

18
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:02,430
This type of narrative is very powerful because it allows the user to

19
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:04,099
choose their our narrative.

20
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:06,370
You can think of it like a choose your own adventure book,

21
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:08,460
where you're writing the story as you're experiencing it.

22
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:10,620
Visual narratives,

23
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:14,920
often called narrative visualization, combine conventions of communicative and

24
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:19,050
exploratory information visualization to convey an intended story.

25
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:22,071
We often see stories fall within a spectrum,

26
00:01:22,071 --> 00:01:25,270
between author-driven and viewer-driven.

27
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:28,280
Visualizations that have few exploratory elements,

28
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,830
are often called author-driven.

29
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:34,460
And are useful for narratives that have strong ordering, heavy messaging, or

30
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:36,995
have a need for clarity and speed in the narrative.

31
00:01:36,995 --> 00:01:41,330
Viewer-driven narratives on the other hand, take a very different approach.

32
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:43,710
Rather than dictating a specific narrative,

33
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:46,730
it allows the viewer to freely interact with the data.

34
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:51,610
Allowing you to ask questions, explore, and tell their own data story.

35
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:55,930
Now let's look at a few examples of author-driven data visualizations.
