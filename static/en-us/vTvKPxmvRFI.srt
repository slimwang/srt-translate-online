00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
[Thrun] So we learned a lot about invariances.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Let's now take actual images and do something with these images.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
This is an image I took a while back in Amsterdam,

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
and it's interesting because there's a lot of interesting features

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
like these line features over here and possible corner features over there.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
In computer vision we don't use color images very much.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
We mostly use black and white images like this greyscale image over here,

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
which misses information from the original image,

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
but it turns out that greyscale is more robust to lighting variations than color is.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
That's a fairly common representation for images for computer vision.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
So a greyscale image is a matrix typically of several hundred rows

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
and several hundred columns

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
that has small values imprinted that correspond to the greyscale of a pixel.

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:03,000
These values scale between 0 and 255, where 255 is white and 0 is black.

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
You can see how this matrix is full of values that together compose the image.

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Here is a very small image of size 4 by 5,

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
and based on the numbers I put in, it feels like there's a transition going on.

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
At the top the image is relatively bright.

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
These have values close to 255.

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
And at the bottom it is relatively large.

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
This is way too small an image to recognize anything.

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Picture a matrix much, much larger than this,

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:37,000
yet an image that's still just a 2-dimensional matrix of singular brightness values.

24
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
At least a greyscale image is a matrix like this.

25
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
A color image would have 3 different values per pixel

26
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
which correspond to red, blue, or green or some other encoding of the color itself.

27
00:01:50,000 --> 99:59:59,999
But for now we're going to be content with greyscale images.
