00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,936
This next quiz is a bit tricky. It turns out that chez_bananas is actually a

2
00:00:03,936 --> 00:00:08,584
very yummy restaurant, I highly recommend it, especially the carrots. Now,

3
00:00:08,584 --> 00:00:13,461
without changing restaurant, your goal is to add code to get this behavior. So,

4
00:00:13,461 --> 00:00:17,304
we're going to create a new at restaurant object, we're going to have some code

5
00:00:17,304 --> 00:00:21,208
and then we're going to get the result of evaluating chez<u>bananas.is</u>yummy

6
00:00:21,209 --> 00:00:26,048
produces True. This is a little tricky, but if you get it, you'll understand a

7
00:00:26,048 --> 00:00:28,663
lot about what's going on with methods.
