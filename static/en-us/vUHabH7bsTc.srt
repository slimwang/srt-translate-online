00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The correct answer is the URL changes to include your text.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Let's take a look at that in the browser. Okay--so here we are.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
We have our text in our box, and we press enter.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Ah--what happened?

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Our URL changed, and you can see our parameter q--

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
which was the value of the name attribute--

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
equals Udacity--equals the text we typed in.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
We can put new text in the box, hit enter,

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
and we see that q equals our new text. Pretty neat.
