1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:05,330
The third and last criterion to examine has to do with concrete operations,

2
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:09,660
modelling abstract ones. That is, each concrete operation must

3
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:12,940
faithfully reflect the intent of the abstract specification.

4
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:16,570
You had to do your implementation right. And this criterion has two parts,

5
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:21,260
having to do with inputs and outputs to operations. That is to refine

6
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:25,600
operations, we must assure ourselves of two things. The implementation must be

7
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:30,380
able to handle all the imports described in the specification. And the outputs

8
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:34,580
produced by the operation, along with any changes made to class attributes or

9
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:37,940
other side effects, must satisfy the operation specification.
