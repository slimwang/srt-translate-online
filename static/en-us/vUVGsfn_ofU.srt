1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:04,322
The answer should be 5 rows. We'll always have the first one, and then each

2
00:00:04,322 --> 00:00:10,060
additional row is another 400 times root 3 meters of length. So, to get the

3
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:14,700
total number, we can do 4000 minus 800 over how much we need for another

4
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:22,068
additional row. So, 400 root 3, and then we add 1 because there's that first

5
00:00:22,068 --> 00:00:30,210
row that took up 800. This calculation would give us 5.61. But we said that we

6
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:34,095
couldn't have fractional rows. So, we just get 5. Let's generalize what we just

7
00:00:34,095 --> 00:00:36,804
did, if you already know the equation for the number of rows given the length

8
00:00:36,804 --> 00:00:41,456
of the field, write it down and skip to the next question. Based on what we did

9
00:00:41,456 --> 00:00:45,929
up here, the equation should be, rows equals the length, minus the diameter

10
00:00:45,929 --> 00:00:53,223
over the radius times the square root of 3 plus 1. Remember the radius was the

11
00:00:53,223 --> 00:00:59,165
400 and diameter would be 2 radius' or 800. And then once we do this

12
00:00:59,165 --> 00:01:04,006
calculation, we would drop the decimal. Save this, you're going to need it

13
00:01:04,006 --> 00:01:05,128
later.
