1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,500
In summary, partnering strategies are great.

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:09,920
But understand you're not a peer of these large companies.

3
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,860
And all the books and literature that talks about partnerships

4
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:18,810
very rarely addresses startup to large company partnerships.

5
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:22,080
These are asymmetrical relationships.

6
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:27,400
And so don't confuse partners that you need early on to address earlyvangelists

7
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:34,180
with the ones that you might need a year or 2 from now to address mainstream customers.

8
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:36,560
So remember, if you've been getting out of the building,

9
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:41,120
you actually found the early passionate customer segments

10
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,940
or people inside those segments that will buy your product

11
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:47,820
even unfinished or unbuilt or buggy as it is.

12
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:54,410
Understand what they need now and help them teach you what the mainstream will need later.

13
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:59,320
And so don't confuse big company partnering with startup strategy.

14
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:03,860
Find the partners that give you an unfair advantage.

15
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:08,290
And just keep in mind--and this really requires a bit of cynicism--

16
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:11,720
that you really don't matter to a large partner.

17
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:16,000
They matter enormously to you, but I would keep a jaded eye out

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,410
and understand what's in it for you to build your company

19
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:22,280
so that one day you're bigger than them.

20
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:27,180
One of the other advantages about talking to partners to keep in mind

21
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:29,900
is this is almost like dating.

22
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:33,420
While you're out there talking to them, understanding what resources,

23
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:37,920
what activities they could provide or what supply chain they could fulfill for you,

24
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:43,090
also understand that some of them might be your potential acquirer someday.

25
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:48,200
And so even if the relationships don't work out or the deals don't work out,

26
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,590
always be on your best behavior.

27
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:55,780
Always in fact make them wish, "Boy, this would be a great part of our company,"

28
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:58,510
because right now you might not want to be acquired,

29
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:01,660
but someday someone might want to come back when you're bigger

30
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:03,860
with an offer that you just couldn't refuse,

31
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:08,100
and you get to buy the house and the car and the airplane at the south of France,

32
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:11,730
and remember how great you were in those partnership discussions.

33
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:16,720
So partnerships can be strategic, they could be fun, they could be nerve-racking.

34
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,870
Understand they're an integral part of your business model and business model canvas.

35
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:22,800
Go out and talk to a ton of them.

36
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,870
And when you do, you'll understand how to use them

37
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:28,000
to make your startup into a large company.
