1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Let's look at what the forward Euler method does to this equation.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:11,000
X after the first step will be the initial value of x plus the time step

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
times the rate of change at the initial time plus the rate of change at times 0.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
What's the rate of change at times 0? It's -kx(0).

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
We can factor out x or 0 and end up with this expression.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
That's the result after the first times step.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The initial value gets multiplied by 1 minus step size times the constant that appears in the test equation.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Now, let's do the second step--it's x at the end of the previous step

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
plus h times the rate of change at that time or actually our estimate of that rate of change

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:53,000
at that time which would be -kx(h), again we can factor out and we can plug in the value of x(h)

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
from the first step, so we end up with (1-hk) times now x(h),

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:08,000
(1-hk) x(0) which is if we combine these two, (1-hk)² x(0)

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:16,000
and you see how this is going to proceed if you go to (3h), this will become (4h)^4 and so on.

14
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
The question was whether or not x is going to approach 0.

15
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:28,000
This boils down to whether or not (1-hk)ⁿ approaches 0 as n times to infinity.

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:37,000
So what happens to the nth power of (1-hk), we are interested in how large h the step size can be?

17
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
If the step size h gets large, the expression inside the parenthesis

18
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
becomes negative, we are subtracting from 1.

19
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
If we are subtracting more than 1, the inner term here gets negative.

20
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:57,000
So the question here is what happens to powers of negative numbers to some huge power.

21
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
As an example, what happens if the inner expression equals -2

22
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
and we take the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and so on power.

23
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:17,000
(-2)¹ is -2. (-2)² is 4. (-2)³ is -8. (-2)⁴ is 16 and so on which means that this expression,

24
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:23,000
the nth power would explode and this is precisely not what we want for a stable solution.

25
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:29,000
So let's try a different number. So what would happen if the inner expression was -0.9,

26
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:43,000
and we took powers of (-0.9). (-0.9)¹ is 0.9. (-0.9)² is 0.81. (-0.9)³ is -0.723. (-0.9)⁴ is 0.6561.

27
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Each time, we are losing 10% in magnitude but you see that the sign keeps changing,

28
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:55,000
minus, plus, minus, plus, so this indeed decays to 0 but in a strange fashion. It oscillates.

29
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
You may remember this behavior from the SEIR model that we simulated before.

30
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:07,000
If this expression would equal -0.99, it would still see decay with this sort of oscillation.

31
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:14,000
If it would equal -0.999, this would still work but become very, very slow.

32
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:20,000
So the threshold would be that (1-hk) is in the expression equals -1.

33
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:29,000
The threshold, it's 2/k. So the condition is h is smaller than 2/k for this power to decay to 0

34
00:03:29,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and for the forward Euler method to be stable.
