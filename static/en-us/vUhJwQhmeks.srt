1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:05,150
To help us understand dynamic range,
let's first define the term luminance.

2
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:11,310
Luminance is basically a measure of
the intensity of light per unit area.

3
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:15,050
And this is again,
kind of accounting for

4
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:17,720
also the light traveling
in a given direction.

5
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:22,300
So any time it, light is hitting any
surface area, the direction it's coming

6
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:27,120
in from, and the luminous intensity
per unit square area of that

7
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:30,830
region is what we're looking for, and
that's what the measure of luminance is.

8
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:36,410
And it's ca, measured in candela per
meter squared, cd over m squared.

9
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:42,630
To help us quantify this, let's look
at the whole range of luminance.

10
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:47,442
Now I know we've, in the past, always
looked at a black and white image or

11
00:00:47,442 --> 00:00:52,660
a range of zero to one, or zero to 50,
to 255 in a different set of numbers.

12
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:57,300
But now, we're going to look at it in
terms of luminance, on a surface, or

13
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,270
an object, or a scene.

14
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:01,270
And in this case,
let's look at these values.

15
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:04,420
And again basically,
I'm showing you that this is a log plot,

16
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:09,710
going from eight, six, four, two, zero,
minus ten, minus four, and minus six.

17
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:11,940
So, of course, that's why it
kind of has a linear thing.

18
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:15,090
But these are again,
numbers that are much more in detail,

19
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:18,020
kind of showing you things about
what's happening in an image.

20
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:23,500
And I've just now marked in
this range basically in indoor,

21
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:27,020
sunlight, sunlight is much brighter, and

22
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:29,880
in fact, there's even something
much even brighter than that.

23
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,810
Indoor images would have
these type of ranges here.

24
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:37,070
So this point is basically
showing sunlight.

25
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:38,450
This would be indoor.

26
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:40,450
These are the kind of images,
we looked at it.

27
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:44,080
If it, this scene was lit by just
moonlight, directly captured,

28
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,380
that's what we would have.

29
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:47,950
And, of course, this is starlight.

30
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:48,960
Now, one thing to note,

31
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,810
the human vision system,
can measure static contrast ratio.

32
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:58,580
That is, being able to kind of see the
range at any moment, when I'm looking at

33
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:04,230
a scene, are from hundred to one,
so ten raised two to one.

34
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:07,818
And again, the human eye,
in a static case,

35
00:02:07,818 --> 00:02:12,190
can also adjust itself
by about 6.5 f-stops.

36
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:15,700
Remember the term of f-stops,
when we looked at from the camera where,

37
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,530
when we actually looked
at what were the f-stops.

38
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:20,060
And we looked at a variety
of ways of what of happens.

39
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:23,810
And that basically means is, how wide
the aperture is opening up that allows

40
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:27,780
us to capture more light, or less light,
depending on the size of the aperture.

41
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:30,210
Now, I do categorize this
in two different ways.

42
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:33,000
One, I'm talking about
static contrast ratio.

43
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,290
Now, another one is
dynamic contrast ratio.

44
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:38,240
That is meant for
if the scene is dynamically changing.

45
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:41,970
And in this case, our human vision
system can actually do much better.

46
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:48,800
And in fact, we see a range from 1
million, ten raised to six, to one.

47
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,240
And basically, this can be captured
with about 20 different f-stops.

48
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,050
So you notice,

49
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:59,080
the range goes from 6.5 to 20,
when we go from static to dynamic.

50
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:02,015
Now the big difference that I want to
point out between static contrast and

51
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:04,203
the static scene basically is,
nothing is changing.

52
00:03:04,203 --> 00:03:09,060
With dynamic is when the, the
illumination in the scene is changing.

53
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:11,510
Now this could be because the scene
is dynamically changing, or

54
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:14,850
somebody is changing the lighting
conditions, and this could be again,

55
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:17,160
the sun is moving around,
there's shadows and stuff like that.

56
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,240
So that's the difference.

57
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:21,280
Of course, human eye system,
as we've talked about before,

58
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,140
is a pretty impressive
bit of technology, and

59
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:27,040
it can adapt quite quickly
to a variety of shades.

60
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,775
And again, something to think about
when you start thinking about the human

61
00:03:29,775 --> 00:03:30,670
saccade system,

62
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:34,800
and I encourage you to look at that
kind of stuff on the web, because it

63
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:38,180
allows you to kind of adapt very quickly
from one brightness to the other.

64
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:42,940
Now partly what we are trying to do with
this representation of dynamic range,

65
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:47,810
is to create images that will allow
us to actually capture dynamic range

66
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:49,960
in one static image.

67
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:53,160
That actually is somewhat similar
to what our human vision can,

68
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,300
system can do.

69
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:57,700
By moving our eyes around in saccades
and stuff like that, we can see a lot of

70
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:02,840
dynamic range, and our eyes adapt very
much to bright and low light situations.

71
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,360
And we can see much more detail.

72
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,690
Of course,
cameras at present cannot do this, and

73
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:09,930
that's one of the questions for
computational photography is,

74
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:14,650
how do we kind of, bring in the
computation to make it do the adaptation

75
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:17,540
to what it's seeing in the light,
and being able to capture images?

76
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:20,220
And of course, at the end of it,
we want to create sometimes a,

77
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:22,360
just a static image that captures it.

78
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,930
You'll see more examples of this
as we continue talking more.
