00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:06,775
That means that in terms of x, we remember x is the depth of her stage. Our

2
00:00:06,775 --> 00:00:12,021
equation for reverb time is this: T equals 0.322 times 6 x squared, times x

3
00:00:12,021 --> 00:00:18,634
plus 10, all over 22 x squared plus 100 x. This is a rational function. Now, as

4
00:00:18,634 --> 00:00:21,672
we've done with other rational functions, let's factor the numerator and

5
00:00:21,672 --> 00:00:25,812
denominator. Write the fully factored forms of each side of the fraction here

6
00:00:25,812 --> 00:00:29,640
and here. I'd also like you to make a note of any values of x for which the

7
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,989
function isn't defined.
