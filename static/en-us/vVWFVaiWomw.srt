00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:03,170
Now that you know a few design principles, and

2
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:06,310
how to compose graphics, let's go through a few different narrative

3
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:10,390
structures that you can use to walk your viewers through your visualization.

4
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:11,970
>> In addition to narrative structures,

5
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:15,150
I'll teach you about the data collection process and data processing.

6
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:17,580
I'll also show you some examples of bias, and

7
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:19,269
what you should avoid when creating graphics.

8
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:23,720
>> In all the visualizations we've created and encountered in this class,

9
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:27,560
one thing that was absent, was any idea of context or narrative.

10
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:30,610
Often when you're reading a newspaper, a blog post, or

11
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:34,730
an article, there's some story that connects all the pieces together.

12
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:37,540
Think of narrative as the invisible string that ties the frames of

13
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:41,650
a movie together, or the binding of a book that glues the pages together.

14
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:44,460
Let's walk through how journalists approach this problem and

15
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:45,560
create stories of their own.
