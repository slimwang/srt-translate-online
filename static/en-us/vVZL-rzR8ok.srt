1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,290
So, let's look at an example of fabrication costs.

2
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:07,893
Suppose that the cost of manufacturing a wafer is $5,000. So,

3
00:00:07,893 --> 00:00:12,970
we pay $5,000 to manufacture a whole wafer and cut it up into chips.

4
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:16,630
Let's consider what happens when you have some really small chips so

5
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:21,500
that we can fit 400 of them on a wafer. And then we want to manufacture large

6
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:26,430
chips that are four times the size of the small chips. So, now you would think.

7
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:32,369
That we would have 100 of those on our wafer. But because the wafer is round and

8
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:36,590
the chips are square, we lose some chips along the edge.

9
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:42,040
So let's say that we can fit only 96 of these large chips on our wafer.

10
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:46,940
And finally we will consider huge chips that are four times again. So

11
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:50,699
they're four times. The size of the large chip and

12
00:00:50,699 --> 00:00:55,982
then 24 of them would be a quarter of this. But because, again,

13
00:00:55,982 --> 00:01:00,841
the wafer is round and the chip is square we lose some more along the edges. So

14
00:01:00,841 --> 00:01:05,110
let's say only 20 of them can fit on a wafer. And

15
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:09,280
let us also suppose that there are 10 defects on each wafer.

16
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:14,430
What we want to compute is what's the manufacturing cost of a small large and

17
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:19,170
huge chip. The chip cost will be the $5,000 for

18
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:25,120
a wafer divided by how many good chips we get per wafer.

19
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:30,578
So now for our small chips, what we get. Is that the cost is equal to

20
00:01:30,578 --> 00:01:37,360
$5,000 divided by, we have 400 chips on a wafer.

21
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:43,520
But we lose 10 to defects, so we really have $5,000 for 390 chips.

22
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:50,670
And that gives us a cost of $12.80 to manufacture a working chip.

23
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:57,330
For a large chip, we get the cost to be $5,000 divided

24
00:01:57,330 --> 00:02:02,540
by 96 of them fit on a chip. But again, these defects are going to be on

25
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:09,210
the wafer, and they will affect 10 of our chips, so we lose 10 to the defects.

26
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:13,360
So we end up we paying $5,000 for manufacturing and

27
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:19,690
get only 86 working chips. So we get $58.20 as the cost of our chips,

28
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:25,340
so note that our chip is only four times the size of a small chip.

29
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:31,270
But the cost is about five times the cost of a smaller chip. And finally for

30
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:36,490
our huge chip. The cost is going to be $5,000,

31
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:42,328
we get only 20 chips fabricated. And now there are ten defects on a wafer.

32
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:46,894
But with chips this big, it seems likely that maybe two of these defects

33
00:02:46,894 --> 00:02:51,464
are going to end up on the same chip. So instead of losing ten chips to defects,

34
00:02:51,464 --> 00:02:56,690
because each defect effects a whole chip. Let's say that we only lose

35
00:02:56,690 --> 00:03:02,450
nine chips because of this defense. So we put in $5,000 and manufacture only

36
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:08,140
11 chips that work. This is much more than four times the cost of a large chip.

37
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:12,680
This means really that if you're fabricating chips that are really large,.

38
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:17,330
Any slight increase or decrease in chip size is going to significantly change

39
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:21,530
the cost. We have seen that here the difference was five times instead of four.

40
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:26,560
Here the difference is almost ten times instead of four. So

41
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:31,790
if this is what manufacturing cost look like and if we combine this

42
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:36,340
with what Moore's law gives us. Which is we can fit more stuff on the same chip.

43
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:41,955
We really have two choices when we get a generation of Moore's Law to play for

44
00:03:41,955 --> 00:03:47,275
us. One, we can have a smaller chip that does exactly the same things that

45
00:03:47,275 --> 00:03:53,113
a larger chip could do previously because now we can make things smaller. And,

46
00:03:53,113 --> 00:03:59,470
as you can see, getting things smaller gives us much lower cost.

47
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:04,170
So one way of benefiting from Moore's Law, is to getting smaller, and

48
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:08,160
thus a lot cheaper than before while keeping the same functionality.

49
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:12,580
The other way of benefiting from Moore's Law, is to build something new that has

50
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:18,029
the same area as old thing. And that means that we get something faster, and

51
00:04:18,029 --> 00:04:23,600
more capable for the same cost that the old thing had. So,

52
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,820
if we are interested in high performance processors, typically we will do this.

53
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:31,580
But if we are interested in doing something that could not be done before,

54
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:35,960
then this is what we usually benefit from. Take a cell phone for example.

55
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:42,140
Early on, what we wanted to put in a cellphone, could not be very smart,

56
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:47,370
so we had, non-smartphones. Eventually, the processor that would be

57
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:52,560
required to make a smartphone, became small enough. To put in a cell phone and

58
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,910
also cheap enough so that we can afford it, and that's when we

59
00:04:55,910 --> 00:05:00,530
started having cell phones. Similar things occurred with digital watches, and

60
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:06,460
all sort of things where eventually what we want will fit

61
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:10,900
in where we want it. It's just a matter of how long do we need to wait for it,

62
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:14,980
because of this, because. Whatever functionality we need,

63
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:19,130
will eventually be cheap enough and small enough to fit.
