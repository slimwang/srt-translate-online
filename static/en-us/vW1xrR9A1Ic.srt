00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,469
There are all sorts of different ways to view the world. Here are three, a

2
00:00:03,469 --> 00:00:07,739
fish-eye lens, a perspective view and an orthographic view. These are all

3
00:00:07,739 --> 00:00:10,978
different types of projections. A projection maps locations in the world to

4
00:00:10,978 --> 00:00:14,637
locations on the screen. A fish-eye projection is possible to simulate in

5
00:00:14,637 --> 00:00:17,910
computer graphics. Hey, just about anything can be simulated in computer

6
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:21,324
graphics, but it's rarely used in practice. These other two projections are

7
00:00:21,324 --> 00:00:24,574
more popular for a number of reasons. First they act similarly to a how a

8
00:00:24,574 --> 00:00:28,655
camera captures a picture. So we're used to them. Straight lines stay straight

9
00:00:28,655 --> 00:00:32,246
unlike a fisheye lense. All in all the math is simpler. A perspective view

10
00:00:32,246 --> 00:00:36,469
we'll usually associate with seeing the world. Distant objects get smaller. An

11
00:00:36,469 --> 00:00:40,034
orthographic view is much more common in design software. In an orthographic

12
00:00:40,034 --> 00:00:43,512
view objects do not get smaller as they get more distant. Parallel lines in the

13
00:00:43,512 --> 00:00:46,328
real world stay parallel in this kind of view as opposed to perspective where

14
00:00:46,328 --> 00:00:47,739
they do not.
