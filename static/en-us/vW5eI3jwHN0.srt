1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:04,180
The goal number one is to reduce
latency, and this implies that we want

2
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:07,830
to try to execute the atomic
operation as soon as possible.

3
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:12,790
As a result, the locking operation will
immediately incur an atomic operation

4
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:17,440
and that can potentially create some
additional contention on the network.

5
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:21,610
Therefore one conflicts with three
is one of the correct answers.

6
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:26,480
Similarly with two, if we want to reduce
the waiting time to delay, then we have

7
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:31,250
to make sure we're continuously spinning
on the lock as long as it is not

8
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:36,180
available, so that we can detect as soon
as possible that the lock is freed and

9
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:37,950
we can try to acquire it.

10
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:43,000
Again, this will create contention and
so two is conflicting with three.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,960
As for any conflicts between
reducing latency and

12
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,340
reducing waiting time or delay, it is
hard to answer this in a general case.

13
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:53,820
It will really depend on from
one algorithm to another.

14
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:57,489
So we're not going to mark this
answer as a conflicting one.
