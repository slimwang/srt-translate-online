1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,480
So, in summary, I'd like to say just a little

2
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:05,130
bit more about correcting data. The types of corrections that

3
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:07,660
we typically make to any data set that we're cleaning,

4
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:10,960
usually involve one or more of the following. We're going

5
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:15,410
to be removing typographical errors, or correcting them. There will

6
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:18,450
often be a component in cleaning where we're validating against

7
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:21,610
a known list of entities. We will frequently be cross

8
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:25,270
checking our data with a validated data set of some kind.

9
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:27,665
We might be doing data enhancement, and frequently

10
00:00:27,665 --> 00:00:31,170
are, where we're making data a little more complete

11
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:34,200
by adding some related information. So for example, we

12
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,320
might have a username, an email address, and first

13
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,590
and last name for every entry in a

14
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:44,270
record set. And as part of our cleaning process

15
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:47,900
or part of our process before, we analyze data.

16
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:50,610
We're going to integrate each of those records with

17
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:54,220
marketing data for each person on employer and

18
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:58,220
job title et cetera. Another common thing we do

19
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:01,030
in cleaning data is harmonizing the data. So for

20
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:04,230
example in this case, we would be transforming all

21
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:06,890
abbreviations for street and road to say for

22
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:09,660
example, their full names, or vise versa. Maybe we're

23
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:12,700
going the other direction. Likewise with directions. N and

24
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:16,810
W become north and west, et cetera in addresses.

25
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:18,590
We might also be changing our data set so

26
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:22,380
that it uses a new standard for some set of

27
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:25,250
codes that it contains. So for example, we might

28
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:28,700
be transforming our data set to, instead of two-digit country

29
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:32,420
codes, use three-digit codes by simply mapping each of

30
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:36,110
the two-digit codes onto the appropriate three-digit codes. These are

31
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:38,210
some of the common types of tasks that we

32
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:41,990
do when cleaning data, and again, it's very situation specific.

33
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:44,970
So what we've tried to do throughout this lesson, and what we're going to do

34
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:46,470
in the problem set, is give you

35
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:49,570
examples from a few different situations, to give

36
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:51,420
you some practice with cleaning, so that

37
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:53,640
you have some concrete examples in mind, when

38
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,280
you get into your own data wrangling tasks

39
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,910
where you need to do some data cleaning.
