1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:02,410
So what are the learning
goals of this class?

2
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:05,070
When we discuss our classes, learning
goals are the things that we want you to

3
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:07,030
know by the end of the class.

4
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:09,560
In this class, the learning goal is
really just that you would know enough

5
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:13,250
information to contribute to
the field of educational technology.

6
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:14,640
But of course,
no one can know everything and

7
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,690
no one can contribute
in every possible way.

8
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:19,230
So what you actually need to know will
be dependent on what you want to do

9
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:20,370
in this class.

10
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:22,370
You might want to design
educational technology.

11
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:25,440
In which case you really need to know
the current tools out there to address

12
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:26,740
the problem you're
interested in addressing.

13
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:27,930
As well as techniques for

14
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:31,650
designing sound pedagogical
strategies inside technology.

15
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:33,120
You might want to do
research in this field.

16
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,850
In which case you really need to
know the research methodologies of

17
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:36,900
educational technology.

18
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:39,420
As well as, what some different
communities out there have already

19
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:41,530
established in these fields.

20
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:44,090
You might want to do a mixture of both,
you might want to do user testing.

21
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:46,261
In which case you need some
research methodology but

22
00:00:46,261 --> 00:00:48,000
some understanding of the tools as well.

23
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,610
Or maybe you're interested in
the broader issues of educational

24
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:53,840
technology, how it intersects with
culture or personal identity.

25
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:54,680
In which case you really need

26
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:57,740
to understand what those
community's theories right now are.

27
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:01,790
And the different strategies they go
about to understand those phenomena.

28
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:04,750
So what really matters in this class
is knowing what you need to know

29
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:06,670
to contribute in the way
you want to contribute.
