1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:05,689
But first let us look at examples of the three kinds of semantic categories that

2
00:00:05,689 --> 00:00:11,250
by point to. So here is a sentence in which by points to an agent. That

3
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:15,820
was written be Ashok. Actually, this particular sentence was written by David.

4
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:19,990
The second sentence, David went to New York by train, here by is pointing to

5
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:25,060
a conveyance. David stood by the statue. Here, by it is pointing to a location.

6
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:29,700
By the statue. So the use of the word by helped us, in that it

7
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:33,950
constrained the interpretation of Ashok to either an agent, conveyance or

8
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:38,260
location. It by itself doesnâ€™t tell us whether Ashok is an agent or

9
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:42,550
a conveyance or location. We need some additional knowledge. Let us suppose that

10
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:46,510
the agent has an ontology of the world. The term ontology initially comes from

11
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:51,620
philosophy where it means the nature of reality. An artificial intelligence

12
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:56,190
determine ontology often reference to the conceptualization of the world.

13
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:59,990
The categories and terms of which I specify the world.

14
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:04,349
These categories have become the vocabulary of the knowledge representation. So

15
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:07,580
let us supposed that the agent has this ontology of the world.

16
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:11,240
The world is composed of things, and things can be agents or objects or

17
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:17,350
locations. Agents are people, and Ashok and David are examples of agents.

18
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:21,470
Objects can be conveyances. And trains and cars are examples of conveyances.

19
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:25,820
Obviously this is a very small part of someone's ontology about the world.

20
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:30,800
Now this ontology helps us decide that Ashok, in the first sentence,

21
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:35,050
is an agent. Let's see how. Here we have by Ashok, and

22
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:38,450
we know from the prepositional constraints that by can refer to an agent,

23
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:43,050
conveyance, or location. So the question now becomes, is Ashok an agent,

24
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:46,970
Ashok a conveyance, or Ashok a location? We can look into this ontology.

25
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:49,790
Ashok is people, which is an agent. So now we know,

26
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:54,970
that Ashok must be an agent. Similar the second sentence. Train can be an agent,

27
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:59,440
conveyance or location. Let's look at our ontology. A train is a conveyance. So

28
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:02,470
now we know the train is a conveyance. Similarly for statue.

29
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:06,730
Statue in this case specifies a location. Note that this analysis applies to

30
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:10,479
different prepositions, not just to by. Supposing this first sentence was,

31
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:15,840
That was written with Ashok. In which case, this preposition with will point to

32
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,440
Ashok either being a coagent or being an instrument. So again,

33
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,130
we now know that Ashok is a coagent in the sentence which

34
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:26,530
contain the preposition with. There is another important thing to note here.

35
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:29,500
Initially, when we were give this sentence, David went to New York by train,

36
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:34,010
we started doing bottom-up processing. David was a noun, went was a verb. But

37
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:37,790
pretty soon we shifted to top-down processing. As an example,

38
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:40,630
you already have this background knowledge, and this background knowledge tells

39
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:45,480
us in a top-down manner that by, here, can refer to an agent, a conveyance, or

40
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:49,450
a location. We also have this additional background knowledge, and

41
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:52,660
this background knowledge tells us that in this particular sentence.

42
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:56,830
The train describes frame to a conveyance, because train is a conveyance in this

43
00:02:56,830 --> 00:03:01,030
ontology. So low-level bottom up processing generates queues,

44
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:06,670
which access probes into memory. Memory then returns knowledge like this,

45
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:10,570
and the processing becomes top down. The top down processing tells us how to

46
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:13,700
interpret the various words in this sentence, how to make sense of this story.
