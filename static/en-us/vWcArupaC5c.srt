1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,368
Continuing along the same vein, let's play around with another similar problem.

2
00:00:04,368 --> 00:00:08,501
This time, can you tell me what the solutions to x to the fourth equals 1 are?

3
00:00:08,501 --> 00:00:12,724
I'll remind you that we saw earlier that i to the fourth equals 1. So that gives

4
00:00:12,724 --> 00:00:16,785
you one answer. And also tell you that there are several that belong in this

5
00:00:16,785 --> 00:00:21,045
box. Think really carefully about what these could be, and seperate your answers

6
00:00:21,045 --> 00:00:23,291
with commas once you've figured them out.
