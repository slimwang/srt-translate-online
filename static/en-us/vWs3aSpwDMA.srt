00:00:00,004 --> 00:00:04,948
a equals 7 for this equation. Great work if you found this answer. This

2
00:00:04,948 --> 00:00:08,512
equation had two radicals. So, we want to split them up, so one radical is on

3
00:00:08,512 --> 00:00:12,420
each side of the equals sign. We add this square root to both sides of the

4
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:16,980
equation to get our new one. Now we can undo these square roots by raising both

5
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:23,727
sides to the second power. We'll have 4a minus 3 equal to 2a plus 11. We solved

6
00:00:23,727 --> 00:00:27,753
this linear equation by subtracting 2a from both sides, then adding 3 and

7
00:00:27,753 --> 00:00:33,464
dividing by 2. This gives us a is equal to 7. Now, like every problem before,

8
00:00:33,464 --> 00:00:37,690
you want to check this answer in the original equation. We plug in the value of

9
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:42,416
7 in for a, here and here. And then we get the expression, root 24 minus root

10
00:00:42,416 --> 00:00:48,344
24, on the left-hand side. We know this equals 0. So, yes, 0 does equal 0,

11
00:00:48,344 --> 00:00:50,980
which means our solution checks.
