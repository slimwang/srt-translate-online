00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,940
Let's look at the solution to our RAID
0 quiz where we have an array of four

2
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:09,230
disks, and for one disk we know
the capacity, throughput, and MTTF.

3
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:15,590
In RAID 0, we're striping the data
across all the disks with no redundancy.

4
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:22,570
So we can use a capacity of all four
disks, and thus get 800 GB in capacity.

5
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:27,490
If we spread the read and write load
evenly across the disks, then one disk

6
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:31,440
being able to support 10 megabytes per
second and four disks being used in

7
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:36,486
parallel like this gives us a throughput
of 40 megabytes per second.

8
00:00:36,486 --> 00:00:42,356
And finally, if the MTTF for
one disk is 100,000 hours,

9
00:00:42,356 --> 00:00:48,660
the expected MTTF for the whole array
is going to be a quarter of this,

10
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:54,009
if they are in RAID 0, so
we will get 25,000 hours.

11
00:00:54,009 --> 00:00:57,003
This MTTF ends up being almost 12 years.

12
00:00:57,003 --> 00:01:00,120
This one is almost three years.

13
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:04,800
If we plan to replace our array after
something like five or six years,

14
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:09,170
know that it can still fail
within the five or six years, but

15
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:12,980
on average it's going
to last about 12 years.

16
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:18,820
However, here our average array is going
to fail during the five to six years.

17
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:20,590
So obviously with such a low MTTF,

18
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:24,230
we should not have used four
disks in RAID 0 like this.
