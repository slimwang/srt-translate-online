Here's our last motion problem for this lesson. Olivia can ride her bike 4 mph

2
00:00:03,904 --> 00:00:09,915
faster than Terrance. If Olivia can go 30 miles in the same time that Terrance

3
00:00:09,915 --> 00:00:14,912
can go 15 miles, what are their speeds? Again I think its best to use a table

4
00:00:14,912 --> 00:00:19,225
for a problem like this. So let's organize our information. We'll have Olivia

5
00:00:19,225 --> 00:00:23,554
and her distance, rate and time. And then we'll have Terrance and his distance,

6
00:00:23,554 --> 00:00:27,788
his rate and his time. So let's see if you can fill in all the missing parts to

7
00:00:27,788 --> 00:00:33,670
our table. Put in the correct number or the correct expression in each part.

8
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:37,718
Also be sure that you use x for your variable. Think carefully about which item

9
00:00:37,718 --> 00:00:40,700
should be the variable here. And good luck!
