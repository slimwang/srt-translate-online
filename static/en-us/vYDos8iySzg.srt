1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:02,600
So here again you choose
the correct answer.

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:07,970
The question is saying many online
banking systems including the one I use.

3
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:13,620
Actually they send you a pin when you
login as a SMS to your smartphone.

4
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:16,180
And they ask you to type that pin.

5
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:18,640
So you had to provide
that pin in addition to

6
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,560
The password that you might have.

7
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:24,690
So is this an example of authentication
with something you have or

8
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:26,530
something you are?

9
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:27,960
So which case it is.
