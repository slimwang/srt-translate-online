Hi Michael.

2
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:01,890
>> Hey Charles. How you been?

3
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:04,120
>> I've been doing just fine. How've you been?

4
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:07,110
>> Good. It's been a while. I understand you went to Africa.

5
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:10,280
>> I went to Africa. The entire continent, or at least parts of it.

6
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:11,710
>> How's Africa?

7
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:13,550
>> It's fine. It's, warm.

8
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:14,984
>> The entire continent?

9
00:00:14,984 --> 00:00:18,380
>> [LAUGH] The entire continent. Or at least Kenya and Nigeria.

10
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:18,540
>> Okay.

11
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:20,158
>> Particularly in Nigeria. Which was

12
00:00:20,158 --> 00:00:24,442
80 something degrees and 4,000% humidity. [LAUGH]

13
00:00:24,442 --> 00:00:25,477
>> So, do you want to do a shout

14
00:00:25,477 --> 00:00:27,280
out to any of, any of your friends from there?

15
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:29,600
>> Yeah, I'd like to say hi to Chairman and I'd like to say hi

16
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:33,900
to Prof. Oh, and Good Times. I would like to say hi to Good Times. He

17
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:39,360
was awesome. Okay, so Michael. I am back now so that we can talk about the

18
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:44,510
last little section. That we're going to do in this class, and it's game theory.

19
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:47,350
>> That sounds cool. What does that have to do with machine learning?

20
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:48,620
>> So that's an interesting question because,

21
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:50,530
in fact, game theory comes from a tradition

22
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:54,060
way outside of machine learning in A.I. but you'll see

23
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:55,570
in a moment why it is I care about game

24
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:58,900
theory, and really this is a very natural extension to

25
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:01,240
all the stuff we've been talking about with reinforcement learning.

26
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:04,410
>> Interesting. Are we talking about games like Monopoly?

27
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:07,490
>> In some sense, we are. Because all of life is like

28
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:09,770
Monopoly. So in fact, what is game theory? Maybe that's what we can

29
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:11,480
do. We can just try to define game theory, and maybe it'll

30
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:14,840
be clear why it is we're worried about this at all. Seem fair?

31
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:15,310
>> Yeah.

32
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:15,790
>> Okay.
