1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,840
It's this third option that
captures the necessary steps.

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,800
In the first line we deque the cell.

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:10,080
This requires a cast because the method
returns an object of type AnyObject.

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,030
In the second line we use the
indexPath.row value as an index into our

5
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:18,470
array in order to get the string that
corresponds to the row in question.

6
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:23,000
Then we use that string to set
the text of the label in the cell.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,790
And finally we return the cell.

8
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:27,550
And notice that we've
written this method so

9
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:31,140
that it will work with any
value of index passed out row.

10
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:34,270
Next up, you'll get a chance to practice
your table view skills with a new

11
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:35,920
project named, Doe, Rae, Me.
