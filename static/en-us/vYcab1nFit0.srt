00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:02,828
That wraps up the first
iteration of Gift Maker.

2
00:00:02,828 --> 00:00:05,992
Now you have hard evidence of your
ability to read Objective C and

3
00:00:05,992 --> 00:00:08,039
migrate features to Swift.

4
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:09,060
Show off your skills and

5
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:12,598
get a few laughs by sharing the gifts
made with your app on social media.

6
00:00:12,598 --> 00:00:16,090
Next up, we'll make Gift Maker more
professional by adding the ability to

7
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:17,260
save and persist data.
