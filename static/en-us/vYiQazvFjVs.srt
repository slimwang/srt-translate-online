So far, we have discussed disorders that affect both thought and behavior.

00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:08,589
However, there're some disorders that actually take on bodily or physical form

3
00:00:08,589 --> 00:00:14,414
and actually mimic diseases. This is called Somatic Symptom Disorder. Somatic

00:00:14,414 --> 00:00:18,836
Symptom Disorder used to be called hypochondriasys and is occurs when a person

00:00:18,836 --> 00:00:23,459
complains of multiple physical disorders that cause distress and distruption of

6
00:00:23,459 --> 00:00:30,334
a person's life. And persists for at least 6 months. According to the APA,

00:00:30,334 --> 00:00:34,736
there are two main criteria for diagnosis. First, one or more distressing

00:00:34,736 --> 00:00:40,410
somatic systems that disrupt daily living. And second, excessive thoughts,

00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:45,310
feelings or behaviors related to bodily symptoms. Approximately 5 to 7% of US

10
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:51,441
adults experience Somatic Symptom Disorder. A very similar disorder is known as

11
00:00:51,441 --> 00:00:56,494
Illness Anxiety Disorder. And it also involves a preoccupation and anxiety over

12
00:00:56,494 --> 00:01:00,200
having illnesses. But without any of the actual symptoms.
