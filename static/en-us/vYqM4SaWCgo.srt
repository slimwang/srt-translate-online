00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,643
We know a positive 3 should go here, since 3 times 3x is equal to 9x. Remember,

2
00:00:05,643 --> 00:00:11,403
to find this number we can also divide 9x, this first term, by the first term of

3
00:00:11,403 --> 00:00:17,079
our divisor, 3x, 9x divided by 3x is positive 3. 3 Times 3x is positive 9x, and

4
00:00:17,079 --> 00:00:22,518
3 times negative 2 is negative 6. Now we subtract the 9 x and the negative 6,

5
00:00:22,518 --> 00:00:28,371
which changes both of the signs. This leaves us with 0 as the remainder. So 4x

6
00:00:28,371 --> 00:00:34,451
plus 3 is the quotient, our answer, when we divide this polynomial by 3x minus

7
00:00:34,451 --> 00:00:34,706
2.
