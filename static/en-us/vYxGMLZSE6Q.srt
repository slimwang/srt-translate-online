00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:05,450
So my name is Gabe Savo, I work at Victor, a sub user data scientist. And I

2
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:08,960
actually come from a background that's, that's more towards

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,480
natural sense, sciences. I did statistical physics, I have

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,300
a PhD in statistical physics. And anything that goes

5
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:19,270
with that, obviously, I was looking at like a

6
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:22,490
lot of big, big systems that that kind of.

7
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:25,520
Emerge as an interaction of, of very small very

8
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:30,810
small entities composing of these systems. And

9
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:34,546
and later on I, I did complex network

10
00:00:34,546 --> 00:00:36,950
research. So that means that we have interactions

11
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:39,100
again. As in this, in this, imagine like

12
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:41,400
a big gas composed of molecules. But

13
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,920
instead here we have like, the humans interacting

14
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,220
with, with each other through social networks. Through

15
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:50,560
mobile communication networks. So that was the main

16
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:51,970
focus of my research all year.
