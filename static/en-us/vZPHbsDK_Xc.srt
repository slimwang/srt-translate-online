00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The common answer here is 5,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
although I realize many, many different answers are possible,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
and there is clearly no single answer that is really correct.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
But 5 is my favorite.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
It's the 3 kinematic state variables, and in addition we care about velocities,

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
so there is formal velocity of the vehicle itself

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
and the faster the vehicle moves, the further it is going to advance in a max timestep.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
There is also something called a yaw rate.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Yaw is one way to name the heading of the car,

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
the orientation of the car, or the bearing as some people call it.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The rate is the change over time.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
This car will not just move forward. It will also turn.

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
That turn has a velocity, and the velocity is often called "yaw rate."

14
00:00:42,000 --> 99:59:59,999
We're going to talk about this in a few minutes.
