Let's consider one of these points of intersection, the one between this new

pink line and this light blue line. If we call the point where they intersect p,

00:00:10,487 --> 00:00:15,425
then what two equations can we use the coordinates of point p to relate to one

00:00:15,437 --> 00:00:19,050
another? Please fill in those two equations down here.
