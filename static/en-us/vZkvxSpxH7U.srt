1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:03,969
At this point in the process you might
be thinking, all right I'm ready to go.

2
00:00:03,969 --> 00:00:06,660
Let's do this.
But there might be a small voice

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:10,610
in the back of your head or perhaps
a very loud one that's saying, wait.

4
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:12,190
I'm not a graphic designer.

5
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:13,490
I'm not an artist.

6
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:16,950
How am I going to make this app actually
look good so people want to use it?

7
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:18,420
To which I say, don't worry.

8
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:21,940
There's a lot of great services out
there that provide high quality

9
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:25,070
images and graphics that you
can use in your own app.

10
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:28,040
First, you have your basic
Google image search.

11
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:31,910
Now anything that you search here
will bring up a lot of results.

12
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:36,550
So you'll need to be wary of
any copyright restrictions.

13
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:42,020
But, given the right search terms,
you can find some real and free gems.

14
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:49,140
iStock photo and 99 Designs are also
great options if you're looking for

15
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:51,690
more professional high quality graphics.

16
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:54,480
However, these services
do cost a bit of money,

17
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,149
but they're usually pretty reasonable.

18
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:01,530
Maybe there are other services out there
that you've found that you are going to

19
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:03,080
use in your app.

20
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,000
If you find those,

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,100
I encourage you to share them with
your fellow classmates on the forum.

22
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:08,890
I'll actually be interested to see them,
too.
