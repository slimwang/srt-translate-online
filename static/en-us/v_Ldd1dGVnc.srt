One common way of giving a cartoon like appearance to a surface is to give it

2
00:00:03,044 --> 00:00:07,320
two or more shades of the same color. For example, in this drawing the sheep's

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:11,268
wool has just two tones, light and dark. You're going to do the same sort of

4
00:00:11,268 --> 00:00:14,690
thing with the diffuse shader we just described. The idea is to modify the

5
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:18,068
diffuse component. In the diffuse shader code we computed this value by taking

6
00:00:18,068 --> 00:00:21,954
the dot product of the normal and the light. Instead of using the diffuse

7
00:00:21,954 --> 00:00:26,200
component for the shade, we really want to identify two zones. Light and dark.

8
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,972
If the normal is pointing some fair bit towards the light, consider the area

9
00:00:28,972 --> 00:00:33,407
lit. Otherwise, it's dark. Take this sphere as an example. Normally we clamp

10
00:00:33,407 --> 00:00:37,103
the diffuse term at zero and not let it go negative. Above zero and the light

11
00:00:37,103 --> 00:00:41,021
has greater and greater contribution as the dot product increases. This is

12
00:00:41,021 --> 00:00:44,896
realistic, but we can do whatever we want in the shader. One idea to get a two

13
00:00:44,896 --> 00:00:49,195
tone effect is define a critical angle, essentially a dot product value. Below

14
00:00:49,195 --> 00:00:53,379
this value will make the surface uniformly dark, otherwise it's fully lit.
