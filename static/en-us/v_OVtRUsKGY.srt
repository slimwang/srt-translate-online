1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,390
So let's take a look at channel economics, but this time assume you are in

2
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:13,430
original equipment manufacture and your product becomes some other customer's cost of goods.

3
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:23,980
So let's assume this diagram on the top is a laptop computer sold for a computer reseller channel.

4
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:32,920
And let's say this laptop sells for $3000 and like any other channel,

5
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:37,090
the end user assumes they get a discount.

6
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:42,750
The reseller is taking a profit but gee that reseller was actually buying these laptops

7
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:44,450
from a master distributor.

8
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:51,750
Now remember, back here the manufacturer of the laptop had their cost of goods

9
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:58,460
sometimes abbreviated COGS, which include manufacturing costs, components, etc.

10
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:07,240
And finally, they had their sales costs, their R&D costs, and their general and administrative costs.

11
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:11,060
And finally, after all that, they make a profit.

12
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:15,480
So where do you fit? This is just a laptop manufacturer.

13
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:24,260
Assume this is Apple or HP. But in this case, you were a graphics chips supplier to Apple or HP.

14
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:29,170
And you were just one single component on their motherboard.

15
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:35,390
Well, if you really think about it, you were fitting in here in their costs of goods.

16
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:42,880
And now your cost of goods; your sales, general, and administrative costs;

17
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,980
your profit; and now your reseller costs.

18
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:51,900
Now, in some cases, you might've been selling directly your parts in to HP or Apple

19
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:55,950
and you would not have reseller costs but you would have more direct sales costs.

20
00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:02,560
Remember, this stands for sales, general, and administrative costs and so your profit is miniscule

21
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:08,100
compared to what the laptop manufacturer is making but you might be selling millions

22
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:16,750
of single chips and so that profit is multiplied by that high volume when you OEM a product.
