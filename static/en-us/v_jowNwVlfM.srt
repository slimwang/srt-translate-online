00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:02,810
All right, welcome back to Computer Vision.

2
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:04,310
So having done lines, and

3
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:07,939
remember lines are sort of the easiest version of a parametric model,

4
00:00:07,939 --> 00:00:11,820
now let's move to something just a little bit more complicated, namely circles.

5
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,290
So, here's the equation of a circle.

6
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:16,660
You remember this from, this is Mrs. McGillicutty's algebra class.

7
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:20,730
X minus a squared plus y minus b squared equals r squared, where a and

8
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:22,750
b are the center, and r is the radius.

9
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:27,280
And for now we're going to assume the radius is known.

10
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:28,280
How did you know it?

11
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:29,720
You know, Megan sent you a postcard and

12
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:33,110
said, the radius is 11, okay, fine, so you know the radius.

13
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:36,340
Oh, and we're also not, not going to use any gradient information just yet.

14
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:38,330
We're just going to find the location of the points.

15
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:42,070
So here we have a circle, we don't actually know where the circle is, but

16
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:47,030
we've detected say, three points on that circle, the blue dots here, okay?

17
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:48,450
So what is the Hough space?

18
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:51,400
What is the accumulator erase space for the circle?

19
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:54,510
Well since there are typically three unknowns, a, b, and r, but

20
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:58,750
I told you the radius, Hough space is just a and b.

21
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:03,030
Right, the center locations and the x and y direction.

22
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:06,181
So, now let's consider the first point, say let's say, x0,

23
00:01:06,181 --> 00:01:07,978
y0, this point right here, okay.

24
00:01:07,978 --> 00:01:16,460
So, that point has to lie on the circle, and we know its radius.

25
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:21,420
So one way of thinking about that, is that the circle is gotta

26
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:26,870
be some radius r around that point, all right?

27
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:29,590
And so what that does is it votes for

28
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:34,830
a set of points, and that's what this green line represents, right?

29
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:42,300
This set of points that are r around this location in the ab space, okay?

30
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:44,900
So for a single point in the image space,

31
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:49,240
we get a circle of radius r in the Hough space, all right?

32
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,820
Let's move to the next point.

33
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,740
Well, same thing, right?

34
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:56,560
So it's gotta be, again, a radius r around here.

35
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,050
And in Hough space, we're going to vote along this circle.

36
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:03,290
And again the next point.

37
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:07,380
And so if each point votes each point in the image votes for

38
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:09,350
a circle, we collect all the votes.

39
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:12,640
And so just as before, we get the majority of our votes here and

40
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,340
that corresponds to this middle point, and that's what's drawn there.

41
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:19,840
So it acts just like before where we were voting for lines, except now

42
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,300
instead of using the sinusoids, we're voting in a circle in an ab Hough space.
