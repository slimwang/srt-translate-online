Here's a Bayes network question.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Consider the following Bayes network with variables A all the way to I.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
A and B connects in to E. C and D connects into F.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
E connects into G and H, and F also connects into H but also into I.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I'm asking the question whether A is independent of B,

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
A is conditionally independent of B given E.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
A is conditionally independent of B given G.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
A is conditionally independent of B given F,

9
00:00:27,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and A is conditionally independent of C given G.
