1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,260
So we've covered all different
types of monetization models

2
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:05,040
from freemium to premium.

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,500
Which do you think is the best?

4
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:09,950
>> Well, premium was the easiest to do,
but most games have a free

5
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:13,940
option because it encourages more people
to try out the game in the first place.

6
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:16,560
We also learned about how
freemium games make money.

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,680
>> Yeah, I like learning about
the different types of ads.

8
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:24,360
And also learning how to code them into
a game using the Amazon mobile apps API.

9
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:26,570
What did you think was
the most interesting?

10
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:29,640
>> I thought learning about in app
purchases was great, because it went

11
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:33,410
into the details, like the importance
of being clear about value.

12
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:36,040
>> And we also mentioned
alternate ways to monetize.

13
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:39,520
Like through Amazon Underground and
outside your game by making and

14
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,160
selling merchandise.

15
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,300
>> Now that we've learned
about all these strategies,

16
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:44,261
what are our next steps?

17
00:00:44,261 --> 00:00:48,340
I'd say,
we're almost ready to publish your game.

18
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:50,880
>> In our next lesson,
will show you the best practices for

19
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,760
testing out your game and publishing it.
