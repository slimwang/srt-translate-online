1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,130
Type presents us with
an interesting problem.

2
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:06,140
Not only do we need to consider
different screen densities, but

3
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:09,380
we also need to factor in
the user's preferred text size.

4
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:10,840
More on that in a second.

5
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:12,770
Let's take a quick pop quiz.

6
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:15,690
Given that we need to support
different screen densities, and

7
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:20,070
preferred text size, what are the right
units for text in Android apps?
