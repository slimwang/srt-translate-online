1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,815
So now we've divided our search engine code into two modules, the crawler that

2
00:00:03,815 --> 00:00:07,474
builds the corpus this is everything we can do before the query. The search

3
00:00:07,474 --> 00:00:12,186
engine, that responds to query, this is everything that we do after a query

4
00:00:12,186 --> 00:00:16,401
starting with a known corpus. We're going to add a third module which we'll call

5
00:00:16,401 --> 00:00:21,481
test.py. That uses these two, that does some test building a corpus using our

6
00:00:21,481 --> 00:00:26,677
lucky search and ordered search to do some queries. So now the question is how

7
00:00:26,677 --> 00:00:31,458
do we need to set up imports to make this work? So here are the choices: search

8
00:00:31,458 --> 00:00:36,203
needs to import crawler, crawler needs to import search, test needs to import

9
00:00:36,203 --> 00:00:40,920
crawler, test needs to import search, search needs to import test. Check all of

10
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,099
the ones that are true.
