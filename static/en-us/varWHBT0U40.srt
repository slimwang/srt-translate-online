1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So this is the end of Unit 6.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Let me summarize what we've seen, and there are lots of connections

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
between the different things we've seen

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
that all use cryptography to solve problems.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
So the first thing we looked at was Anonymous Communication,

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
and we saw how to do that using onion routing

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
which was a chain of public key encryptions.

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
We looked at how to do voting using mixes.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
which also involved a chain of public key encryptions

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
with the addition of audited permutations.

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
We looked at how to provide

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
anonymous digital cash in a centralized way.

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
This involved using blind signatures.

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
But blind signatures pose the risk that if you don't know what you're signing

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
that's a big problem.

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
So we talked about the cut-and-choose technique

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
to verify the messages before signing the one that wasn't opened.

18
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
And finally we looked at bitcoin.

19
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
That provides a way to do decentralized digital cash.

20
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
This also used a chain of public keys

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
but unlike onion routing and voting, where we were using chains of encryptions,

22
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
in this case we are using chains of signatures.

23
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
And we also saw how bitcoin uses hash preimages as a proof of work.

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
And having proofs of work is useful for many other protocols,

25
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
So all these protocols use a combination of asymmetric cryptography

26
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
and symmetric cryptography typically involving hashing.

27
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
And there's a tremendous amount of things

28
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
that you can build with just these primatives.

29
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
In Unit 7, we'll look at a few more interesting applications of cryptography

30
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
and wrap up the course.

31
00:01:23,000 --> 99:59:59,999
I hope to see you there.
