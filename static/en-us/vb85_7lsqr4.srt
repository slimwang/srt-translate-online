00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,874
Right after I call session.commit( ),
I'll go ahead and add a flash message to

2
00:00:03,874 --> 00:00:07,000
let my user know that a item
has successfully been edited.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,100
Likewise, in my deleteMenuItem function
I'll add another flash message to let

4
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:13,160
the user know that
a item has been deleted.

5
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:15,470
Solutions for this challenge
are available in the instructor notes.
