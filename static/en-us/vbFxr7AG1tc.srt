00:00:00,342 --> 00:00:03,400
In Altryx, there's a few different
ways we're able to determine

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:06,110
how many null values we
have within our data set.

3
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:08,130
The way that I chose
to go about this and

4
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:11,590
I think them easiest way to do
is using a summarized tool.

5
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:13,978
So, let me bring one summarize
tools into the canvass.

6
00:00:13,978 --> 00:00:17,830
Let me drag that in between my
input data tool and my browse tool.

7
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:21,150
I am then going to highlight
all of my different fields,

8
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:24,610
meaning I want to make actions
on all of these fields.

9
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:29,420
The action I'm going to make is within
this add section which is going to be

10
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:31,510
counting the null values.

11
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:35,230
This is then going to output all
of those different variables and

12
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:37,370
renaming the fields a little bit.

13
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:39,200
Let me kick off this workflow now.

14
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,760
What I'm able to see is that most
of my fields have no null values,

15
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:44,080
as you see zero here.

16
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:47,940
Yet this number of voicemail
messages has a very high value

17
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:49,600
of missing records.

18
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,570
As well, we have some within
the total date calls.

19
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:56,490
And we have 95 over here at
the total night cost as well.

20
00:00:56,490 --> 00:01:00,280
This is in my opinion the easiest
way to just get a simple count

21
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,430
of the number of null
records within our data set.

22
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:05,330
There are some other approaches
like I mentioned before,

23
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:10,030
a great way to analyze nulls within
our data set as a holistic approach

24
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:13,290
is looking through a field summary tool
which will give us the percentage of

25
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:15,470
missing records within this data set.

26
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:18,290
This is an approach we might
take later to determine

27
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:21,770
how we want to actually deal with
this number of missing records.
