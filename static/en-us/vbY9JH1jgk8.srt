1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,010
So there are all these different ways
you can think about what recognition is.

2
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:06,970
And one of the two main distinctions
we've already talked about, but

3
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:08,500
it pays to point it out again,

4
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:11,890
is this difference between
single instance labeling, okay?

5
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:12,900
So here's a picture of a car.

6
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:15,940
And we say, you know, that's John's car.

7
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:20,100
Okay, and so we want to be able to find
that particular thing versus we'd like

8
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:24,090
to be able to find all of these
things and say, okay, those are cars.

9
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:27,160
For the most part, we're going to
be worrying about this problem,

10
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:30,210
the generic categorization problem,
okay?

11
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:33,450
So object categorization
described in a variety of ways.

12
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:37,560
This is a slide from Kristin and Barrett
Leibe, and that I changed a little bit.

13
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,010
Generically it's kind of like this.

14
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:44,598
Given some number of training examples,
training images of a category, recognize

15
00:00:44,598 --> 00:00:50,260
some a-priori unknown instances of that
category and assign the correct label.

16
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:53,400
Now you notice that I put down
small in parentheses, you know,

17
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,480
right here it says small.

18
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:59,400
These days not a lot of work
is done on the small number?

19
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,660
That is that, typically we
have lots of large examples.

20
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:04,610
And there's a question about
how method's that go from

21
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:07,260
taking large data could
then use small data?

22
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:09,440
To me that's a slightly more
interesting problem, but

23
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:12,350
we'll leave the small as being
sort of optional at this point.

24
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:15,490
But the basic idea is that I give
you a set of these things and

25
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:19,490
some sort of labels, and you want to
give me back the correct label.

26
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:23,190
All right.
So one of the things we have to do,

27
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:28,980
before we can even proceed is,
we have to agree on a set of labels.

28
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:32,920
And there's this fundamental
problem that a single object

29
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,710
doesn't have a unique label.

30
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:37,670
So here we have somebody's dog,
apparently named Fido,

31
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:40,200
I don't know if anybody names
their dogs Fido anymore.

32
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,940
So you can say well this is Fido or
you could say this is a German shepherd.

33
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:45,410
You could say this is a dog.

34
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:50,310
You could say, doesn't say, say it's
a mammal, you could say it's an animal.

35
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:53,440
You could say it's a living thing
although a living being is probably I

36
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,410
don't know out there.

37
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:59,240
But it, it is these things, right, so
there's this question is what categories

38
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:03,370
are best for visual identification or
which ones do we agree upon.
