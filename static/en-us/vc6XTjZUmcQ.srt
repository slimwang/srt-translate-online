1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:03,430
We're going to be going back and
forth between the Objective C and

2
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:05,390
the Swift versions of GIF maker.

3
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:08,680
So go ahead and
open up both projects in Xcode.

4
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:10,960
Here we are in the Objective C project.

5
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,960
And we want to see how
the video camera is presented.

6
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:17,140
So let's say I didn't know
anything about this project.

7
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:20,320
But I do know that the UI
image picker controller

8
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,280
is what presents the video camera.

9
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:25,900
I could go over here on the left and
search image picker controller, and

10
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:29,120
I could find out where the code
to present the camera is.

11
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,040
And here you can see it's in this file
called UI view controller plus record.

12
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:35,860
It turns out,

13
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:39,750
we need to present the video camera
from two different UI view controllers.

14
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:43,380
So the code to present the image picker
controller is in this UI view controller

15
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:44,779
record category.

16
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:47,980
Okay.
So present video options.

17
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:49,610
That seems promising.

18
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:51,000
Let's check out this method.

19
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:54,370
Action sheet record video.

20
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:56,680
That looks like what we're looking for.

21
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:01,720
Now this record video
action calls launch camera.

22
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:05,010
Let's take a look at
the launch camera method.

23
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:08,390
Okay, here's where the image picker
controller is being created.
