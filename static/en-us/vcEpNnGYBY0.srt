>> It actually wouldn't be an equation at all. If we substitute 0 into the spots

00:00:05,088 --> 00:00:09,786
for A and B, in the equation we would get 0x and 0y equals C and if the left

00:00:09,786 --> 00:00:14,646
hand side is just equal to 0 and that would require C to be 0 as well, but the

00:00:14,646 --> 00:00:20,094
questions specifies that c is specifically not 0. This can not work. This is not

an equation.
