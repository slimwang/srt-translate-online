00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:03,860
So to get some insight into this question, I want to show you some very

2
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:08,380
very greatly reduced images which are still going to be meaningful, that is,

3
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:11,470
you know, what is going on to me in use, so normally when I do this in class,

4
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:14,470
what I do is I say raise your hand when you can tell me, if you can tell me,

5
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:15,510
what’s in the picture.

6
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:17,000
So I would show then this.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,270
And everybody would raise their hand, and

8
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:19,610
they would say it’s some goofy looking lion.

9
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:20,490
All right?

10
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:23,910
And I would show them a picture like this, okay, there, there’s an elephant.

11
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:25,880
There’s a really cool, old car.

12
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:29,440
There is a, something I'm never going to own, a private jet.

13
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:34,830
But what you can see about these pictures is there's actually not a lot of

14
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:39,140
pixels being used in this, in these pictures of different grayscale values.

15
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:42,830
Instead, somebody has just sort of drawn in the edges.

16
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:46,550
And yet, that conveys to you a lot of the information.

17
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:50,900
So the idea is that, in some sense, edges in an image seem to be important,

18
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:53,170
they seem to convey something about what's going on.
