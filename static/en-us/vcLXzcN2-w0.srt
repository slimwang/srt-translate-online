00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,120
Now that we've defined the basic
geometric objects of study for

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,010
this course, vectors, we can talk
about how to manipulate them.

3
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:08,100
In the upcoming lesson,

4
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:10,970
you will begin programming your
personal library of functions for

5
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:14,930
operating on vectors, which you will use
throughout the remainder of the course.
