00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,412
We ended the last quiz with this equation, but if we add k to both sides, we

2
00:00:05,412 --> 00:00:10,992
could end up with this equation, u equals x squared minus 2hx plus h squared

3
00:00:10,992 --> 00:00:16,370
plus k. So here, y is by itself on one side, and then all of the x terms and

4
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:21,477
constants are on the right side. We've seen a number of equations for parabolas

5
00:00:21,477 --> 00:00:25,637
that are in this form, even if we didn't see general forms of them written with

6
00:00:25,637 --> 00:00:30,211
constants like these. So let's compare this to another parabola. Maybe y equals

7
00:00:30,211 --> 00:00:34,891
x squared, plus 6x plus 5, now because these two equations are in the same form,

8
00:00:34,891 --> 00:00:39,355
we should be able to figure out the value of each of the constants over here,

9
00:00:39,355 --> 00:00:44,304
based on the value of constants over here. So compared to this general equation,

10
00:00:44,304 --> 00:00:48,692
in equation y equals x squared plus 6 x plus 5, what number is h equal to? So

11
00:00:48,692 --> 00:00:53,172
find where the constant h appears in this general equation, figure out where

12
00:00:53,172 --> 00:00:57,792
that corresponds to in our equation with particular values inserted, and then

13
00:00:57,792 --> 00:01:02,312
calculate age based on that. This is a little bit tricky, but just give it a few

14
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:02,755
tries.
