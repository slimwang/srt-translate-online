1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,673
Okay, so based on these answers, I know that 1 half is equal to 2 4ths. I also

2
00:00:04,685 --> 00:00:09,074
know that one half is equal to 3 6th. So how exactly did I do that? How did I

3
00:00:09,086 --> 00:00:13,926
change this into this? Well, if I look at this shape and this one, I notice that

4
00:00:13,938 --> 00:00:18,567
I just doubled the number of pieces that are in this shape. And I doubled the

5
00:00:18,579 --> 00:00:23,274
number of pieces that I have shaded. So I doubled both. The numerator and the

6
00:00:23,286 --> 00:00:28,738
denominator, and I got 1 times 2 which is 2 and 2 times 2 which is 4 or 2 4ths.

7
00:00:28,838 --> 00:00:33,560
Now let's look between the one half and the 3 6ths. This time I took my shaded

8
00:00:33,572 --> 00:00:39,264
pieces and I tripled them, so I multiplied them by 3. I also took the total

9
00:00:39,276 --> 00:00:44,003
number of pieces, I had 2. And now I have a total number of pieces of 6. So I

10
00:00:44,015 --> 00:00:48,884
also tripled my number of pieces. 1 times 3 is 3. And 2 times 3 is 6. But let's

11
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:53,669
think about why we can do this. I know 2 divided by 2 is really just 1. So I'm

12
00:00:53,681 --> 00:00:57,652
just multiplying one half by a form of 1. I'm not changing the value one half.

13
00:00:57,986 --> 00:01:03,220
I'm just changing what the fraction looks like. The same is true down here. I'm

14
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:07,796
taking one half and multiplying it by a different form of 1. And I'll get 3

15
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:11,918
6ths. So we know one half is equal to 2 4ths which is equal to 3 6ths. These are

16
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:16,854
all equivalent fractions. Okay, but let's look a little bit closer at this 2

17
00:01:16,866 --> 00:01:18,012
over 2 and 3 over 3.
