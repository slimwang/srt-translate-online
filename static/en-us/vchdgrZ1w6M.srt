Welcome to homework assignment #4 in CS373.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
To remind you, we covered A-star and dynamic programming in class.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Let's start with an A-star question.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
We learned in class that we can use heuristics,

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
and a heuristic is a admissible if the heuristic value is no larger

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
than the actual cost it takes to get to the goal.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
In a maze, we know that the number of steps in the maze is a good heuristic,

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
because obstacles will make the path only longer, not shorter.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Consider a maze of size 3 x 3 and say there's a single goal state,

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
and the cost of moving is 1.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Is the function shown here admissible or not?

12
00:00:43,000 --> 99:59:59,999
