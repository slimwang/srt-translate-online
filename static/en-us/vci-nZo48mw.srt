1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
To see if it's a tree, the first thing we need to do is to see if the graph is connected.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Looking through the 8 graphs, you can see that the fourth graph is not connected.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Recoloring the edges, we can see that these three nodes are not connected to these three nodes.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
So, this one can't be a tree. All the other graphs are connected.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
The next thing we need to look for are cycles.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
The second graph is a ring, and it's obviously a cycle.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
In the seventh graph, there's a cycle between these four nodes connected by the edges in pink.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
So, that can't be a tree. That leaves these other fives graphs, all of which are trees.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Now, some of these--like this one--it's kind of obvious that it looks like a tree.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
But the eighth graph doesn't really look like a tree. Why do we call it a tree graph?

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
What we can do is number and rearrange the nodes to make it look like a tree.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
There are seven nodes in this graph, and I've numbered them 0 through 6.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Let's start rearranging this. Let's start with node 6.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Now, node 6 is connected to node 2, so we'll draw that connection.

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Node 6 is also connected to node 1, so there's that edge.

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
We can see that node 2 is connected to node 4 and node 5,

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
and so we can draw in those nodes and the edges.

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Then node 1 is connected to node 0 and node 3.

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Here are those nodes and edges drawn in.

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
We can see that we can transform this graph, which doesn't look like a tree at all,

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
into something that looks a little bit more like a tree. It branches out.

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Hopefully, that gives you some idea of why we call these tree graphs.
