1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:01,800
In our next question, actually,

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:05,810
we are talking about the kind of labels
that we have seen, that we discussed.

3
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:07,290
So, two labels.

4
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:09,340
Remember, I keep talking about labels.

5
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:15,090
The uppercase L labels are the secret or
top-secret sensitivity level,

6
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:20,800
so L1 is secret comma, this is pretends
to since this comes from the DOD,

7
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,090
has a different command, so
let's hit towers Asia and Europe.

8
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:27,050
L2 is something about Europe and
South America.

9
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:29,760
So one is secret,
the other is top secret.

10
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,790
So there are three options and
I want you to look into each and

11
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:37,450
if it is true, then you check that box.
