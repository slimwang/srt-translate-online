00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:03,450
So I don't know if you agree with Aaron
or not, that he's funnier than I am.

2
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:05,020
He thinks he is, I think he is too.

3
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:05,780
We'll give him that.

4
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:09,680
In that lecture he talked about
extrinsic camera calibration.

5
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:12,510
That is figuring out from
information from a variety of

6
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:15,010
images where the camera
is in the 3D world

7
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:18,550
that could actually help us extract
information about 3D environments.

8
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:21,780
Next, the lecture is going to be
about intrinsic camera calibration.
