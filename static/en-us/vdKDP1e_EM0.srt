1
00:00:00,188 --> 00:00:05,794
The first question was to make sure that
the candidate understands optionals and

2
00:00:05,794 --> 00:00:06,954
how to use them.

3
00:00:06,954 --> 00:00:10,396
And most importantly,
how not to use them in SWF.

4
00:00:10,396 --> 00:00:14,487
Considering the recent
improvements in Xcode,

5
00:00:14,487 --> 00:00:19,985
that it will detect common mistakes and
offer a solution for you.

6
00:00:19,985 --> 00:00:23,881
It's very easy to just
type exclamation points or

7
00:00:23,881 --> 00:00:28,810
whatever the IDE subjects,
just to make the compiler shut up.

8
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:31,434
With SWF, that's a receipt for
the for disaster.

9
00:00:31,434 --> 00:00:35,377
You need to understand how
unwrapping an optional works, so

10
00:00:35,377 --> 00:00:38,393
that was the reason for
that first question and

11
00:00:38,393 --> 00:00:41,730
the candidates seem to
understand it pretty well.
