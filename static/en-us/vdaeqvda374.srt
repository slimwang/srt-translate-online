1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:00,860
>> Alright, what do you got?

2
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:01,470
>> Who me?

3
00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:04,700
>> Yeah. So, for each one, tell me whether or not it's infinite.

4
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:08,080
>> Okay. Linear separators they seeming like half

5
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,440
planes, or lines, or, you know, depending upon dimensionality.

6
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:12,880
There are, of course, an infinite number of

7
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,480
these things. There are an infinite number of lines.

8
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,660
>> So, that, we'll check that one off.

9
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:19,930
>> So, y equals mx plus b. And, I can put any real number for m. Any real

10
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:23,240
number for b. Infinite number of those, in fact

11
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,480
theres not just an infinite number of those there is

12
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:28,910
alif one of those infinite numbers. We should

13
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:31,500
talk about that one day. Artificial neutral networks

14
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,170
are exactly the same thing, they have weights

15
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:35,040
those weights are real numbers, so even if there

16
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,470
were only one weight there is an infinite

17
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:38,710
number Of real numbers to chose from, so

18
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:42,190
that's also the limit. Decision trees, with discrete

19
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:45,090
inputs. I have two answers for you here Michael.

20
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:45,840
>> O, Oh!

21
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,440
>> Answer one is, of course, it's finite,

22
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:50,800
a, a, assuming there is only a finite number

23
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,590
of features. The other answer is it could be infinite if I'm allowed

24
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:58,880
to re-use features over and over again even if they're useless to reuse.

25
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,470
But that is sort of insane ans silly, and no one will ever

26
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:04,560
do that, so I think the, that right answer is to leave it unchecked.

27
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,390
>> Okay.

28
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:07,810
>> And then finally decision tree with continuous inputs. Well,

29
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:10,220
that's the same. We had a long conversation about this when

30
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:13,250
we talked about decision trees. We can keep asking questions

31
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:15,970
about them so if there's a sort of an infinite number

32
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:18,370
of questions you can ask. I can say, well, is this

33
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:21,300
feature greater than .1. And then ask is it greater than

34
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:23,040
.11. Then is it greater than .111, then .1111, then 1111111

35
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,610
and so on and so forth. So, that is also infinite.

36
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:30,170
>> So basically everything we've talked

37
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:31,430
about, or nearly everything we've talked

38
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:34,650
about actually doesn't fit the analysis that we talked about last time.

39
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:35,590
>> What about k and n?

40
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:38,180
>> Yeah so k and n is a little bit of a mess.

41
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:41,100
I think you and I maybe don't completely agree on this one. So

42
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:45,170
I think of k and n, the classifier that comes out of a k

43
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:49,330
and n is defined by the set of data points that are the, the neighbors.

44
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:50,381
>> Mm-hm.

45
00:01:50,381 --> 00:01:52,970
>> And. There's an infinite number of ways of

46
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:54,640
laying out those points. So theres an infinite number

47
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,960
of different tan N base classifiers that you could

48
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,490
have. But you have a counter argument to that.

49
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:02,940
>> Right, which is that if you assume the training set

50
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:06,440
is fixed. And that's just part of the parameters of the hypothese

51
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,440
base then. It is an infinite. There's, in

52
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,580
fact, only one. It all just depends upon

53
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:11,830
Q. And it always gives you the same

54
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:13,740
answer, no matter what. So I think the hypothesis

55
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:15,550
space, you could argue, is finite. It all

56
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:17,450
depends upon what it is you're taking as

57
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:19,030
part of the hypothesis. And what it is

58
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:20,370
you aren't taking as part of the hypothesis space.

59
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:22,800
>> Right. Sort of, whether the data is built in

60
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,010
or not. But it, but it, you know? Is strikes

61
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:28,390
me that these other methods are also similar in that,

62
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:31,240
if you bake in the data, there's just the one answer.

63
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,680
But yeah it's a, k and n

64
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:36,015
is weird. Right? Because it's sometimes called non-parametric.

65
00:02:36,015 --> 00:02:36,340
>> Right.

66
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:38,860
>> Which sounds like it should mean that it has no parameters

67
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:41,610
but what it actually means that it has an infinite number of parameters.

68
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:43,820
>> Right. By the way, I don't think that's true about baking

69
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:48,320
things in. So, for example, if I give you a set of data.

70
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,785
There's still an infinite number of

71
00:02:49,785 --> 00:02:52,420
neuro-networks that are consistent with that data.

72
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:56,350
There's a whole bunch of decision trees that are consistent with that data.

73
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:58,780
So you don't always get the same answer every time. Certainly

74
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:01,070
with neuro-networks you don't because you're starting at a random place.

75
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:02,850
>> But it, but if you, right. If you're

76
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:04,920
bake in the algorithm and the data and I think

77
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,570
in k and n that is exactly what you're doing.

78
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:09,540
But I agree that we can agree to not agree.

79
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:10,470
>> Agreed.
