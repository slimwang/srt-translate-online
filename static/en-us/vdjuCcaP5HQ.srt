Hi there.

2
00:00:01,819 --> 00:00:04,980
Welcome to our course on
deploying a Hadoop cluster.

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:07,300
I'm Matt Leonard,
I'll be your instructor.

4
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:10,670
These days companies collect massive
amounts of data, hundreds and

5
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:12,660
thousands of terabytes.

6
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:16,440
Analyzing terabytes of data on one
computer is practically impossible.

7
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,190
One simple analysis
job could take hours.

8
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:22,520
A different approach is to spread
the data over a cluster of computers and

9
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:25,680
analyze it in parallel with Hadoop and
Map Reduce.

10
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,620
In this first lesson,
you'll deploy a simple hadoop cluster.

11
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:33,020
You wouldn't actually use this cluster
in a real production setting, but

12
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:35,140
it will help you understand
the Hadoop architecture.

13
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:40,670
In later lessons, you'll use automated
methods to deploy larger clusters,

14
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:41,730
like you'd use in production.

15
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:46,730
To complete this course, you'll need
a basic understanding of Hadoop and

16
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:50,050
HDFS, and
be able to write MapReduce programs.

17
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,132
If you don't know about these,

18
00:00:51,132 --> 00:00:54,080
take our excellent Intro to
Hadoop course, then return here.

19
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:58,430
Also you'll need to use Shell
commands such as SSH and

20
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:00,490
no terminal editor such as vim or nano.

21
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:03,800
You can learn about these
in our command line course.

22
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:04,670
Okay, let's get started.
