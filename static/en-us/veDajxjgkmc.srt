One answer is private String name. You might have used a different name for the

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:08,820
variable here. This declaration says that the variable is private, because it's

3
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:13,514
an instance variable. Its type is String, because it's literal text. And I gave

4
00:00:13,514 --> 00:00:18,460
it the name, name, but maybe you came up with something different. As long as

5
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:23,662
it means something like name, that's good.
