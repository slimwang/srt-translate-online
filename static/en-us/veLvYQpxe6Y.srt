1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:04,360
So the really cool thing about doing this is that now we

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:07,060
can take perspective projection and

3
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:12,780
make it a linear matrix operation while we're working in homogenous coordinates.

4
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:18,410
And we don't have to worry about the nonhomogeneous part until the very end.

5
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:20,220
So that looks like this.

6
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:24,729
So here I have a three by four matrix, and you notice it's 1, 1, 1 over f.

7
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:31,210
And I multiply that by my homogenous 3D coordinate, xyz1, and

8
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:35,260
I get out this three dimensional homogeneous coordinate, right.

9
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:41,190
So it's 2D homogeneous coordinate 3, with component x, y, and z over f.

10
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:42,270
Okay?

11
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:45,940
And I can just keep this around as a homogeneous coordinate until I

12
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:48,210
actually need to use it in an image.

13
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:52,050
And when I use it as an image, I do the division of the top element by

14
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:58,330
the homogeneous element, and I would get f times x over z and f times y over z.

15
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:01,030
Which by the way is sometimes called u, v.

16
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:06,440
And those are the coordinates in the image of some point x,

17
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:12,130
y, z out in the world projected through a projection with a focal length of f.

18
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:17,090
And so our projection operator was this linear matrix multiplication, and

19
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:19,710
as we know, we all love linear matrix multiplications,

20
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:21,270
because we know how to do them a lot.

21
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:23,180
And invert them and all other kinds of stuff.

22
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:26,807
And it's really the basis behind projective geometry, and the projection

23
00:01:26,807 --> 00:01:29,919
mathematics that we'll be using for a bunch of the course actually.

24
00:01:29,919 --> 00:01:35,580
By the way, f, from now on, is for focal length.

25
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:37,240
Before we're talking about that distance D, so

26
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:40,880
here our focal length is the distance from the center of projection to the image

27
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,966
plane, and it is not the f of the aperture that we were talking about last time.

28
00:01:44,966 --> 00:01:46,270
I probably shouldn't have even reminded you,

29
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:48,800
because it's probably months ago since you watched that lecture.

30
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,180
But f here is always going to be focal length,

31
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:54,610
which is the distance from the center projection to the image plane.

32
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:59,770
So how does scaling the projection matrix change the transformation?

33
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:03,910
Well, here what I've done is I've scaled my projection matrix by f.

34
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:07,970
I could have scaled it by something else, but I'll, I'll scale it by f.

35
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:11,350
So now, instead of having along that diagonal of 1, 1, and

36
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:16,650
1 over f, instead, I just multiply by f and I have f, f, and 1.

37
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:20,590
Multiply that by my three dimensional homogenous coordinated vector which has

38
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:21,790
four dimensions to it.

39
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:24,630
Now I get out fx, fy, and z.

40
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:28,840
And then when I do that division, what do I get, the same thing I got before.

41
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,070
Okay? So it was invariant.
