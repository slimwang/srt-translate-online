00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:02,969
Let's jump right into lesson one with an example.

2
00:00:02,969 --> 00:00:05,090
Let's say you have a big exam tomorrow and

3
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:07,850
your memory needs to be as sharp as possible.

4
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:11,200
What would you do to prepare? Well, let's say I

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,095
asked this question to a bunch of people and

6
00:00:14,095 --> 00:00:16,540
42% said they would get a good workout the

7
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:19,830
night before, 28% said they would eat a good

8
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:25,370
dinner. 16% said they would stay up studying. 13% said

9
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:29,410
they'd get a good night's sleep. And the remaining 1% said something

10
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:34,830
else. Would you believe these survey results? Before deciding whether or not you

11
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:39,520
would, what would you want to know? How many people I surveyed, who

12
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:44,530
I surveyed, or maybe, how the survey was conducted. Check all that apply.
