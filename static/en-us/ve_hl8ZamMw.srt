1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,370
Here's the efficient solution.

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:04,150
The trick is that we're
going to use recursion.

3
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:06,980
And I'm not going to show you
something called the trellis diagram,

4
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:10,320
which is a, a way of thinking
about a graph model of this.

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,270
But what we're going to take advantage
of, remember the Markovian property?

6
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:18,440
The Markovian property says that
the probability of going to some state

7
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:21,010
only depends upon where I am now.

8
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:24,440
It does not depend upon how I got here.

9
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:25,120
Right?
So

10
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:28,800
if today is sunny,
the probability of tomorrow being sunny

11
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,870
is not affected by whether yesterday
was rainy, snowy, or sunny.

12
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:33,910
That's my assumption.

13
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:36,960
That's my first-order
Markovian assumption.

14
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,120
So to take advantage of that, we're
going to define some auxiliary variables

15
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:42,390
and define a recursive algorithm.

16
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:45,440
So the first thing we're going to
define is what's called the forward

17
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,170
variable alpha.

18
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:54,280
Okay, an alpha sub t
of i is defined to be

19
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:58,770
the probability of seeing all
the observations up until time t,

20
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,580
and at time t being in state i.

21
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:04,080
Okay?

22
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,750
That's exactly what
it says in this book.

23
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:08,260
In well,
now there's a box inside the box there.

24
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:12,600
So it's the probability of seeing
everything from 1 until t and

25
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,930
being at in type t being in state i.

26
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:20,440
The really cool thing about that is,
I can define a recursive definition for

27
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,670
this very easily.

28
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:27,790
All right, so
you start off a1 of i is what?

29
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:33,190
Well it's the probability of having
seen the observation at time 1 and

30
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:36,442
the probability of being
in state i at time 1.

31
00:01:36,442 --> 00:01:38,060
Okay, well that's easy.

32
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:46,300
Pi sub i is the probability of
starting in state i, and b i of o1,

33
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:50,940
is the probability of seeing that
first symbol if you were in state i.

34
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:51,807
So that's how you initialize it.

35
00:01:51,807 --> 00:01:55,277
Now comes the really re, cool thing,
and before we write it out,

36
00:01:55,277 --> 00:01:56,612
think about it this way.

37
00:01:56,612 --> 00:02:03,025
At some time t, the probability of
landing in state j is going to be,

38
00:02:03,025 --> 00:02:08,874
well, either I was in state 1 before and
I ended up at state J or

39
00:02:08,874 --> 00:02:14,294
I was in 2 before or
I was in 3 before or I was in 4 before.

40
00:02:14,294 --> 00:02:15,400
Right?

41
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,060
And these are what are referred
to as mutually exclusive, so

42
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:20,240
the probability is just the sum of them.

43
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,620
And that's how this is written here,
right?

44
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:26,130
What this says is that
alpha of t plus 1 of j.

45
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:31,520
So that's the probability at
time t plus 1 of being in state

46
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:36,760
j and having seen all the 1
to t plus 1 observations.

47
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:39,800
Is just, well, just as I said before,

48
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:43,680
it's the sum over all the different
possible states, right?

49
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:50,020
There's n possible states of possibly
being in those states at time t.

50
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:53,000
That's what alpha t is, right?

51
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,440
And alpha t also includes all of
the observations, up through t,

52
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:01,470
times the transition probability
of going from i to j.

53
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:05,340
Remember, we're trying to
compute alpha t plus 1 of j.

54
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:06,400
Going from i to j.

55
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,220
So that's the probability
that I land in this state, j.

56
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:14,570
And now, I also have to talk about
the output symbol, at time t plus 1.

57
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:17,316
Well, that's b sub j of ot plus 1.

58
00:03:17,316 --> 00:03:17,998
All right?
And

59
00:03:17,998 --> 00:03:21,340
there's no way of thinking
that I can reach that j

60
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:23,730
state from any of the preceding states.

61
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:26,110
So I just define that recursively.

62
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:28,380
That means I can do one
more really cool thing.

63
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:29,500
Okay?

64
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,140
So I could obviously run
this all the way to t.

65
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:35,950
So I could tell you the probability
of seeing all of the observations,

66
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:39,165
1 through cap t, and landing in state 1.

67
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:44,550
And all the observations and
landing in state 2, and landing is,

68
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:48,110
suppose all I want is the probability
of the observations, right.

69
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:50,530
I don't actually care
what state I end up in.

70
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:56,510
Well that means that the probability of
the observation given the machine and

71
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:58,490
that's what we're trying to compute,

72
00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:03,520
is just the sum of all
the alpha cap T of I's, right?

73
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:07,856
Alpha cap t is the probability of seeing
all of the sequence, of i meaning and

74
00:04:07,856 --> 00:04:08,710
landing in state i.

75
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:11,240
I sum that up over all the i's, and

76
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:15,400
that's the probability of
the entire observation sequence.

77
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,670
So you recursively solve that problem.

78
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:22,260
So remember before it was n to the t,
which is a really,

79
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:28,130
really awful number, the complexity
of this is just n squared t.

80
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:30,160
Okay?
Through the, the recursion.

81
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,550
Each time step, you have n squared
things you have to look at,

82
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:34,900
you do it t times and
so it's n squared t.

83
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:39,300
And for any reasonable numbers,
n squared t is way, way, way,

84
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:42,090
way less than n to the t.

85
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:42,800
All right?

86
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,520
So, that's that efficient
solution of the forward,

87
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:49,470
using the forward algorithm and allows
us to recover, solve that first problem.
