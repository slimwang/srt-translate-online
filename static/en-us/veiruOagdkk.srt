1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:04,820
To find the commit which reverted the controls, first I'll type git log.

2
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:08,750
Now, I don't see a commit with the message revert controls yet, so

3
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:11,090
I'll press the down arrow and scroll down.

4
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:11,870
And here it is.

5
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:15,160
Since I found it, I'll press Q to quit out of git log.

6
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:19,100
So this is the commit ID of the commit that reverted the controls.

7
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:21,670
It starts with b067.

8
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:25,120
Now I want to see how many lines were introduced in this commit.

9
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:28,490
Remember that the changes introduced by this commit will be

10
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:30,980
different from the previous commit.

11
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:36,250
So, I can copy this commit ID, type git diff and

12
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:40,740
paste it, and then I'll copy and paste this commit ID.

13
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:42,870
Now I can just count up the lines that have changed.

14
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:45,600
So far, there's two insertions and two deletions.

15
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,230
We'll scroll down.

16
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:50,440
Another insertion and deletion, so that's three each.

17
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:53,550
Another, so four each.

18
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:55,860
And I'll press Q to quit git diff.

19
00:00:55,860 --> 00:01:00,610
So, the correct commit ID started with b067 and

20
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:04,140
there were four lines added and four lines deleted by that commit.
