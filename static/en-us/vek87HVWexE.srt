00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,680
Welcome to the last lesson. Here, we're going to return to

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:05,490
a data set that we've talked about several times before, the open

3
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:08,750
street map data set, and we're going to make a case study

4
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:11,550
out of it. There are several reasons why we chose to use

5
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:14,120
this data set for the case study. First is that it's

6
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:18,540
a really nice data set, freely available for download, and it's XML,

7
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:21,490
which is a data format we've gained some experience with During this

8
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:25,230
course, now this is a human edited data set. So for our

9
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:27,480
purposes this is great because there are a lot of

10
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:31,270
opportunities for cleaning. And it's relatable. You can download the

11
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:34,310
data for your own city block, your favorite summer travel

12
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:38,300
destination or a place you want to visit someday. And finally,

13
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:41,350
it's open source. Anyone can contribute to this data set.

14
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:44,610
And you can potentially submit back the improvements you made.

15
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:47,540
As you work through this case study. Just an option.

16
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:50,680
Now, the exercises we'll use the data set that I chose,

17
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:53,600
of a city that I know very well, Chicago. Now

18
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,320
we're going to grade the submissions according to this data set,

19
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,670
but please bear in mind that there might be cultural

20
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:03,660
differences in how, for example, phone numbers or addresses. Are formatted.

21
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:07,110
What makes sense in Chicago might not make sense in,

22
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:09,750
say, Kobe. So, if you want to take your improvements

23
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:12,230
back to the community that created the map, you should

24
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:16,210
take local specifics into account. Okay. Good luck, and have fun.
