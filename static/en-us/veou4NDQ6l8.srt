00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,800
This question tests that you understand loops.

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:05,670
Your goal is to define a procedure called countdown,

3
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:08,010
that takes a positive whole number as its input,

4
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:12,780
and it prints out a countdown from that number down to 1, followed by "Blastoff!"

5
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:14,980
Here is an example--

6
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:16,780
If we call countdown passing in 3--

7
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:20,780
your procedure should output 3--2--1--Blastoff!
