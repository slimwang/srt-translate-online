1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:05,780
So now let's ask the question, how can we use the filtering mechanisms that

2
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:09,420
we have looked at so far to find interesting features in an image?

3
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,830
So here, for an example, are the two images.

4
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:16,239
You may recall them from the instance of the panorama building experiment or

5
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:18,110
exercise we did earlier.

6
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:20,480
And we want to be able to take these two images.

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,090
You know, one this image here and that image.

8
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:26,800
And actually for this case, for just sake of, let's say building a panorama,

9
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:31,530
we want to be able to find features that are similar in between those things.

10
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:33,130
Then we can do things like alignment.

11
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:37,510
So in this case what I'm interested in is finding information that's

12
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:39,230
similar in both of them.

13
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:42,760
Here I've basically created about one, two, three, four,

14
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:47,810
five circles that kind of point to specific features or information in

15
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:52,080
this image, and again the same five features are available in this image.

16
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:56,520
Again, if you remember, this was a pan camera motion from this to that.

17
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,538
So there were two different images of course.

18
00:00:58,538 --> 00:01:00,380
And you can notice that there are different images,

19
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:03,090
except that they have a little bit of overlap.

20
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:06,740
And of course what we want to do is find the same feature in both of them.

21
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:10,760
Here I've just drawn the lines between them pointing out the correspondence that

22
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:16,030
this same point here is also visible here, that one is visible here, and so on.

23
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:21,070
So to achieve this process of being able to then align these two images, or

24
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:25,500
find different things that are similar in them so then we can actually register

25
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:29,240
them together, we need to extract some sort of higher level features.

26
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:31,540
So one of the biggest advantages of mapping or

27
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:35,040
extracting these features from an image is it allows us to

28
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,190
map these raw pixels into an intermediate representation.

29
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:42,920
Which basically means, is that now we can basically take an image,

30
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:47,200
extract those features, and not actually be looking at the image any more, but

31
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,980
just those features.

32
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:51,520
Such an intermediate representation allows us to have,

33
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:56,050
to have a lot of information but also kind of reduce the amount of data.

34
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:59,520
Because what I would just do is, after a while, process this image,

35
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:04,000
find all those 5 or maybe sometimes 20 different features.

36
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,625
And 20 different features in here,

37
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:08,270
and basically just attach that information and

38
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:12,530
not anymore require me to carry around the image or the information in there.

39
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:18,300
So this is of course a kind of a data preservation in of information,

40
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,900
which we can use for a variety of things.
