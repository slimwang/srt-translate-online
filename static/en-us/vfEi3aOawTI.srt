1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:01,260
So here is the question again.

2
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:04,840
We're trying to write a query that
returns all the species in the zoo,

3
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:06,850
along with their populations.

4
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:08,650
And here is one possible answer.

5
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:13,880
Select count of star as num,
species from animals.

6
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:15,490
Group by species.

7
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:19,050
Order by num descending,
or desc for short.

8
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:21,080
And here's what's going
on in that query.

9
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:26,000
Count star as num, and species
are the columns that we want to return.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,210
Animals is the table that
we're going to select from.

11
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:33,660
We're aggregating by species and
aggregation is the count.

12
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:37,720
And then we're ordering,
by that count column num descending.

13
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:39,160
By answering this quiz,

14
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:42,880
we've put together the count
aggregation, grouping and ordering.

15
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:46,790
The query for this exercise did not
require the where clause at all,

16
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:49,350
because we didn't want to exclude
any rows from the census.
