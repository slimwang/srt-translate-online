00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
[Evans] So here's the idea of how to do this.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
We're going to start by selecting some secret,

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
and then we're going to compute the hash of that secret,

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
and then we're going to do that again.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
We're going to compute the hash that we got for the first time as the input,

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
and we're going to keep computing hashes here.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
This could be done anywhere. I've written it on the server side.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
The important point at the end of this--

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
so what Alice gets is the hash of s, the hash of the hash of s,

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
the hash of the hash of the hash of s and so forth.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Of course, if she just has s, she could compute all of these herself.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
The server only stores 1 thing.

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
The only thing the server stores is the last value in this hash chain.

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
So let's suppose we did this 100 times.

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,000
This is the value the server would store, and that's the only value stored by the server.

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:57,000
So now the protocol to log in will be Alice will send the 99th value in this hash chain.

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
So what the server will do is compute the hash of p,

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
check if it's equal to the stored value x.

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
If it is, it will allow Alice to log in

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
and will also update the value of x.

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The new value of x will be the value Alice sent as p.

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
So that's how the first login works.

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Now the question is, the next time Alice logs in, what does she need to send?

24
00:01:19,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Here's the choices. Different number of times of doing the hash starting from the secret s.
