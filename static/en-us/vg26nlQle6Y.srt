1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:05,220
A graphical version of the decision table is called a decision tree.

2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:10,350
It's a form of a flow chart in which the decisions are taken sequentially and

3
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:15,340
the resulting output can be seen as a path through the tree.

4
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:18,550
It's exactly the same information as in the decision tree, but

5
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:20,730
you're seeing it in a different form.

6
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:24,830
In the decision tree we'll see in just a second, there are two kinds of nodes.

7
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:29,330
Diamonds denote decisions and rectangles denote the actions that are going to be

8
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:31,250
taken based upon the decisions that are made.

9
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:35,900
The arcs in the diagram indicate the implications when a decision is

10
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:39,469
answered in a particular way, either affirmatively or negatively.

11
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:44,500
Note that in the decision tree you're about to see,

12
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:47,030
some of the nodes have been duplicated.

13
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:55,740
This is a side effect of the redundancy which occurs in the table as well.

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,580
Here's the tree for the previous situation.

15
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:04,269
On the left is the decision about the master control and

16
00:01:04,269 --> 00:01:08,760
the on, on the rightmost is the resultant

17
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:13,920
response from the system in terms of what lights are on and what lights are off.

18
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:17,480
Once again, same information is in the decision table.

19
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:25,600
Note that the two rightmost diamonds contain exactly the same question.

20
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,250
And that's it for combinatorial combinatorial logic.

21
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:32,640
As you can well imagine, as the number of possibilities for

22
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,470
the input goes up, these tables quickly become unmanage, unmanageable.
