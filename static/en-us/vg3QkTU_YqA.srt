1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Now, we're going to learn how to specify important parts of HTML and JavaScript,

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
and, in an incredible surprise move, we're going to do this specification

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
using regular expressions.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Just a quick reminder, an outline of the overall project,

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:24,000
we want to start with a web page and then break it down into important words.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Maybe the less than and the greater than sign used for the tag are important words,

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
the 1, the plus, and the 2, but we're largely ignoring this sort of white space

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
or these new line characters.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Then we want to take those words and diagram them into this cool tree-like structure.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Of course, this tree is growing upside down, but that won't be a problem at all.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Finally, we're going to interpret that tree to figure out what it means to get the result.
