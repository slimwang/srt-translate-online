1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,400
So, let's see what happens if
we execute this block of code

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,250
on this cursor variable
containing all this data and

3
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:11,250
see what the integer value of
the result variable is returned.

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:14,880
So, here's the cursor variable that we
started with, and our initial line of

5
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:19,260
code has us move to the first row of
the cursor, which is this row here.

6
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:23,630
Following we have the moveToNext method,
which advances the cursor

7
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:27,270
one row from its current position,
and then we have that call again, and

8
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:31,390
our cursor advances one more row
to this third row down here.

9
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:34,170
Following we have these
two Java statements.

10
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:40,050
They get us the column index of first
the name column, which we see here is 0,

11
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:44,080
so the name column index
variable is set to 0, and

12
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:48,350
we also have the weightColumnIndex
variable that is set to 1.

13
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:52,600
Finally, the last line of code here
passes in the weightColumnIndex,

14
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,540
which we previously saw is 1, and

15
00:00:55,540 --> 00:01:00,030
in this cursor passing in 1
gives us the value of 30.

16
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:04,349
So, the value of result here,
this variable, will be 30.

17
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:08,670
Back to the exercise, this blank here,
our result would be the 30,

18
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:11,540
which is the weight of
the value in our third row.
