00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:04,410
Did you know that you can find out how
many layers you've got in a website?

2
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:08,710
Of course for this, it's once again
time to head over into Chrome def tools.

3
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:10,550
I'm looking at the parallax demo and

4
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:14,775
I've already will changed all
the blobs with the paint profiler on.

5
00:00:14,775 --> 00:00:16,184
So I'd check this box.

6
00:00:16,184 --> 00:00:18,995
I'll go ahead and
start a recording and scroll the page.

7
00:00:19,995 --> 00:00:23,725
I've opened devtools in a separate
window to get a little bit more space.

8
00:00:23,725 --> 00:00:26,575
Notice how each frame has
a gray bar at the top.

9
00:00:26,575 --> 00:00:29,195
You now have the ability to see
all the layers on the screen.

10
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:33,500
And why, for each layer,
it was composited into its own layer.

11
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:37,330
At the top, you've got a few
looking around and rotating tools.

12
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:38,810
For instance, with this one checked,

13
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:43,430
I can now rotate the page to get
a 3D view of all the layers.

14
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:44,590
Pretty cool?

15
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:48,220
Anyways, when I click on one of the
layers, I can see exactly why it became

16
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:51,170
a layer which, in this case,
is because it has will change.

17
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:53,380
Now it's your turn to
try counting layers.

18
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:56,842
Head to this link which you can
find in the instructor notes below.

19
00:00:56,842 --> 00:01:00,580
Re size the window or zoom in far enough
so that you have the ability to scroll.

20
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:05,450
Click on the click me button and then
record a timeline trace of scrolling.

21
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:09,030
And of course make sure
the paint profiler is enabled.

22
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:10,350
I've got two questions for you.

23
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:14,060
The first one is how
many layers are there?

24
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:17,860
But don't worry about counting document,
type your answer into this box.

25
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:21,560
And the second question is
why was totes promoted?

26
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,155
Was it because it has will change?

27
00:01:23,155 --> 00:01:27,820
Was it because tote's promoted overlaps
with some other composited content?

28
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:30,665
Is it because it has a 3D
transform applied to it?

29
00:01:30,665 --> 00:01:35,320
It is it because totes promoted
is a hardware accelerated canvas?

30
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:38,960
Or is it because totes
promoted animates a transform?

31
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,078
Check one of these answers.
