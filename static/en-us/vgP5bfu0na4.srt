00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Let's talk a little bit about SQL, or "sequel," or structured query language.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
SQL is a language.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
It's not quite a programming language, but it's a language for expressing queries,

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
and so you would use SQL on a relational database

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
to ask questions of the database to get that out of it,

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
so MySQL, postgreSQL, SQLite.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Obviously they all have SQL in the name, and they all use SQL for

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
putting data into the database and getting data out.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
It was invented in the 1970s,

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
which was long before the internet existed or the Web existed

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
or web applications even existed,

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
so SQL was designed to solve problems that

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
are very much different from the problems you'll be solving

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
building a consumer web application.

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
There's still a lot of very important parts to SQL,

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
and we'll be discussing the major pieces today

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
so you can know how to use them, but just keep in mind that

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
SQL and relational databases have existed long before the Web,

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
and so there are some things that aren't exactly relevant.

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
SQL looks a little something like this.

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
This is a basic SQL query,

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
and what this says is select,

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
which basically means retrieve data, *,

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
this means all columns, from links, this is the table

25
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
that we're fetching data from, where, ID = 5,

26
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
and this is a constraint.

27
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
SQL, as you can see, it's a fairly readable language.

28
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Select all from links where ID = 5.

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
That's almost similar to the quiz I gave you earlier in this lesson.

30
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
There are a couple parts of this line that are relevant.

31
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
This first section, the select *,

32
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
this is basically what we're selecting.

33
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
The <i>can--instead of being a</i>--can actually be a list of columns,

34
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
but for a lot of things we're going to be doing, we'll be selecting all of the columns.

35
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
But if you don't want all of the columns, let's say you just wanted

36
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
just the URL from the links, it might look something like this:

37
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
select url, and you could put a comma, select url, title

38
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
if you wanted to select just the URL and the title.

39
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
But we'll be using * for now.

40
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Now from, this is the from clause right here.

41
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
This is where we're going to fetch the data from,

42
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
so we've only talked about really one table, our links table,

43
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
and in my example, that's what I'm going to use.

44
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
But you can actually include any table of your making or multiple tables,

45
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
and we'll talk briefly about what that means a little bit later,

46
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
but for now, we're just going to be selecting from the links table,

47
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
and that's the name of the table we made.

48
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Where, now the rest of the SQL, or the rest of the SQL you can see here,

49
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
this is the where clause, and these are the constraints.

50
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
These are which rows from our table to return,

51
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
and this is actually a really interesting part of the statement here.

52
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
We can actually put quite a lot in here.

53
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Let's play around with this a little bit in the IDE and see how it works.
