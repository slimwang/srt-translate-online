1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,180
So, we've set up the rules for
figuring out when GigaGal

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:06,540
lands on the top of a platform and
when she misses the edge.

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:09,910
We do so by looking at GigaGal's
position in the last frame,

4
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:12,110
and her position in the current frame.

5
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:15,450
So, in this diagram, the base of
the arrow is her position last frame,

6
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:17,370
the head of the arrow is
her position this frame.

7
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:21,580
In which of these cases does GigaGal
land on top of this platform?
