00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:02,663
By now, you've learned about many different tools that we can use to get

2
00:00:02,663 --> 00:00:06,606
polynomials into their full factored forms. Sometimes, we can just pull a

3
00:00:06,606 --> 00:00:10,858
common factor out of all the terms in an equation. Other times, we need to use

4
00:00:10,858 --> 00:00:14,520
the rational zero theorem in conjunction with polynomial long division. In the

5
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:17,234
event that we have a second degree polynomial, we can use the quadratic

6
00:00:17,234 --> 00:00:22,928
formula. All of these methods tell us about exact values of roots. But in the

7
00:00:22,928 --> 00:00:25,918
event that we're having trouble finding these exact values, we can always use

8
00:00:25,918 --> 00:00:29,233
the intermediate value theorem to approximate zeroes.
