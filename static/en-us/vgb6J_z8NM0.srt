1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,692
Now we're ready for a quiz where you're going to define a procedure yourself.

2
00:00:04,692 --> 00:00:10,000
Your goal is to define a procedure named square that takes 1 number as its input

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and outputs the square of that number.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
What I mean by square is the result of multiplying the input number by itself.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,754
See if you can define a procedure that does that.

6
00:00:19,754 --> 00:00:23,000
If it's correct, you should get results like this.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
So if you do print the result of square(5), the output that's printed should be 25.
