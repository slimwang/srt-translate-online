When you have used programming
languages before such as Python or

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:07,550
JavaScript, you've been exposed to
concepts such as function and statement.

3
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:10,070
Commands that you run at the shell
prompt are a little bit like

4
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:11,360
function calls.

5
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,390
>> You could even do some of
the same things in the shell and

6
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:16,710
in code, like the command to
delete a file in the shell is rm,

7
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:19,860
which stands for remove And
it works like this.

8
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:23,805
>> And you could do the same thing in
Python with the remove function in

9
00:00:23,805 --> 00:00:25,578
the OS module, os.remove.

10
00:00:25,578 --> 00:00:29,284
>> So, this analogy helps some people
think about commands in the shell.

11
00:00:29,284 --> 00:00:31,397
If it doesn't work for
you, that' okay, too.

12
00:00:31,397 --> 00:00:34,138
But take a moment to think about how
shell commands are similar to functions

13
00:00:34,138 --> 00:00:36,630
in Python or JavaScript, and
think about how they're different.
