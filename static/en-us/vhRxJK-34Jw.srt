1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:05,203
As we'll see later on, electronic
prescribing or e-prescribing for

2
00:00:05,203 --> 00:00:10,500
short is a key requirement of the new
federal EHR adoption programs.

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,930
Because electronic prescriptions
are clear and legible and

4
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:17,980
an EMR can often spot potential
problems as prescriptions are written.

5
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:21,960
E-Prescribing has been shown to
dramatically reduce medication errors

6
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,040
within a year of being adopted.

7
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:29,960
As you can see here they decline from
42.5 per 100 descriptions to 6.6

8
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:34,675
within a year of this practice, or the
typical practice adopting e-prescribing.

9
00:00:34,675 --> 00:00:38,410
While of course they remain the same
in those practices that continued

10
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:40,140
to manually prescribe.

11
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:44,280
Someday soon hopefully, each provider
will have a full medication record,

12
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,440
including whether patients
are filling their prescriptions and

13
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,240
then refilling them at
the proper interval.

14
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,490
Both are currently major problems.

15
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:57,910
Currently patient privacy concerns, the
topic of lesson four are an impediment

16
00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:00,930
to routinely and automatically
providing this information.
