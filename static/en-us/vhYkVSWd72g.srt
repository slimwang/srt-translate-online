1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:01,760
>> The thing that I find most useful in

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:04,290
trying to understand the folk theorem and, and what

3
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:09,200
it says and how it works is a thing that I call a two-player plot. I don't know

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,400
if other people have other names for it, but

5
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,730
this, this concept is out and, and often discussed.

6
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:16,970
I just don't know what it's called [LAUGH]. But

7
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:18,630
here's the idea of it, it's a really simple idea.

8
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:19,870
>> It's like a folk plot.

9
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:22,150
>> It is a, it is a folk, a folk plot, right,

10
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:25,168
I don't know who invented this plot. So here's what we're going to do,

11
00:00:25,168 --> 00:00:26,856
remember this prisoner's dilemma game. We've

12
00:00:26,856 --> 00:00:29,634
got two players, there's Smoove and Curly.

13
00:00:29,634 --> 00:00:30,566
>> Mm-hm.

14
00:00:30,566 --> 00:00:32,490
>> And, what we're going to do, is

15
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:35,598
we're, there's a bunch of joint, actions that

16
00:00:35,598 --> 00:00:39,840
they can take. So Smoove cooperates and

17
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,770
Curly defects, or they both defect, or they

18
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:44,790
both cooperate, or one defects defect cooperate

19
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:46,353
in the other direction. So what we're going to

20
00:00:46,353 --> 00:00:48,102
do is for each of those joint outcomes,

21
00:00:48,102 --> 00:00:50,534
each of those joint action choices. I'm going to

22
00:00:50,534 --> 00:00:54,388
plot a dot, put a dot on a two-dimensional plot, where

23
00:00:54,388 --> 00:00:58,491
this is the Smoove axis, and this is the Curly axis, okay.

24
00:00:58,491 --> 00:00:59,720
>> Okay.

25
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:01,982
>> So cooperate-cooperate, remember from the

26
00:01:01,982 --> 00:01:04,360
prisoner, prisoner dilemma payoffs, is minus

27
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:08,007
one, minus one. So I put a dot at minus one, minus one.

28
00:01:08,007 --> 00:01:12,860
Defect, defect. Is it minus six, minus six? Cooperate defect is it minus

29
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:15,780
nine zero? And defect cooperate, is it zero minus nine? . So do

30
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:18,310
those four points make sense to you? Do you understand like the idea?

31
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:19,500
>> They do.

32
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:22,236
>> It may not be so obvious why we do, do it this

33
00:01:22,236 --> 00:01:25,890
way, because as you have told us, the matrix is all you need.

34
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:26,971
>> Mm-hm.

35
00:01:26,971 --> 00:01:31,170
>> But this is really just representing the matrix in another form.

36
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:35,062
But it actually is sort of losing some information. Because these dots

37
00:01:35,062 --> 00:01:37,798
don't tell us what the relationship is in terms of if, if

38
00:01:37,798 --> 00:01:40,819
one player keeps the same action and the other player changes to

39
00:01:40,819 --> 00:01:43,120
a different action. The matrix captures that but

40
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,030
this plot doesn't anymore, it's kind of washed out.

41
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:45,720
>> I see.
