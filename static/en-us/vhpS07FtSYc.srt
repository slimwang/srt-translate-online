00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,740
Now, Box2D was originally written in C++, horded the action script, and used in

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:10,871
hundreds of games. Including the incredibly popular Angry Birds. And recently

3
00:00:10,871 --> 00:00:13,829
the action script version of Box2D has also been converted further to

4
00:00:13,829 --> 00:00:18,399
JavaScript by Jonas Wagner. For grits, we grab the JavaScript part of Box2D

5
00:00:18,399 --> 00:00:23,244
from the Intertubes and placed it into our source folder. Now, if you have

6
00:00:23,244 --> 00:00:27,836
further questions about the Box2D API that we don't answer here. We recommend

7
00:00:27,836 --> 00:00:32,049
you take a look at the Box2D manual shown here, and linked below. It was

8
00:00:32,049 --> 00:00:36,132
written for the Flash version, but the concepts translate. Now, the first thing

9
00:00:36,132 --> 00:00:40,893
we need to do to use Box2DJS is to load it into the Dom. And we do that, using

10
00:00:40,893 --> 00:00:43,690
this fairly simple script tag.
