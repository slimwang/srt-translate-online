1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,590
Okay, let's take a look at the code.

2
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:06,560
So, in order_dinner.xml,
which is the layout file for

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:11,090
the order dinner screen,
I've added the button for the payment.

4
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:18,400
So, text=Payment, given it it's unique
ID and the onClick is getPaymentInfo.

5
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,400
And it starts out being invisible.

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:25,370
Up here, in order dinner activity,
I've defined getPaymentInfo

7
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:29,700
which glosses right over getting
the payment and just shows us a toast.

8
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:32,650
But then I call a method to
send hit to Analytics and

9
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:36,290
here's the code to show and
hide the buttons appropriately.

10
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:38,120
And then here's sendPaymentInfoHit.

11
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:39,970
This is all very familiar.

12
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:42,410
We create the product etc.

13
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:48,320
Now down here in the productAction,
the action is ACTION_CHECKOUT_OPTION and

14
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,500
I've set the CheckoutStep to 2.

15
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:51,650
Get the tracker.

16
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:56,930
And when I create the EventBuilder,
categorize shopping steps as before,

17
00:00:56,930 --> 00:00:59,950
change the action to Get payment,
add the product,

18
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:03,950
set the productAction and build the hit.
