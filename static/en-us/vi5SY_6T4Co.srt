1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Now we have a set of predictions that might arise from a single particle,

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
and the other important step in particle filtering is the measurement step.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
We need to understand at what rate will these particles survive,

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
and that's usually done in proportion to the measurement probabilities.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Let's talk about measurements.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
For the sake of this exercise, let's assume we only have 2 measurements.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
We would either see something bright or something dark.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
It does a certain response to whether it's on land marking.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Just for simplicity, let's assume we have certain locations that have land markings,

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
like this one over here and these over there.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
If a robot center is aligned with a lane marking, it should see a bright spot

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
because lane markings tend to be bright.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
But if it's off the lane marking on the regular road, it should see a dark spot.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Let's turn this into a probability that's called the measurement probability.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The probability of seeing something bright is going to be large when it's on a lane marker, say 0.8.

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
From that we can deduce that the probability of seeing something dark on a lane marker is 0.2.

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:17,000
The probability of seeing something dark when off a lane marker is even higher at 0.9,

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
and from that it follows that the probability of seeing something bright

19
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:27,000
on the regular road with regular pavement is going to be 1 minus 0.9 equals 0.1.

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Here's my quiz for you. This is an entirely nontrivial quiz.

21
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
If you get this right, you understand particle filters.

22
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Suppose we measure bright.

23
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
The actual sensor told us it saw something bright underneath the robot.

24
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I'd like to know what is the importance weight of the particle over here,

25
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,000
which we're going to call x1, and the particle over here, which I'll call x2.

26
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Tell me what's the weight w of x1 after I apply the measurement probability

27
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
and the normalization that's common in particle filters.

28
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Please do the same for the particle x2 where x1 happens to be on the lane marker,

29
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
and x2 happens to be off a lane marker.

30
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
So please put in these two numbers of over here.

31
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
It'll take a while to calculate those, so please take the time.

32
00:02:22,000 --> 99:59:59,999
I assure you if you get those right, you really understand particle filters.
