1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Let's continue with our example.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
We're testing the square root routine, and now we're going to test it with the input value of -1.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
So we call square root of -1, and the question is, what should it return?

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Let's make this into another little quiz.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Our possible answers are a) 1; b) i; c) not a number; d) throw some sort of an exception;

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
e) -1; and f) just crash the machine.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
And so here's a text box for you, and I'd like you to type in all of the letters that apply

8
00:00:31,000 --> 99:59:59,999
as reasonable results for square root of -1.
