1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:04,030
Currently, I'm in the
BreakpointBugViewController.swiftfile

2
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:06,000
of the SoManyBugs app.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,840
I want to know the state of our
application when a user taps the screen

4
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:10,690
to create a new spider.

5
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:15,620
And I'll do this by setting a Breakpoint
in the handle single tap method.

6
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:19,500
First I'll go down to the method
handleSingleTap, and then I can create

7
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:23,270
the breakpoint by clicking in
the gutter, left to the main code area.

8
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:26,520
If you accidentally place
the breakpoint in the wrong place,

9
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:30,260
you can remove it by clicking and
dragging it off like this.

10
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:33,160
But let's go ahead and
keep our breakpoint here for now.

11
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:36,620
When you create breakpoints this way by
clicking in the gutter next to a line of

12
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:40,720
code, we'd say that we're creating line,
or instruction breakpoints.

13
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:44,510
If you can't see the line numbers
currently, go to Xcode, and

14
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:46,390
then Preferences.

15
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:47,570
Go to Text Editing and

16
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:51,800
then make sure that you have the
checkbox selected next to line numbers.

17
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:55,470
Another way to access the breakpoints
that we're setting is by looking at

18
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:59,430
the Breakpoints Navigator in
the Navigator side panel.

19
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:03,330
This is the second to last
icon in the Navigator panel.

20
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:06,000
Optionally, you can use the key
Command Seven hotkey to

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,040
display the breakpoint navigator.

22
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,460
In this view,
we can see the breakpoints that we set.

23
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:15,650
So right now we have a breakpoint set in
the handle single tap method on line 85.

24
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:19,790
And it's in the
breakpointbugviewcontroller.swift file.

25
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:21,660
We can toggle these breakpoints on and

26
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:24,750
off here by clicking on
the breakpoint icon.

27
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:26,510
And in the same way in the code,

28
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:30,120
you can click on the break point
icon to toggle it on and off.

29
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:33,279
So let's keep this breakpoint active for
now, and run the app and

30
00:01:33,279 --> 00:01:34,208
see what happens.
