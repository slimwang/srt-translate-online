00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:03,630
Unity encapsulates an object's position,
rotation, and

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:06,820
scale into a structure
called a transform.

3
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:08,410
Check out these books
sitting on a table.

4
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:12,160
I've written a little program
to show you the transform for

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,320
these books, as I manipulate them.

6
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,749
When the books go up in the air,
you see their Y position increase.

7
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:21,870
I should note a couple of things here,
first,

8
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:26,600
when I talk about the y position,
I'm referring to Cartesian coordinates.

9
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:29,280
Hopefully, that's
familiar from math class.

10
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:33,590
Unity uses something called a left
handed coordinate system, it looks like

11
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:39,090
this, a left handed coordinate system,
just means that the positive y-axis

12
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:45,300
is up, positive x is right,
and positive z is forward.

13
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:48,280
The second thing I should note
is we're working in meters

14
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:49,670
throughout this course.

15
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:53,310
It's very important to work in real
world coordinates when developing VR

16
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:55,850
software, we'll talk
more about that later.

17
00:00:56,930 --> 00:01:00,259
Anyway when the books are rotated,
you see their angle's change.

18
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:07,030
Unity allows you to view and manipulate
rotations in a lot of different ways.

19
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:09,490
In this case,
we're looking at Euler angles.

20
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:14,890
Each one of these numbers corresponds
to the rotation around the given axis.

21
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:18,570
It looks like this,
this is a rotation around the z axis,

22
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:23,600
this a rotation around the y axis, and
this is a rotation around the x axis.

23
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,080
When I rotate the books
around the y axis,

24
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:28,850
you can see it continually update below.

25
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:33,570
When the books are scaled,
you see the scale value increase.

26
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:37,970
The scale is a multiplier,
if it is set to one,

27
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:41,110
then the object is set to
its original starting size.

28
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:45,930
Setting the scale to 2.0 doubles
the object's size relative to its

29
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:47,320
starting size.

30
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,960
So, that's the basic theory.

31
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,220
Now, let's see it in practice.
