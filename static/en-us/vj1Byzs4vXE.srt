1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:04,520
Remember in lesson one, we learned that
A B testing is a type of experiment

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:09,150
with two variants, A and B,
which are the Control and Variation.

3
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:12,330
However, in this experiment,
we have three variants.

4
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:14,020
The Control stores, and

5
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:18,819
the stores with facials offered at
$76.99, and those offered at $87.99.

6
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:24,300
Additionally, the stores
are spread across three regions.

7
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:28,430
To properly match our control and
treatment units, we'll need to separate

8
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:33,600
our data so we're really performing two
AB analyses, one for each price point.

9
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,090
Therefore, we need to create a data
table that shows the stores,

10
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:44,060
the region, and the group the store
was in, Control or treatment, and

11
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:46,350
if treatment,
what was the price of the facial?
