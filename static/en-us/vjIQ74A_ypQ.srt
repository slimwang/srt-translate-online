1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,860
In the verged case, drawn here, you can take a look at

2
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:06,320
the epipolar lines by considering a couple of different points.

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:09,820
So remember, each point defines a pair of epipolar lines, and

4
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:11,150
here they're drawn.

5
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:16,180
And so here's an example of epipolar lines of two verged cameras.

6
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:21,070
And what that means is, that, for example, this point here since it's on,

7
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:25,070
this happens to be on this line, must be somewhere on that line, and

8
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:28,790
in fact, there it is, okay, and this point here.

9
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:32,220
Now, only a few lines are drawn here, of course, if I was looking for

10
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:35,930
this point here, there's some epipolar line, because there's some point here

11
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:40,120
that defines an epipolar plane, and there would be a corresponding epipolar line

12
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:43,280
on the other side, we've only drawn in a few of them.

13
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,880
So, here's a question for you.

14
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:49,890
We said that all the epipolar lines converge at the epipole,

15
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:51,780
well where's the epipole?

16
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:54,640
Well, let's take a look at just this image on the right.

17
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,570
The problem is, is that this image ended here.

18
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:00,390
If this image were huge, this line and

19
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:04,050
then this line, here's where they would intersect, okay?

20
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:07,240
So the problem is, is that the, the image, if you will, is sort of cropped,

21
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:10,090
the image sensor is too small to actually find the epipole.

22
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:13,640
The epipole is a mathematical construct that's the intersection

23
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:18,360
of the baseline with the infinite plane that contains the image plane.

24
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:23,010
So that's why the, the epipole lines look like they would converge, but

25
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:25,450
they they do it off the screen.
