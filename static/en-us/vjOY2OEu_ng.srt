1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Let's say we performed that search.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
We had a big search tree, and then we threw out

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
all the branches except one, and this branch of the search tree

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
does itself have branches, but this branch of the search tree

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
through the belief state represents a single plan,

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
not multiple possible plans.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Now, what I want to know is, for this single plan,

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
what can we guarantee about it?

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
So, say we wanted to know is this plan guaranteed to find the goal

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
in an unbounded number of steps?

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
And what do we need to guarantee that?

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
So, it's an unbounded solution.

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Do we need to guarantee that

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
some leaf node is a goal?

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
So, for example, here's a plan to go through,

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
and at the bottom, there's a leaf node.

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Now, if this were in problem solving,

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
then remember, it would be a sequence of steps

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
with no branches in it, and we know it's a solution

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
if the one leaf node is a goal.

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
But for these with branches, do we need to guarantee

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
that some leaf is a goal,

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
or do we need to guarantee

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
that every leaf is a goal,

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
or is there no possible guarantee

26
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
that will mean that for sure we've got a solution,

27
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
although the solution may be of unbounded length?

28
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Then I also want you to answer

29
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
what does it take to guarantee

30
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
that we have a bounded solution?

31
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
That is, a solution that is guaranteed to reach the goal

32
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
in a bounded, finite number of steps.

33
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Do we need to have a plan that has

34
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
no branches in it, like this branch?

35
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Or a plan that has no loops in it,

36
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
like this loop that goes back to a previous state?

37
00:02:05,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Or is there no guarantee that we have a bounded solution?
