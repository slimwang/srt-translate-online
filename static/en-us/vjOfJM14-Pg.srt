1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
We're going to talk about more advanced issues on random testing.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
And so we're going to talk about things like test oracles.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This is always a big issue when we're using random testing.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
We're going to talk about how random testing fits into the bigger picture--that is to say how ideally

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
a random tester that you develop will sort of co-evolve with the software that is testing.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
They can both strengthen each other over time.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
We're also going to talk about perhaps the trickiest topic of all in random testing

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
which is tweaking and tuning the rules and probabilities involved in making

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
a random test case so that they'll actually do a good job.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
And so together these issues and some others that we're going to cover, constitute what I would sort of think

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
of as kind of advanced random testing issues.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
What these are going to do is give you a basis for creating a really strong random test case generators.
