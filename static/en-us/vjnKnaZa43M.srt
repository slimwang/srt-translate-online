1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,802
To calculate this answer we multiply for Chris.

2
00:00:03,802 --> 00:00:08,781
The LOVE and DEAL probability is .8 .1 just as before and

3
00:00:08,781 --> 00:00:11,379
multiply in the prior of .5.

4
00:00:11,379 --> 00:00:16,840
And product of the .1 times .8 times .5 is 0.04.

5
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:19,920
The math changes for SARA.

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,598
She was as would LOVE with .5 probability.

7
00:00:22,598 --> 00:00:27,253
DEAL with .2, and again our prior is 0.5.

8
00:00:27,253 --> 00:00:29,770
Give us 0.05.

9
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:35,051
Now, to normalize them to bring them into a form where they add up to 1,

10
00:00:35,051 --> 00:00:38,496
we realize that the sum right now is 0.09.

11
00:00:38,496 --> 00:00:46,082
So we have to divide 0.04 by 0.09 and that gives us 0.444.

12
00:00:46,082 --> 00:00:48,390
An approximation.

13
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:51,603
And the 5 gives us 0.555.

14
00:00:51,603 --> 00:00:56,821
If we add them up you might get 0.99999 or 1.
