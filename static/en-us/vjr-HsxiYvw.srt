Our previous box factory pipeline had just three stages. Say, we were able to

2
00:00:04,866 --> 00:00:10,532
split each of these stages in half, and each takes 5 seconds. So, instead of 1

3
00:00:10,532 --> 00:00:15,941
cutter we have 2 cutters, 2 folders and 2 tapers. The time to take a single box

4
00:00:15,941 --> 00:00:20,159
is still 30 seconds. At what rate do boxes come off this pipeline?
