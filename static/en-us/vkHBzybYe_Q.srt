1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:03,535
In all of the piecewise functions we've looked at so far, the endpoints of each

2
00:00:03,535 --> 00:00:08,182
of the segments have matched up with one another exactly. Which makes the

3
00:00:08,182 --> 00:00:12,084
graphs continuous. There are no breaks. Now when this is the case, we can

4
00:00:12,084 --> 00:00:16,402
choose to include these boundary values. These values of x where we switch from

5
00:00:16,402 --> 00:00:20,502
one part of the function to the other. To be in either of the two parts of the

6
00:00:20,502 --> 00:00:24,356
function that come together at that point. We don't want any over lapse

7
00:00:24,356 --> 00:00:28,660
however. So in the case of this last function we were looking at. We initially

8
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:32,759
included that x equals 0 point. In the probable part of the function. Which is

9
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:37,723
why we had 0 is less than or equal to x is less than 3. As the domain, for this

10
00:00:37,723 --> 00:00:42,429
middle piece of the function. We could however instead, include 0 in this first

11
00:00:42,429 --> 00:00:47,260
linear part, the negative one half of x minus 4 part of the function. If we

12
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:50,822
decide to pursue that, we'd have to switch off our inequalities over here. So

13
00:00:50,822 --> 00:00:55,011
instead of having 0 is less than or equal to x right here you have 0 is less

14
00:00:55,011 --> 00:01:00,915
than X. I would switch the equal to part to be here over. So domain for this

15
00:01:00,915 --> 00:01:05,123
first line is negative five is less than or equal to x, less than or equal to

16
00:01:05,123 --> 00:01:10,118
0. We could do the same thing with x equals 3. And now we can see it's

17
00:01:10,118 --> 00:01:14,234
contained in the f of x equals x minus four portions. This line right here. We

18
00:01:14,234 --> 00:01:17,654
could instead, include it in the parabola if we just made x is less than or

19
00:01:17,654 --> 00:01:22,083
equal to 3. Instead of x is less than 3, and if we just switch this to less

20
00:01:22,083 --> 00:01:26,891
than sign. Sometimes however, piecewise functions aren't continuous. They often

21
00:01:26,891 --> 00:01:31,556
have breaks in them. But sometimes Piecewise Functions aren't continuous. They

22
00:01:31,556 --> 00:01:35,540
often have breaks in them, as you can see in the two functions I've drawn here.

23
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:38,516
Now, if you want to show that a certain point is not defined on a function, or

24
00:01:38,516 --> 00:01:43,462
in other words, if you want to exclude its X coordinate from the domain. We

25
00:01:43,462 --> 00:01:46,360
just draw a little open circle at that point like I've done in several places

26
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:50,134
here. Now, for each of these two piecewise functions here, I'd like you to

27
00:01:50,134 --> 00:01:54,243
decide which of these end points should stay open. And which ones should be

28
00:01:54,243 --> 00:01:57,281
filled on, based of course on how I've defined the domains for either of the

29
00:01:57,281 --> 00:02:01,815
functions. If you think an endpoint should be filled in, just click the circle

30
00:02:01,815 --> 00:02:05,670
that's at that endpoint. And if you want it to stay open, then just leave it

31
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:09,810
open. Don't mark it. To double-check your work, you can make sure that there's

32
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:13,010
no x value on either of these graphs that belongs to two different parts of the

33
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:14,899
functions.
