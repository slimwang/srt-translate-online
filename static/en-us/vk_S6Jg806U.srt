00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:04,308
Next, we are going to look at how to enter the numbers we've been talking about

2
00:00:04,308 --> 00:00:09,927
into a calculator and convert from scientific notation. For example, 3 times 10

3
00:00:09,927 --> 00:00:14,372
the 3rd to a notation we usually use 3000. Now, your calculator may differ a

4
00:00:14,372 --> 00:00:18,445
bit from the one that I'm going to use. And I would encourage you to use your

5
00:00:18,445 --> 00:00:23,000
own calculator, or choose Google calculator, like I'm going to. Let's think

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,432
about the number, 5 times 10 to the 2nd. If you take this into a scientific

7
00:00:27,432 --> 00:00:30,888
calculator, and then pressed Enter, what number do you think the calculator

8
00:00:30,888 --> 00:00:32,728
would show you?
