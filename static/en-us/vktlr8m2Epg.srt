One afternoon, as she was walking around in downtown Udacity, Athena happened

2
00:00:04,356 --> 00:00:08,778
upon a soda machine. And it looked so enticing that she decided to grab a drink.

3
00:00:08,778 --> 00:00:13,489
All the drinks from the soda machine cost $1.00. She put a dollar in the machine

4
00:00:13,489 --> 00:00:18,116
slot, pressed a button for which drink she wanted. And voila, out came a soda.

5
00:00:18,116 --> 00:00:22,463
She tasted her drink and since it was so delicious, she decided to buy one for

6
00:00:22,463 --> 00:00:26,799
her brother too, since she was about to stop by his house. So, she put another

7
00:00:26,799 --> 00:00:30,965
dollar in the machine and she got a second can of soda for him. Now, since the

8
00:00:30,965 --> 00:00:35,689
price per soda has the set value, a constant, of $1. What are two variable that

9
00:00:35,689 --> 00:00:39,905
we could very easily related to one another with an equation that uses this

10
00:00:39,905 --> 00:00:44,538
constant? Please pick two of these five choices down here. Would you want to use

11
00:00:44,538 --> 00:00:49,126
level of thirstiness, amount of money Athena puts in the machine, how hard

12
00:00:49,126 --> 00:00:53,936
Athena presses the button, how many brothers Athena has, or how many sodas the

13
00:00:53,936 --> 00:00:58,170
machine spits out? Which two of these belong together along with this constant

14
00:00:58,170 --> 00:00:58,674
of $1.00?
