1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,310
Okay, so we've got our awesome
prototype, and we've got our excitement.

2
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:06,170
And we know what information we want to
get out of the user research process.

3
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:07,720
We're all ready to go.

4
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:11,190
The only problem is we haven't
found any users to test with yet.

5
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:13,170
Where do we find those users?

6
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:15,220
Remember the idea of
circles of feedback?

7
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:16,360
In this version of the app,

8
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:19,050
we're going to target the circle
that is closest to you.

9
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:21,680
That means friends, family or coworkers.

10
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,760
However, we don't want just anyone.

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,070
Some people don't always
give good feedback.

12
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:28,840
For instance, my dad will pretty
much always tell me that anything I

13
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:30,950
build is great, so
I can't rely on him for

14
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:32,619
feedback on what's
wrong with an app idea.

15
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:37,635
Also, people who are technical or design
focused will often delve straight into

16
00:00:37,635 --> 00:00:40,930
solutions without giving
their raw reactions.

17
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:43,640
This means that their feedback is
often less valuable at this stage.

18
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:47,600
The ideal person to ask for feedback
on the app concept and execution

19
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,400
is someone close to you who does not
build app or design apps on their own.

20
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,960
If you work in an office, HR and

21
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,890
marketing can often give
really good user feedback.

22
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:58,060
If you don't,
you can often find a family member or

23
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:01,010
friend who is not in
the business of building apps.

24
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:04,910
Oh, and one more thing, be sure that
this is someone you have easy access to.

25
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:06,600
Prototyping is a fast process, and

26
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,350
you'll want to get feedback
as soon as possible.

27
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:12,380
Ideally, this is someone you
can talk to later today.

28
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:15,480
A family member in a faraway land
is not going to be quite as helpful

29
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,930
as your neighbor who
you can talk to now.
