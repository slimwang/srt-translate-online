1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:01,938
So let's analyze the complexity here.

2
00:00:01,938 --> 00:00:04,274
So the word complexity is possibly a function

3
00:00:04,274 --> 00:00:08,044
of both the number of vertices, V, and the number of edges, E.

4
00:00:08,044 --> 00:00:12,647
So the worst case, what is the portion of the word complexity that is a function of V,

5
00:00:12,647 --> 00:00:14,927
and what is a portion that's a function of E?

6
00:00:14,927 --> 00:00:17,537
So your choices are as a function of V,

7
00:00:17,537 --> 00:00:23,824
constant with respect to V, log V, linear, order of V, V log V, or V-squared.

8
00:00:23,824 --> 00:00:30,285
Similarly for E, constant order of 1, order of log E, order of E, order of E log E,

9
00:00:30,285 --> 00:00:33,249
and quadratic and E, order of E-squared.
