1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:04,990
So the Home screen is where you go to
see a list of your Analytics accounts.

2
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:07,450
For now, you've only got
one Analytics account, but

3
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:09,816
if you had more they'd show up here.

4
00:00:09,816 --> 00:00:14,696
And the Reportings dashboard is where
you'd go to see where in the world

5
00:00:14,696 --> 00:00:16,579
people are using your app.

6
00:00:16,579 --> 00:00:21,292
You go to the Admin dashboard
to see the Account Id.

7
00:00:21,292 --> 00:00:25,290
You go to the Reporting
dashboard to see real-time data.

8
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:27,850
Course, no users right now.

9
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:32,619
And you go to the Customization
dashboard to create custom reports.

10
00:00:32,619 --> 00:00:35,560
We won't be covering customized
reports in this course, but

11
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:38,505
it's helpful to have a high-level idea
of what each of the tabs are for.

12
00:00:38,505 --> 00:00:42,215
And if you want to give permission
to other people to use your account,

13
00:00:42,215 --> 00:00:46,380
you'd do that in the Admin dashboard
in the User Management section,

14
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:49,065
can add new users.

15
00:00:49,065 --> 00:00:50,455
So how did you do on that quiz?
