00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,469
Well, we're now using the sync adapter, and things are

2
00:00:03,469 --> 00:00:06,040
working pretty much as before. We want the app to do

3
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:08,710
this synchronization cleverly, and we'd like to get rid of

4
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:11,780
that old Refresh menu item. Let's start by cleaning up all

5
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:14,640
the other routines we have to sync. So we certainly

6
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:19,340
don't need any of this other stuff like FetchWeatherTask, or all

7
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:22,100
this stuff we did in Sunshine service, and we'll want to clean

8
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:25,170
up the manifest accordingly. We certainly don't need either one of

9
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:28,430
these anymore. And in Preferences, we can just change

10
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:30,880
that to sync immediately. So now we're really using this

11
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,380
sync adapter everywhere. We have a problem though. We're not

12
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:36,800
being very smart. The user still has all sorts of

13
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,070
places where they see an empty list. We want to

14
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:43,422
sync more intelligently. In Android 2.2 Froyo, Android added the

15
00:00:43,422 --> 00:00:47,890
ability to have sync adapter's sync periodically. We can add

16
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:50,580
a helper method to do this in our sync adapter.

17
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:53,270
The problem is, this method isn't as smart as

18
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:55,030
we'd like it to be, it still won't do all

19
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:57,800
that cool batching with exact repeating alarms that we'd

20
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:01,390
like it to. Fortunately, we've added something that does just

21
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:04,010
that, but it's not available until API level 19.

22
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:09,230
Taking advantage of flexible time to do inexact repeating arms,

23
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:12,780
let's set some nice defaults for our Sunshine sync adapter.

24
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:15,665
First we'll add these constants. To make things a little

25
00:01:15,665 --> 00:01:18,120
clearer in our code let's add another function

26
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,540
that we'll call when a new account is created,

27
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:23,148
and here we'll set some important flags. Such as

28
00:01:23,148 --> 00:01:25,309
configurePeriodicSync, the one we

29
00:01:25,309 --> 00:01:29,780
just created. SetSyncAutomatically, without which

30
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:32,890
our periodic sync will not be enabled. Since we're

31
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:35,830
just starting off let's do an immediate sync, then

32
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:37,790
we can call it from a strategic place and

33
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:40,904
get sync account. Finally, we can make the interface

34
00:01:40,904 --> 00:01:42,319
to the world a little bit cleaner by

35
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:46,880
adding an initializeSyncAdapter function. That's simply makes sure

36
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,170
that an account has been created. And now

37
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:51,620
inside of the main activity in the onCreate, we

38
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:53,140
can just make a call to that new

39
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:55,570
function. And it'll make sure that the parameters for

40
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:57,990
our sync adapter are set up correctly. Lets

41
00:01:57,990 --> 00:01:59,630
see if this has any impact on our emulator.

42
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:05,040
The new version of Sunshine right from the start shows all of current

43
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,840
weather. For a sync with a sync

44
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,530
adapter to happen successfully at periodic intervals

45
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:12,038
in the background you must: have a

46
00:02:12,038 --> 00:02:15,620
ContentProvider marked as syncable, enable automatic sync

47
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:18,470
for the SyncAdapter, do an initial immediate

48
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:21,120
sync, or set an interval in milliseconds.
