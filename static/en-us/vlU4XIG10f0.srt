1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,830
Let's look at the answer
to our locality quiz.

2
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:06,270
We were asked, which of these
are not good examples of locality?

3
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:08,330
The statement that it
rained three times today so

4
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:13,605
it will likely rain today again
is a decent example of locality.

5
00:00:13,605 --> 00:00:15,205
Usually if it rains often,

6
00:00:16,364 --> 00:00:18,965
it's probably going to just
continue raining often for a while.

7
00:00:20,385 --> 00:00:23,625
We ate dinner at 6 every day last week,
so

8
00:00:23,625 --> 00:00:26,837
probably we will eat dinner
around 6 this week too.

9
00:00:26,837 --> 00:00:28,667
This also tends to be true.

10
00:00:28,667 --> 00:00:31,947
People tend to eat meals around
the same time for a while.

11
00:00:33,167 --> 00:00:36,317
And finally,
it was New Year's Eye yesterday,

12
00:00:36,317 --> 00:00:39,837
so it will be probably be
New Year's Eve today too.

13
00:00:39,837 --> 00:00:43,497
This one is not a good
example of locality.

14
00:00:45,037 --> 00:00:45,762
Why?
Well,

15
00:00:45,762 --> 00:00:47,977
because some things
do not have locality.

16
00:00:47,977 --> 00:00:51,680
For example,
it being New Year's Eve one day

17
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,560
usually means that the next day
it won't be New Year's Eve,

18
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:59,870
because New Year's Eve is one of those
things that do not have much locality.

19
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:04,721
If it was yesterday,
then we know it's not going to be today,

20
00:01:04,721 --> 00:01:09,815
which is kind of opposite of what
the locality principle is about.

21
00:01:09,815 --> 00:01:14,522
As we can see, some things do
have the locality property and

22
00:01:14,522 --> 00:01:16,135
some things do not.
