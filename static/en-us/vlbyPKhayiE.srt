1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
[Man] The answers are the first sentence is valid.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
It's always true.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Why is that?

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Because every model has to have at least 1 object

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
and we can have both x and y refer to that same object,

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
and so that object must be equal to itself.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Second, let's see.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
The left-hand side of this implication has to be true.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
X is always equal to x,

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
and the right-hand side says for every y, does there exist a z

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
such that y equals z?

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
And we can say yes, there is.

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
We can always choose y itself for the value of z,

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
and then y = y, so true implies true.

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
That's always true.

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Valid.

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Third sentence: for all x, P of x or not P of x,

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
and that's always true because everything has to be either in the relation for P

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
or out of the relation for P, so that's valid.

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
And the fourth: there exists an x, P of x, and that's true for the models

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
in which there is some x that is a member of P,

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
but it doesn' t necessarily have to be any at all.

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
P might be an empty relation, so this is satisfiable.

24
00:01:16,000 --> 99:59:59,999
True in some models, but not true in all models.
