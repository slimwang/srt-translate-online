1
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:04,780
All right, so look, what I'm showing you
here was sort of a state of the art of

2
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:08,890
motion estimation 20 some odd
years ago for derivatives, and for

3
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:10,900
our first class where
you're starting to do this.

4
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:14,510
That's fine, we're not assuming you
have any background in computer vision.

5
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:19,048
But if you were actually to take
a look at work that's going on now,

6
00:00:19,048 --> 00:00:23,343
you will find motion estimation
that takes this as the basis and

7
00:00:23,343 --> 00:00:25,958
then it adds a lot of other stuff to it.

8
00:00:25,958 --> 00:00:29,364
So they worry about, sort of,
how the, the, the gradient behaves,

9
00:00:29,364 --> 00:00:31,240
the constancy of the gradient.

10
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:33,200
They have energy-minimization terms.

11
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,450
Remember we did energy minimization for
stereo?

12
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:37,890
And that came up to
be a better solution.

13
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:42,080
It not only had the local matches but
it also had more global structure to it.

14
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,910
It also does keypoint matching,

15
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:47,300
which is saying I've got something
that has moved a long distance.

16
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:51,540
So remember, the, the short distance,
the, the expansion works really well.

17
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:53,750
We have to do things hierarchically
to get the long distance.

18
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:56,860
Or, you could just use point to point,
right?

19
00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:01,590
I know this point went over here,
let me fill in the stuff behind it, or,

20
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:02,220
or around it.

21
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:05,209
And, when you do that, you get sort
of a much better result all together.

22
00:01:05,209 --> 00:01:09,494
And this is an image taken from
a paper that came out in 2009
