00:00:03,828 --> 00:00:07,852
empathy. And empathy is the ability to share other people's feelings and

3
00:00:07,852 --> 00:00:11,912
understand their situations. In fact, you may have used the term I totally

4
00:00:11,912 --> 00:00:16,574

5
00:00:16,574 --> 00:00:19,913
such as when our significant others experience pain, the parts of our brain

6
00:00:19,913 --> 00:00:25,762
associated with emotional pain are also activated. So this research shows that
