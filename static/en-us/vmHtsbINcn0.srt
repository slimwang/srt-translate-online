1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,219
So once again we're just going to use the
distributive property in the same way as

2
00:00:04,231 --> 00:00:08,463
we've done it many, many times before. The
difference this time and what may have

3
00:00:08,475 --> 00:00:12,750
confused some people, is that our factor,
our little a up here. If you can see, is

4
00:00:12,762 --> 00:00:17,090
actually two things multiplied together.
However that does not change the way that

5
00:00:17,102 --> 00:00:21,106
we use the distributive property at all.
As always the -5y, the factor out in

6
00:00:21,118 --> 00:00:25,660
front, is going to multiply each term
inside here, both the y And the z. So our

7
00:00:25,672 --> 00:00:30,550
first term is going to be -5y * y, and our
second term is just going to be -5y * z.

8
00:00:30,657 --> 00:00:35,945
Now again, I've just put an addition sign
between the two terms for simplicity right

9
00:00:35,957 --> 00:00:41,110
now, so that I can determine the sign of
each term within the term itself, and then

10
00:00:41,122 --> 00:00:45,948
change this to a - sign if I need to.
That's just a lot easier for me personally

11
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,606
to not get my signs mixed up. So now we
simplify within each term. And we end up

12
00:00:50,618 --> 00:00:56,106
with -5y^2 - 5yz. So you can see that no
matter how many things are multiplied

13
00:00:56,118 --> 00:01:01,085
together to create the factor that we have
out in front of our parentheses, they all

14
00:01:01,097 --> 00:01:04,057
multiply each of the terms within the
parentheses.
