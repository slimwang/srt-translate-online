1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
In this case, it's easy--it's this one, because it seems to describe the data almost perfectly

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
whereas the red one has substantially an error as does the green curve even more so.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Let's look at more data, which line would you pick?

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
The one in the middle, the red one, the blue one, or perhaps any of those.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Perhaps, it is all equally good. It turns out green is the right answer. Let's just look at this.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
The blue one suffers no loss for the three points over here

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
but a fairly substantial loss for the other three data points.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Let's call this loss c.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:38,000
So, the blue curve would have an error of 3c²--if this distance here is called c.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
The reason why it's squared is because we have three of those

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
and we're using the quadratic distance.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Similarly, the red one has the same problem, 3*c² for the red one.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Now, how about the green one? For the green one, we have errors for all six points.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:00,000
But now, the amount of the error itself is half as big as c. So, we're going to write (c/2)².

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:08,000
And when you work this out, you'll find that this is 6/4 c² is the same as 3/2 c².

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
So, the total error for the green one, the quadratic error,

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
is half as big as it is for the blue one and that's a surprise.

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
It has to do with the fact that in a quadratic version of the error,

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
large errors count much, much more than small errors.

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
So, green is the best regression line we can find for this data

21
00:01:25,000 --> 99:59:59,999
over here among the choices I've given you.
