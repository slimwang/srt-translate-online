1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,660
One more thing before we get back
to computational computer vision.

2
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:09,320
When we talk about
the color space of devices

3
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:13,250
actually when we talk about the color
space of devices, what we're usually

4
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:16,970
talking about is what's referred
to as the color gamut, okay?

5
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:21,840
And color gamuts are just
subsets of possible colors.

6
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,330
And here I'm showing you
three different color gamuts

7
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:29,960
that have been measured or that
are just defined in a particular way.

8
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:32,310
So you see this first one?

9
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:35,650
Alright, this is the 1931, that's that
Chromaticity Diagram I was telling you

10
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:39,450
about, and the, and this big
that's all the colors you can see.

11
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:45,640
Notice that on the inside,
is this triangle that is

12
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:51,930
a tremendous subset of that possible
set and you see it says HDTV.

13
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:55,700
Turns out these are all
the colors that HDTV can make.

14
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:59,300
So if you wanted to make this
really nice lush deep green,

15
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:03,600
HDTV can't do it because of the way
it defines its color space.

16
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,970
All right?

17
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:06,350
Any photographers out there?

18
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:07,960
I hope so.

19
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:11,810
If you use Photoshop or any other
photographic manipulations systems

20
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:16,510
that understand color spaces, they'll
tell you that you can have it in a color

21
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:22,110
space of sRGB or
Adobe RGB or ProPhoto RGB.

22
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:24,650
These are different sized color spaces,
and

23
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:28,205
you know one of them is
really small it's this sRGB.

24
00:01:28,205 --> 00:01:31,240
Okay, why do people use that one so
much?

25
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:36,260
That's the color space that most color
monitors used to be able to support.

26
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:37,160
Okay.
And so,

27
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,160
if you were displaying something,

28
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:42,580
say on the web,
you don't want to have these colors out

29
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:47,060
here because they're not going to
show up the right way on a monitor.

30
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:50,240
So when you try to do color balancing
sometimes you have to map colors that

31
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:55,380
are distributed out throughout all of
color space onto a smaller color space.

32
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:57,920
That's particularly true
when you print things.

33
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:03,600
Here is a, some gamut comparisons of so
again the, the big one

34
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:08,340
is all of human vision, the white one is
this Adobe RGB we were talking about.

35
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:09,669
Notice the green one.

36
00:02:09,669 --> 00:02:13,800
The green one it says
Epson 2200 Premium Luster.

37
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:19,850
That's the color gamut of one particular
printer on one particular paper, okay.

38
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:22,650
That's the set of colors
that that printer can make.

39
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:25,490
So if you have a color out
here it won't work very well.

40
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:26,760
Likewise down there.

41
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:30,590
I learned this the hard way when I
first got into digital photography.

42
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:35,250
My daughter at the time was about 11
years old was wearing this really kind

43
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:40,190
of dark blue shiny, royal blue dress and
I printed it on a HP printer,

44
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:44,070
not a great printer but not
a terrible printer and it was purple.

45
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:46,950
And what was annoying to me
to begin with is the color of

46
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:48,990
a bunch of other things were perfect.

47
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:51,580
So why, you know, because I understood
color balance, you know, maybe I had

48
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:55,650
a wrong color, no, you know, my,
my son's gray thing was nice and gray.

49
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:57,510
It didn't, it didn't shift blue or red.

50
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:00,700
But her pur,
her blue thing was looking purple.

51
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:05,010
The reason was is that is was outside
the color gamut of the printer.

52
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:06,460
All right?

53
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:09,140
And I've subsequently paid a lot of
money to get a much better printer
