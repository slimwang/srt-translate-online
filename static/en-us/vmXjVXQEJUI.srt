00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,150
There are benefits of multithreading both to applications when we

2
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:09,610
have multithreaded applications, but also to the operating system, itself.

3
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:12,900
By multithreading the operating system's kernel,

4
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:17,650
we allow the operating system to support multiple execution contexts.

5
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:20,010
And this is particularly useful when there are,

6
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:25,120
in fact, multiple CPUs, so that the operating system context can execute

7
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:30,270
concurrently on different CPUs in a multiprocessor or multicore platform.

8
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:36,050
The operating system's threads may run on behalf of certain applications.

9
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:39,480
Or, they may also run some operating system level services,

10
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:42,200
like certain daemons or device drivers.
