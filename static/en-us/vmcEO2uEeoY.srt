1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Again, that should not have been too hard. The answer is, of course, a bug in the compiler.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
We can check all of these possible causes by the changes they have.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
No me would have some effect--well, you wouldn't be able to listen to this course right now.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Richard Stallman--no Richard Stallman would have a huge impact.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
The GNU project is the source for so much great open source software out there.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
We would have a very different role. Oxygen is of more important.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I can't even start to begin to imagine how our world would look like, and of all these courses,

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:45,000
fixing a bug in the compiler has by far the smallest set of assumption and also the smallest effect

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
because apart from fixing the bug and apart from fixing the crash, nothing else changes

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
and therefore, this is the actual cause.
