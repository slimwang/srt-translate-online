1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:06,188
The final answer is 2 root 35 plus root 15, all divided by 5. Now if you got

2
00:00:06,188 --> 00:00:09,838
this one correct, that's amazing. You've really mastered rationalizing

3
00:00:09,838 --> 00:00:13,553
denominators. We start rationalizing this denominator by multiplying by the

4
00:00:13,553 --> 00:00:18,410
conjugate divided by the conjugate. Here our conjugate is 2 root 7 plus 2 root

5
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:23,524
3. We distribute 5 root 5 to each of these terms to get 10 root 35 plus 5 root

6
00:00:23,524 --> 00:00:28,282
15. For our denominator, we use the pattern of the difference of squares to do

7
00:00:28,282 --> 00:00:33,941
A squared minus B squared. Next, we simplify our denominator. 2 root 7 squared

8
00:00:33,941 --> 00:00:41,500
is 4 times 7, and root 3 squared is 3. Next, we multiply here to get 28. And we

9
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:45,796
really know 28 minus 3 equals 25. Now I notice that each of these terms has a

10
00:00:45,796 --> 00:00:50,607
common factor of 5. I can factor a 5 from each of these, to be left with 5

11
00:00:50,607 --> 00:00:56,355
times the quantity, 2 root 35 plus one root 15. And for our denominator of 25,

12
00:00:56,355 --> 00:01:01,352
I'll split it up to factors of 5 times 5. These reduce to 1, leaving us with 2

13
00:01:01,352 --> 00:01:07,130
root 35 plus root 15 in the numerator. And 1 times 5 or 5 in our denominator.

14
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:11,222
Great work if you found some of the steps or most of the steps to rationalize

15
00:01:11,222 --> 00:01:13,449
this denominator.
