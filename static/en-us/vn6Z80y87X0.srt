1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Let's take a look again at our example.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:08,000
We see that the condition in here not only handles double quotes but also single quotes.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Question is, is there a difference in how the condition handles double quotes and single quotes?

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
We still have this hypothesis characterizing the error.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Let's see whether it generalizes to arbitrary quotes, that is general quotes are stripped from the input,

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
whether they'd be double or single.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
In order to check this hypothesis, we now use an input foo in single quote

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
and we expect the output to have single quotes as well in the output as what's happening in here.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Here again we have our program.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
We now need to remove these assertions in order to restore it to its original state.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
And now, we're going to invoke this with foo and single quotes

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
and again, we need to enclose this with quotes to make this a Python string.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
General rule of thumb, if you have single quotes in a Python string,

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
we need to enclose it in double quotes.

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
If you have double quotes in a Python string, we need to enclose it in single quotes.

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And if you have both, we need to come up with an additional multiple strings

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
enclosed in single quotes and double quotes.

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
So, here we go, we put in foo and single quotes into the program and now let's see what happens.

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Surprise--what you see here, if you put in single quote, they are not stripped

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
whereas just to recheck, double quotes; however, are stripped from the input.

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
That's and important end. Double quotes are stripped and single quotes are not.

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
So the output actually contains single quote which means that our hypothesis as up here

23
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
as up here is rejected--the single quotes are not stripped.
