1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:03,882
We would need to make sure that each element of the domain is paired with

2
00:00:03,882 --> 00:00:08,392
exactly one element of the range of the function. One way to do this

3
00:00:08,392 --> 00:00:11,837
graphically would be to draw the curve, and then, to use the vertical line test

4
00:00:11,837 --> 00:00:17,865
to see how many places this curve touches any given vertical line. If it never

5
00:00:17,865 --> 00:00:23,500
touches any vertical line more than once, then it is a function. And it looks

6
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:28,740
like the answer in this case is, yes, this is a function.
