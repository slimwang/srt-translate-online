1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,780
The prevailing alternative and the one that is

2
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:05,980
used in most operational networks today is link state

3
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:09,590
routing. In link state routing, each node distributes

4
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:12,200
a network map to every other node in the

5
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:15,580
network. And then, each node performs a shortest

6
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:19,030
path computation between itself and all other nodes in

7
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:22,300
the network. So initially, each node adds the cost

8
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:26,000
of its immediate neighbors, D(v), and every other distance

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,189
to a node that is infinite. Then each node floods the cost between nodes u and v

10
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:35,100
to all of its neighbors. And the distance to

11
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:37,930
any node v becomes the minimum of the cost

12
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:43,990
between u and w plus the cost to w. Or the current shortest path to v. The

13
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:47,930
shortest path computation is often called the dijkstra, shortest

14
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:51,200
path ROUTING ALGORITHM. Two common link state routing protocol

15
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:54,390
are open shortest paths first or OSPF and

16
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:58,030
intermediate system - intermediate system or IS-IS. In

17
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:01,710
recent years, IS-IS has gained increasing use in

18
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:04,110
large internet service providers and is the more

19
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:07,950
commonly used. Link state routing protocol in large

20
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:10,880
transit networks today. One problem with link state

21
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,540
routing is scale. The complexity of a link

22
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:16,270
state routing protocol grows as n cubed where n

23
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:17,690
is the number of nodes in the network.
