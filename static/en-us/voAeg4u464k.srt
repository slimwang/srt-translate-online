00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:05,350
We do the same thing we've been doing. If we travel 0 miles, we plug 0 in for

00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:12,410
x. And the we get 160.13, which is our y intercept. It's kind of hard to see

00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:19,260
with this graph. Basically, this means you're paying an additional $160.13 for

4
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:24,660
every flight. No matter how far you're going, and then an additional 20 cents

00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:26,150
for every mile traveled.
