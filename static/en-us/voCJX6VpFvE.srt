00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:03,200
Using Google Sheets,
let's determine the formula for

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:05,910
a line with the x and
y-values that we have.

3
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:09,750
Where x is the number of employees, and
y is the average number of tickets.

4
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:13,470
First, to calculate the slope of a line

5
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:15,159
we use the slope function
in Google Sheets.

6
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,945
Note that all the functions
used in this lesson,

7
00:00:18,945 --> 00:00:20,917
are the same as in Microsoft Excel.

8
00:00:20,917 --> 00:00:25,321
The formula calculates
the slope of 0.1833.

9
00:00:25,321 --> 00:00:28,200
Therefore, for
every additional employee,

10
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,930
the average number of
tickets increases by 0.1833.

11
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:34,860
Next, let's calculate the y-intercept.

12
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:37,420
For this, we use the intercept function.

13
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:41,121
The y-intercept is -11.055.

14
00:00:41,121 --> 00:00:44,780
Now we know the equation of our line,

15
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:49,390
y equals 0.1833x minus 11.055.
