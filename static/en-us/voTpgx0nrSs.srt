00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,758
Now as Doctor Zelig says, the ABCs can be used intentionally to change

2
00:00:03,758 --> 00:00:08,725
behavior. But, we should also be aware that the ABCs occur in our natural

3
00:00:08,725 --> 00:00:13,656
environment. For example, let's say you're thirsty. This is a motivation, then

4
00:00:13,656 --> 00:00:17,562
you see the refrigerator, which is the cue, and you grab a soda and drink it,

5
00:00:17,562 --> 00:00:25,368
which is the behavior. Then your thirst is quenched. Annie had something tasty

6
00:00:25,368 --> 00:00:29,444
to drink, which is the consequence. Because the consequence was positive, this

7
00:00:29,444 --> 00:00:32,616
tells me that I'm more likely to go to the refrigerator and get a drink when

8
00:00:32,616 --> 00:00:37,876
I'm thirsty. However, there's another way you can look at this. Let's take the

9
00:00:37,876 --> 00:00:42,208
same scenario. First say you're thirsty, which is your motivation. You see the

10
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:45,688
refrigerator, which is your cue. So the behavior in this scenario is that you

11
00:00:45,688 --> 00:00:50,616
grab milk and drink it. But it was sour milk. So the consequence in this

12
00:00:50,616 --> 00:00:53,448
scenario is that you spit out the milk and it was really gross, it didn't

13
00:00:53,448 --> 00:00:58,144
quench your thirst. So this is a negative consequence. Therefore, you're

14
00:00:58,144 --> 00:01:00,696
going to be less likely to go back to the refrigerator and grab milk in the

15
00:01:00,696 --> 00:01:01,780
future.
