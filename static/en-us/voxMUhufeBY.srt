1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:03,035
So here you can see my onCreates and
in my onCreate,

2
00:00:03,035 --> 00:00:05,150
I've done most of these tasks.

3
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:09,352
So first of all my three buttons are my
mSignInButton, mSignOutButton, and

4
00:00:09,352 --> 00:00:10,790
mRevokeButton.

5
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:13,410
And these I just find them
using findViewById and

6
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:15,900
passing in the ordered id of the button.

7
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,570
These are objects that I've declared.

8
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:20,790
Two of them are button and
one of them is one of sign in buttons.

9
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:25,160
I'm also saying the TextView status,
I'm just, again, sign_in_status

10
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:29,650
is my TextView, and allocating this
to the local object called mStatus.

11
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:32,870
So then, for the three buttons, I set
an OnClickListener, and I just set it to

12
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:35,880
this, so then this class becomes
the callback for OnClickListener.

13
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,820
And then finally, I'm saying, for

14
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:42,960
my GoogleApiClient, I've defined
a local Google API client here.

15
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,740
If I scroll up,
you can see here where I've defined it.

16
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:48,680
It's a private GoogleApiClient and
GoogleApiClient.

17
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:51,020
I've done the same with the buttons and
the textView.

18
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:54,590
And so now here, I'm just assigning my
GoogleApiClient to the output of this

19
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:55,940
function, buildApiClient.

20
00:00:56,980 --> 00:01:00,590
I've created that function here, and
this just builds the API client.

21
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:03,890
It uses the Plus.API
as we had discussed.

22
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:07,807
And it just does the usual API Client
stuff, adding the ConnectionCallbacks,

23
00:01:07,807 --> 00:01:10,790
adding the OnConnectionFailedListener,
adding the API,

24
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:12,850
but also adding Scope as we've defined.

25
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:15,420
So we're going to use the PROFILE Scope
and we do it in this way.

26
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:18,170
Now we'll build that and then return it.

27
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:22,670
So now in my onCreate,
I'm going to get a Google API client And

28
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:24,650
it's going to be built
by this helper function.

29
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:28,730
And it's going to be one to use
the Plus.API and PROFILE scope.

30
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:29,960
Pretty straight forward, right?
