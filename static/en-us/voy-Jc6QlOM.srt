00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:01,732
Welcome to Intro to Psychology.

2
00:00:01,732 --> 00:00:02,694
I'm Lauren.

3
00:00:02,694 --> 00:00:03,586
I'm Susan.

4
00:00:03,586 --> 00:00:04,740
And I'm Greg.

5
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:06,410
We're your instructors for this course.

6
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:08,650
We're going to take you
on your journey through psychology.

7
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:12,620
We'll go over different areas of psychology
and how different psychologists examine

8
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:14,580
and explain thought and behavior.

9
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:17,380
We are all very different.
We like different things.

10
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:20,870
We think differently.
We even react differently.

11
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:25,730
So for instance, I have something here

12
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:28,762
that might create
different reactions in people.

13
00:00:28,772 --> 00:00:30,750
Ooh. Look at this guy.

14
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:35,990
My snake Tickles. I've come to really
enjoy him. He's a nice snake.

15
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:38,010
I wouldn't mind holding Tickles

16
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:41,501
or touching him but I certainly
wouldn't want him as a pet.

17
00:00:41,501 --> 00:00:42,707
Lauren?

18
00:00:42,707 --> 00:00:44,235
No, no, I don't do snakes.

19
00:00:44,235 --> 00:00:45,385
You don't do snakes.

20
00:00:45,385 --> 00:00:46,495
No. I don't do snakes.

21
00:00:46,495 --> 00:00:50,375
The perfect example of how people
react differently to different situations.

22
00:00:50,375 --> 00:00:53,620
So, there's many different areas
of psychology, for instance,

23
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:56,840
personality psychologists would look 
at what's going on here

24
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:00,620
and try to really understand
the individual differences in the fear

25
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:05,935
and why I'm not really afraid, you're
fine and she's more or less terrified.

26
00:01:05,935 --> 00:01:10,260
behavioral Psychologists might look
at an individual's learning history.

27
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:13,900
So, for example I was exposed to a lot
of snakes when I was growing up.

28
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:17,760
So, perhaps I've learned that snakes
aren't dangerous for me.

29
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:21,250
And a Social Psychologist may look
at how other people's behavior

30
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:25,040
influences our own. So, for example,
looking at other people's reactions

31
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,010
may influence our own reactions.

32
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:30,650
A biological psychologist, perhaps,
may look at Lauren's fright response

33
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:35,710
in terms of increase in heart rate,
or even sweating. And a neuroscientist.

34
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:38,980
They may look at the areas of the brain
that are activated during the fear response,

35
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:40,510
such as the amygdala.

36
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:44,610
But for now, I think it's time
for Tickles to head home.

37
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:48,490
Even though this example exploited
my fear of snakes. Thanks a lot Greg.

38
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:50,240
It was a really effective tool for Susan

39
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,750
and Greg to use to show you just
how diverse psychology can be.

40
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:56,860
Now psychology is defined as a study
of thought and behavior

41
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:59,440
and is an amazing way
to make sense of our world
