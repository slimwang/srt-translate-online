1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:01,880
Okay Michael, I didn't give you as much time as I normally

2
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:05,660
do because you think you already know the answer. So what's the answer?

3
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:07,160
>> So, you know, I'd rather get the

4
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:09,180
plus 2's occasionally, so I'll say the bottom one.

5
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:09,760
>> No.

6
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:13,600
>> Wait, what? You're not going to tell me the top one's better?

7
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:14,300
>> no, it's not.

8
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:17,690
>> Okay then that feels like a trick question.

9
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:19,340
>> It's not a trick question. The answer

10
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:21,130
is, neither one is better than the other.

11
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:23,100
>> Oh, so I had to give neither?

12
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:23,840
>> Or both.

13
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,320
>> Which is better, and I can click

14
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:25,660
on neither.

15
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:28,350
>> Or you could click on both. Okay. So you thought

16
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:30,970
that the bottom one was better, what was your reasoning for that?

17
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:33,660
>> Because, sort of moment to moment, sometimes

18
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:35,305
I'm getting plus one's, and that matches what I

19
00:00:35,305 --> 00:00:37,420
would've gotten if I had been on the other

20
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:39,540
bank. But then sometimes I get plus two's, which

21
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,040
is actually better than what I would have gotten

22
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,470
on the other bank. And so, I'm, I'm, I

23
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:46,740
never feel any regret being on the bottom bank.

24
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:48,360
I only feel regret being on the top bank.

25
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,320
>> That's fine. So, what would you say

26
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,040
the utility of the sequence along the bottom actually is?

27
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:58,440
>> 1 plus 1 plus 2 plus 1 plus 1 plus 2 plus dot, dot, dot.

28
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:59,580
>> Which is equal to?

29
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:01,760
>> infinity, I guess.

30
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,709
>> That's right. What about the utility of the top one?

31
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:06,750
>> 1 plus 1 plus 1 plus, that's also infinity.

32
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:09,130
>> Yep. So the utility of both of those sequences is equal

33
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:12,360
to infinity. Do you think one of them is bigger than the other?

34
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,340
>> You drew the bottom one a larg, a little bit larger.

35
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:15,710
>> I did.

36
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:16,480
Or longer, anyway.

37
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,010
>> Yeah.

38
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:20,390
>> But, in the end, the sum of the rewards that you get are both

39
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:23,760
going to be infinity. So the truth is, neither

40
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,550
one of them is better than the other.

41
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:27,430
>> I still don't think you can say that both are better.

42
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:28,430
>> You can't get around that.

43
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:31,570
>> But yeah, I see, I see, neither, I can see neither is better.

44
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:35,110
>> Or that both are better. Neither is better, both is

45
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:39,300
better, whatever. The point is that, they're both equal to infinity.

46
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:39,720
>> Hm.

47
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:40,760
>> And the reason they're

48
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:44,520
equal to infinity is because all we're doing is accumulating

49
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:48,240
rewards. And, if we're always going to be able to get positive

50
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,110
rewards no matter what we do, then it doesn't matter

51
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:55,540
what we do. This is the existential dilemma of being immortal.

52
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:57,390
>> Oh, living forever.

53
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:57,480
>> Right.

54
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:02,250
>> So if you live forever then, like why should you care about anything ever?

55
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:07,000
>> Right I mean, everyone, every all the mortal people are going to die and

56
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,729
one day they'll all be, you know, an infinite

57
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:11,850
amount of time in your past. I could do

58
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:14,180
this thing here, which is pleasurable, or I could

59
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:17,280
do this thing right now, that, you know, will, is

60
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,980
less pleasurable, but will eventually get me to a

61
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:22,090
better place. But if I'm going to live forever, and I

62
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:23,900
can always get to a better place, than it

63
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:26,640
really doesn't matter what I do. It really doesn't matter.

64
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,190
>> Mm.

65
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:29,830
>> Because I'm just accumulating rewards,

66
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:31,670
I'm living forever, and I'm going to,

67
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:34,230
infinity is infinity and there's no really no way to compare them.

68
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:37,850
Having said that, your original notion that, look, it feels like I

69
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:41,250
should never regret having taken the second path compared to the first

70
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:45,750
because I will occasionally do better. Seems like the right intuition to have.

71
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:49,240
>> I see but it's just not built into this particular utility scheme.

72
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:52,910
>> Right, but it turns out there's a very easy way we can build

73
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:56,720
it into this utility scheme by just making one tiny little change. Would you

74
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,250
like to see it?

75
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:57,710
>> Yes.

76
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:58,920
>> Beautiful, let's see it then
