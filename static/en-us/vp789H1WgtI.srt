1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:01,230
First things first,

2
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:04,470
we need to target the element that
we're going to listen to for events.

3
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:05,010
So that's B.

4
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:08,300
Position two is the on method.

5
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:10,010
So that's C.

6
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:13,350
Position three is the type of
event that we want to listen for.

7
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:13,970
So that's D.

8
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:19,830
And the last one is A, the callback
function that will be run when the event

9
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:21,290
happens on the target element.
