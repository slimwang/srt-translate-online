1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,844
The advantage to this technique is that many people can rate their own

2
00:00:03,844 --> 00:00:08,436
personalities relatively quickly. Also, because the answers are limited to

3
00:00:08,436 --> 00:00:13,805
usually around five categories. Such as strongly disagree, disagree, neither

4
00:00:13,805 --> 00:00:19,624
agree nor disagree, agree, and strongly agree. They can be scored and summed

5
00:00:19,624 --> 00:00:24,640
easily. They're objectively scored, not subjectively, like projective tests

6
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:30,198
are. Now the problem, as always, is the questions and the answers must be

7
00:00:30,198 --> 00:00:35,695
reliable and valid. If people answer questions one way at one point in time

8
00:00:35,695 --> 00:00:39,223
,but differently, say, a month later, then we don't have a reliable

9
00:00:39,223 --> 00:00:45,237
questionnaire. In addition, sometimes people may give biased answers. And

10
00:00:45,237 --> 00:00:49,722
finally, if a person doesn't really read the question or, take them seriously

11
00:00:49,722 --> 00:00:54,138
and just puts random answers in, they're not valid reflections of a person's

12
00:00:54,138 --> 00:01:00,498
personality. So good personality questionnaires take years of research to

13
00:01:00,498 --> 00:01:06,000
establish the reliability and validity. And have ways of detecting random or

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,080
inconsistent answers.
