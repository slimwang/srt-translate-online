1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,880
So lets consider the example of this program here where we do an R and

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:07,020
then we should branch to the label but instead we mispredicted and

3
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:10,100
go to a divide, and we really should have executed this multiply.

4
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:14,340
As far as the processor is concerned, it could look like we first did this,

5
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:17,470
then we did this, then we finally did this,

6
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:23,510
resolve the branch, undone this, done this. So at some given point in time.

7
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:28,990
The processor sees maybe this as fully executed, but not committed,

8
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:33,180
at that same point in time, only this instruction is percepts committed. So

9
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:36,820
the Programmer sees just this as done. If the program finishes this,

10
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:40,200
until the processor finishes this here. The Programmer is not going to say

11
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:43,830
that is executed. So the Programmer never really sees, for example, this divide.

12
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:48,370
Because by the time the Programmer sees something after the branch execute,

13
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:52,810
the branch completes execution. And at that point we kill the divide.

14
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:57,230
We remove it from the row so the Programmer will finally see the branch execute.

15
00:00:57,230 --> 00:01:01,500
But after that. The processor will start fetching from here so the next thing

16
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:05,129
the Programmer sees is this. So the Programmer never really sees execution of,

17
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:09,920
of any wrong path instructions. And on exceptions, the Programmer never sees any

18
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,570
instructions other than those that should have been executed. So

19
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:17,200
basically,. This commit is really kind of the officially executed.

20
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,870
Whereas the actual execution before we broadcast the result, is simply kind of

21
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:24,170
the internal state of the processor that is maybe not reflected to

22
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:28,180
the outside world, until we are sure that everything is fine with the result
