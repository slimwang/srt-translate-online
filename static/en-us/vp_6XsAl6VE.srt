00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:04,780
For a consistent one hut encoding,
we need to pick ones such that

2
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:08,760
each class gets a unique
position on the vector.

3
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:09,990
Here's what I picked.

4
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:13,160
Given this encoding the most
likely classes is C.
