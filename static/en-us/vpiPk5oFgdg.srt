1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:07,329
Our transpose code is reading 1024 by 1024 elements.

2
00:00:07,329 --> 00:00:11,953
Each element has 4 bytes, and we are both reading and writing them,

3
00:00:11,953 --> 00:00:16,254
so we're going to have to transfer those values across the bus twice.

4
00:00:16,254 --> 00:00:18,433
That's the total amount of memory.

5
00:00:18,433 --> 00:00:21,124
It's taking 0.67 milliseconds,

6
00:00:21,124 --> 00:00:25,895
which is about 1.25 times 10 to the 10 bytes per second,

7
00:00:25,895 --> 00:00:30,633
or scaled to gigabytes, about 12.5 gigabytes per second.

8
00:00:30,633 --> 00:00:34,177
So we're not really coming that close to the theoretical peak bandwidth.

9
00:00:34,177 --> 00:00:36,200
We can probably do better.
