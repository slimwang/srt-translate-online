1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:01,700
This is what I put in.

2
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:05,680
I needed a max-width media query that
would set the background-color to

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:09,520
red when the screen was no
larger than 400 pixels.

4
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:13,600
Then, I needed another media query that
set the background-color to blue when

5
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:16,340
the screen was no
smaller than 600 pixels.

6
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:19,780
And then finally, I needed to set
the background-color to green for

7
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:22,380
screens between these two break points.

8
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:25,910
I went ahead and did it by setting the
background-color to green before these

9
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:27,040
two media queries.

10
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:30,175
This way, the CSS cascade kicks in,

11
00:00:30,175 --> 00:00:35,485
and it's only applied, this color here,
when these two break points are not.

12
00:00:35,485 --> 00:00:38,985
Of course, I easily could have put
background-color green into a media

13
00:00:38,985 --> 00:00:41,825
query, but well, I didn't need to.

14
00:00:41,825 --> 00:00:47,575
And there it is, blue, green, and red.

15
00:00:47,575 --> 00:00:48,445
That wasn't too difficult.
