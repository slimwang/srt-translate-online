00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,497
Let's do one more example of where we would use a confidence interval before we

2
00:00:04,497 --> 00:00:09,240
move on. Well, hopefully you're enjoying the class so far. How would we measure

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:13,576
this? Maybe one way is to look at the number of minutes that each person has

4
00:00:13,576 --> 00:00:18,593
watched of the videos. Divided by the total minutes that are available we could

5
00:00:18,593 --> 00:00:22,871
call this something like the engagement ratio because this provides some

6
00:00:22,871 --> 00:00:27,825
indication of how engaged you are. If you're watching more video then you are

7
00:00:27,825 --> 00:00:32,973
probably more engaged. As of March 11th, when I'm recording this, there are

8
00:00:32,973 --> 00:00:39,188
8,702 students enrolled in the course. I made up this hypothetical data set the

9
00:00:39,188 --> 00:00:44,204
link is below, unfortunately I couldn't get the actual data for every student,

10
00:00:44,204 --> 00:00:48,830
but I think the shape is pretty close to what it really is. And that's just the

11
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:52,806
nature of the MOOC. A lot of people sign up because it's free and easy, but they

12
00:00:52,806 --> 00:00:56,712
don't progress through the course or they just sign up with the intention of

13
00:00:56,712 --> 00:01:01,965
doing it later. However if you're taking the course for credit, which I think

14
00:01:01,965 --> 00:01:06,255
about a hundred of you are, you're probably up here on the distribution, making

15
00:01:06,255 --> 00:01:10,800
your way through the course to get credit for it. So first of all, calculate the

16
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:15,281
mean and standard deviation for this data. This is a pretty big data set, so try

17
00:01:15,281 --> 00:01:19,955
to make use of the keyboard shortcuts that you've learned before. Treat this as

18
00:01:19,955 --> 00:01:25,353
a population and round to the nearest thousandths or three decimal places.
