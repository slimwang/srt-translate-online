1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Let's go through it together.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:08,000
1 plus blank equals 2, this is pretty much just 1. 1 plus 1 equals 2.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Just like in Python, JavaScript supports string concatenation using addition.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I didn't tell you about this explicitly, but I did tell you to use your Python intuition.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
We're going to fill in this blank with one as well,

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
but this one is a string O-N-E.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
The string P-H plus the string O-N-E will equal the string P-H-O-N-E.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Over here this is perhaps the trickiest on the screen.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
In order for this whole expression to be True,

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
both of these sub-expressions,

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
both of these conjuncts if you prefer mathematics have to be true.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
X must be equal to 8 and this complicated math over here must also be true.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Well, if x is equal to 8 then x divided by 2 is 4.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
X divided by 2 equals 4 should return True.

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
This'll be true on the left and true on the right.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Finally, over here, what's anything that we could put in this blank that would

17
00:01:03,000 --> 99:59:59,999
possibly make this expression turn true? J\ust write out the Boolean constant True.
