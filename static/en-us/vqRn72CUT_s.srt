1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:01,323
Let's add the code now to our app.

2
00:00:01,323 --> 00:00:05,710
We're going to start by calculating
the base price of a drink.

3
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:07,910
The base price is composed of two parts.

4
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:11,310
The price of the coffee,
which is $5 plus any toppings.

5
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:13,420
So $1 for whip cream,
or $2 for chocolate.

6
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:15,523
We're going to take this base price, and

7
00:00:15,523 --> 00:00:19,360
then we're going to multiply it
by the quantity of cups ordered.

8
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:21,080
That will brings us to
the total order price.

9
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,930
Let's calculate the price for
a sample order,

10
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:28,770
where the user wants 3 cups of coffee
with whipped cream, like this.

11
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:32,409
The goal of this course is not to test
your math skills so let's walk through

12
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:35,210
the calculation together to make
sure that you understand it.

13
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:38,860
The real goal will be for
you to translate this logic into code.

14
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:42,910
In this sample order the user wants
3 cups of coffee with whipped cream,

15
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:44,000
like this.

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,070
First, we can start off by calculating
the base price of 1 cup of coffee.

17
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:53,180
We start with $5 for the coffee cup
plus $1 for the whipped cream topping.

18
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:55,390
That brings us to $6 per cup.

19
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:57,580
Then, we need to find
the total order price.

20
00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:02,878
Since the user ordered 3 cups of coffee,
we multiply $6 per cup times 3 cups.

21
00:01:02,878 --> 00:01:07,010
That equals $18 total for
the whole order.

22
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:09,650
In this sample order,
we have 2 cups of coffee and

23
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:14,840
each cup has whipped cream topping and
chocolate topping, like this and this.

24
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,860
First, we calculate
the base price of 1 cup.

25
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:21,090
A cup of coffee costs $5,
and then we add $1 for

26
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:23,620
whipped cream and $2 for chocolate.

27
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:28,540
That brings us to a total of 5,
6, 7, 8, $8 per cup.

28
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:32,830
Then we find the total order price since
the user ordered 2 cups of coffee.

29
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:37,140
We take the base price of $8 per
cup of coffee times 2 cups and

30
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:40,200
that brings us to $16 total for
the whole order.

31
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:42,580
This is what our app should look like.

32
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,772
We can enter in a name,

33
00:01:44,772 --> 00:01:49,010
choose a whipped cream topping and
then change the quantity to 3.

34
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:52,840
If we hit the Order button,
we expect the price to change to $18.

35
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,180
And there it is.

36
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:58,450
This is exactly what we
calculated earlier by hand.

37
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:01,680
If I add the chocolate topping,
change the quantity to 2.

38
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,030
Then the total price becomes $16,

39
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:08,740
also just like we calculated where
we have $8 per cup of coffee.

40
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:12,050
Now, go ahead and plan out the steps
that you need to do in order to add this

41
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:13,590
functionality to our app.

42
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:16,300
I wrote down the price of
the toppings here for reference.

43
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:18,910
And here's a screen shot of
what the app should look like

44
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:20,800
with the adjusted price here.

45
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,910
After you've planned out the steps then
go ahead and implement this in your app.

46
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:27,560
Then, can you tell me what
method did you end up modifying?
