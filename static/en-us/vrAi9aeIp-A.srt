1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So we're going to have another quiz about "while" loops.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
This one's going to be a little trickier.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
The same idea, your goal is to guess what this program will do

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and, like the last one, try to figure out the answer yourself

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
rather than by running the code.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
We're going to assign 1 to the variable "i".

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
We'll have a "while" loop where the test condition is: "i" is not equal to 10.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
And, in the Block, we'll have a statement that says:

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
"i" is assigned the value of "i" plus 2--

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
so adding 2 to "i", then we'll print "i".

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
So the choices are: produce an error,

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
print out the numbers: 2, 4, 6, 8;

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
print out: 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9;

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
print out: 3, 5, 7, and 9--or run forever.
