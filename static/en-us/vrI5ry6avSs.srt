00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,886
Here are the answers, and great thinking if you got all three correct. For the

2
00:00:03,886 --> 00:00:06,692
first one, we want to multiply by the square root of 2 divided by the square

3
00:00:06,692 --> 00:00:10,770
root of 2. We really multiply by a form of 1 so that way we can change our

4
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:15,618
denominator to the square root of 2 squared. This allows us to take the square

5
00:00:15,618 --> 00:00:19,416
root, so we get 2 in our denominator. And this is what we mean when we

6
00:00:19,416 --> 00:00:24,361
rationalize a denominator. We multiply our fraction by a form of 1, so that way

7
00:00:24,361 --> 00:00:28,935
our radical does not appear here. For the second one, we want to get rid of the

8
00:00:28,935 --> 00:00:32,859
square root of y in this denominator. So we multiply the numerator and

9
00:00:32,859 --> 00:00:37,120
denominator by the square root of y. This gives us the root of xy here, and the

10
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:42,680
root of y squared here. Our factor of y appears twice inside of our square

11
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:47,134
root, so the root undoes our power and we're left with y. Notice, another

12
00:00:47,134 --> 00:00:53,280
fraction with no radical in the denominator. That's rationalizing. And finally,

13
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,430
for this last one, we just want to multiply the numerator and denominator by

14
00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:01,540
the square root of 2xy. Now you might be wondering, how did I get this. Well

15
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:05,180
there's an intermediate simplification step. In the numerator, we'll have 4

16
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:09,416
times the root of 2xy. In our denominator, we know if we multiply the same

17
00:01:09,416 --> 00:01:14,435
square roots together, we'll just get the radicand, which is just 2xy. Now we

18
00:01:14,435 --> 00:01:19,883
simply 4 divided by 2 to get 2 divided by 1. Here's our final result.
