00:00:00,004 --> 00:00:04,083
Let's try another rational function. We'll look for both the horizontal and the

2
00:00:04,083 --> 00:00:09,186
vertical asymptotes. But let's just start out with the vertical. The function

3
00:00:09,186 --> 00:00:13,518
I'd like us to look at is f of x equals 8x squared minus 1 over 4x squared

4
00:00:13,518 --> 00:00:18,635
minus 9. Please write the vertical asymptotes in this box, separating the

5
00:00:18,635 --> 00:00:20,290
equations by commas.
