1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:01,950
At this point,

2
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:05,150
we could perhaps make updates to our model that increase its accuracy.

3
00:00:06,805 --> 00:00:09,670
Its accuracy is quite high at this point.

4
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:12,660
And it would probably be more fruitful to consider new questions all

5
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:14,480
together that our analysis has opened up.

6
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:21,700
For example, how well is this model generalized to other users of Twitter?

7
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:25,820
Can we classify Twitter users into different classes distinguished by

8
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:28,910
which type of model characterizes their tweeting habits.

9
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:33,920
We've made a model that predicts time to next tweet overall, but

10
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,820
can we now build a predictor for time to tweet about a specific subject.

11
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:40,200
As you can see,

12
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:44,060
our analysis is opened up the room to many possible new investigations.
