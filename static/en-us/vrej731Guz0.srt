[Norvig] Here's a quiz question.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I want you to tell me which of these possible representations for a hand

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
do you think make sense.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Somewhat this is subjective.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
You may have different opinions.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
So tell me all the ones that you think are pretty good

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
and not the ones that you think are problematic.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
So it could be a list of 2 character strings,

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
a list of tuples of numbers and strings,

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
a set that was similar to the list,

11
00:00:30,000 --> 99:59:59,999
or just a single big string.
