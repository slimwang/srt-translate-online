00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Welcome back to statistics.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Today we do a case study in regression.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
In this case study, I will use again the data that you all submitted

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
about my current weight called L and my previous weight from last year

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
as you guessed it all in kilograms called P.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Here is my question for you as a well-trained statistician.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
What is the very first thing I'll do?

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Compute the mean, the variance, and similar simple statistics?

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Run a scatterplot?

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Or go straight to the end and run my regression methods

11
00:00:35,000 --> 99:59:59,999
to see what's the best line that fits the data? Pick one.
