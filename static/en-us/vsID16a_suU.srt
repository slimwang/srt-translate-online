00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,996
>> The mean is $52,793.80. And if you remember, we did that by adding each of

2
00:00:05,996 --> 00:00:12,303
these up. And since there are 10 values, we divide the sum by 10. To remind you

3
00:00:12,303 --> 00:00:18,317
of the way we put this in symbols, we summed the first through the tenth, and

4
00:00:18,317 --> 00:00:23,499
then we divided by the number of values, and then we get the mean.
