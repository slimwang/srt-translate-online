1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,060
Here we can prune this node right here.

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:09,099
If we only knew the 11, this max
level here would be 11 or greater.

3
00:00:09,099 --> 00:00:11,869
However, even if the left
value was greater than 11,

4
00:00:11,869 --> 00:00:15,799
the next node up would still take
the 5 since it's a min level.

5
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:18,280
That means that we actually
don't need to check the 4 node

6
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:21,550
because it's irrelevant and
thus we can prune it from the tree.

7
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:24,289
We can't prune any other nodes or
branches in this situation.
