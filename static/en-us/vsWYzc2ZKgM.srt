1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,383
This one works in this case, but you could imagine cases where it wouldn't

2
00:00:03,383 --> 00:00:07,124
work. For example, what if the wall was very thin and actually is just right in

3
00:00:07,124 --> 00:00:11,484
here, then this wouldn't work anymore. Now however, the swept area does work no

4
00:00:11,484 --> 00:00:15,982
matter how fast the rocket is moving. The swept area will still collide with

5
00:00:15,982 --> 00:00:19,520
anything that is in the rocket's path between the two time steps, which is

6
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,480
really what we're looking for.
