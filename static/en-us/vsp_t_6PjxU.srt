1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:05,300
We had this problem, of when we put in through a correlation,

2
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:08,960
we got back out sort of this flip thing, all right.

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,560
And, if you remember,

4
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:15,860
here's the equation of correlation, we have this kernel H and we sum over it,

5
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:20,430
going from minus k to plus k, multiplying it times our image, and

6
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:25,010
what that did was it caused us to end up with that flipped result, all right.

7
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:29,010
The right way of thinking about this, is that, when an impulse comes in and

8
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:34,270
it hits the filter, what comes back out is sort of this, this reverse signal.

9
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:37,360
So, the, the right way of thinking about the operator is there's

10
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:42,270
something called convolution, and when we do convolution, that's what we

11
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:46,300
actually mean when we say we're going to apply this filter or this kernel, and

12
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:52,019
what convolution does, is it, flips both the left-right and

13
00:00:52,019 --> 00:00:55,120
the up-down direction, you could have either flipped the kernel or

14
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,750
flipped the axis to the pixels, it doesn't matter, you would get the, the same

15
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:04,860
value, and, so that flipping gives you what's referred to as convolution.

16
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:07,940
So by the way, if I was using a Gaussian or

17
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:13,940
a box filter, how will the outputs be different for correlation and convolution,

18
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:19,510
that is what happens if I flip my Gaussian, answer, nothing, okay?

19
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:24,050
For a circularly symmetric or for a symmetric filter, whether I do convolution

20
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:28,750
or correlation doesn't matter, it is going to matter to us in the next lecture,

21
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:31,250
the one after that when we take derivatives in one direction or

22
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:33,280
the other, and that's when you have to be careful, but

23
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,070
if you have a symmetric filter, it doesn't matter.

24
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:39,820
So this can be illustrated nicely in the following way, so

25
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:41,600
here we have the, equation for

26
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,580
the convolution operator, and we're going to illustrate it like this, all right.

27
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:49,560
So here we have our filter and there's this little asterisk up here and

28
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:53,180
the asterisk is to show you sort of what the top right hand corner is.

29
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:56,780
When we do correlation, we just pick that up and then we sort of slide it

30
00:01:56,780 --> 00:02:01,750
around, when we do convolution, what we do is we rotate, the thing, and,

31
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:04,470
because it essentially flips it left, right and up, down, right, you

32
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:08,820
see that the little asterisk is now down here in the bottom left hand corner.

33
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:10,620
Okay? And then, thank you, Kristin.

34
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:14,570
We zoom that all over the image and that gives you your output.

35
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:17,030
So, that's our convolution operator.

36
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:20,080
Again, the difference between correlation and convolution only matters if

37
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,070
you have an asymmetric filter but now you know the difference.

38
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:26,340
Like I say, convolution is actually sort of the physics, so

39
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:28,660
what's going on when you put an impulse through this response.
