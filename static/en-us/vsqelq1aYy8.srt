00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,323
>> Let's visualize what we did here. We have a bunch of data values and we found

2
00:00:05,323 --> 00:00:10,954
the mean, let's say it's here. Then we found the distance between each value and

3
00:00:10,954 --> 00:00:16,311
the mean and then squared them. This is essentially the area of every square

4
00:00:16,311 --> 00:00:21,938
whose side length is the distance between each value and the mean. So we all of

5
00:00:21,938 --> 00:00:28,386
these squares and the sum of squares is basically the sum of the area of each

6
00:00:28,386 --> 00:00:34,834
square where each distance is Xi minus X-bar and each area is Xi minus X-bar

7
00:00:34,834 --> 00:00:41,534
squared. So then we find the average square. So the average square might be

8
00:00:41,534 --> 00:00:47,925
something like this size, let's say. In this case, the dimensions are in

9
00:00:47,925 --> 00:00:54,770
dollars. So the area of this square would have units of dollars squared. So, how

10
00:00:54,770 --> 00:01:01,319
do we convert this back to just dollars? Take the square root, divide by 2, or

11
00:01:01,319 --> 00:01:03,636
subtract one dollar sign?
