00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:03,990
Here is a view of Xcode
showing our PitchPerfect apt.

2
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:06,180
I'm going to go over some of
the basic parts of Xcode.

3
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:08,580
And we'll be diving into
the coat in just a moment.

4
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:10,970
On the left side,

5
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:14,830
you can see the navigator panels
starting with the Project Navigator.

6
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:18,260
On the middle is the content area, and
it's currently showing the settings for

7
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:19,320
a pitch perfect project.

8
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,020
On the right side,
you have the utility area,

9
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:27,490
with the inspector panels with a file
inspector panel currently open.

10
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:30,450
On the bottom, you can see the debug and
console windows.

11
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:35,350
Unlike other IDEs and
editors you may have used in the past,

12
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:39,570
Xcode requires only a single click
to select a file or an item.

13
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:44,010
Starting with a navigator panel on the
left, there are many different ways to

14
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:46,760
view the files and
other parts of your project.

15
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:50,850
There are even ways to move through
these panels with just a keyboard.

16
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:51,890
As an example,

17
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:56,480
you can use command zero to toggle
the navigator's panel on and off.

18
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,200
If like me, you need to find more
screen space from time to time.

19
00:01:03,796 --> 00:01:06,421
On the right side we have
the inspectors panel and

20
00:01:06,421 --> 00:01:11,010
the number available depends on
the content or items you have selected.

21
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:15,640
In the case of this project setting we
can see file in quick help inspectors.

22
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:19,180
As you progress with your app you'll
be able to see other inspectors.

23
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:23,020
Much like the navigator panels you can
toggle the inspector panels by using

24
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:25,690
keyboard shortcuts to move through them.

25
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:29,620
This is especially useful if you're in
need of more space to view your content.

26
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:35,000
At Udacity we have a saying
that content is king.

27
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,070
And with Xcode that is also true.

28
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:40,930
The code and even your user interface in
storyboards are always in the center of

29
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:44,080
view here and
the prime spot in the content editor.

30
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,260
On the bottom right we
have the library and

31
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:50,800
at the very bottom of the screen you
can see the debug and console panels.

32
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:54,220
The console panel is where you
see the Hello World printed.

33
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:58,280
The Exco content editor is where you
going to spend a lot of your time

34
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,900
as an iOS developer.

35
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:01,260
It can.
Adapt to help you

36
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:03,040
edit any part of your project.

37
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:07,270
From project settings, to code,
to user interface elements.

38
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:10,979
Knowing that the editor is
contact sensitive can help a lot

39
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:14,390
when you're looking for how to change
a particular setting in Xcode.

40
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:19,560
With a Pitch Perfect project, which
is a little blue icon here on the top

41
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:23,640
of the project navigator we can see
the settings for the entire project.

42
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:26,480
We can see the version
that iOS is targeting, and

43
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,710
we can see that the interface file
is called Main for Main story board.

44
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,070
We can also use this decide what
orientation to support, and

45
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:36,130
to launch it.

46
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:38,940
Here you can see we're supporting
the portrait orientation,

47
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:41,360
as well as Landscape Left and
Landscape Right.

48
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:47,730
If we select the AppDelegate Swift file,
we can

49
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:52,900
see that the Xcode editor panel changes
to let us modify the Swift source code.

50
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:55,650
You can see that Xcode
automatically highlights the code

51
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:56,830
to make it easier to read.

52
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:01,750
Remember that main storyboard selection
back in the project settings?

53
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:04,544
That's referring to this file,
main.storyboard.

54
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:08,900
If you select it in a project
navigator with a single click.

55
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:15,780
The X Code editor changes to show you
the user interface for this application.

56
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:19,730
You can use two finger pinch to zoom out
of it so you can see the entire thing.

57
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:23,700
This is the view we're
going to use to set up.

58
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:28,390
Any UI elements for our IOS apps,
including pitch perfect.

59
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:31,950
I know it may seem like a lot but
we'll walk you through step by step and

60
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:35,230
touch every part of Xcode by the time
you've completed this course.
