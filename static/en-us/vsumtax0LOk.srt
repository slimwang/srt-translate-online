1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,550
The answer is only the first
sequence is bitonic.

2
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:08,250
Remember that the definition asks
us to check all circular shifts.

3
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:12,920
So, let's imagine the values of
the first sequence arranged in a ring.

4
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:17,880
Next, let's check whether
consecutive values go up or go down.

5
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:25,090
Going clockwise, 2 to 3,
3 to 6, and 0 to 2 all increase.

6
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:29,920
By contrast, 6 to 1 and
1 to 0 both decrease.

7
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:33,630
With respect to the ring,
all the pluses are consecutive and

8
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:35,750
all the minuses are consecutive.

9
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:39,130
So the sequence is bitonic
up to a circular shift.

10
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:40,130
Makes sense?

11
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:42,620
Let's try the same thing
with the second sequence.

12
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:44,050
First, we draw a ring.

13
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:46,750
Then we take differences going,
say, clockwise.

14
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:50,840
Phooey, the pluses and minuses are no
longer consecutive along the ring.

15
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:54,630
Therefore, there is no circular shift
that will satisfy the first condition.
