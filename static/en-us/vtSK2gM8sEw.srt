00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,690
Firewall is a widely deployed
prevention technology.

2
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:04,770
To motivate the need for

3
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:08,780
firewalls, let's look at a typical
enterprise network at a high level.

4
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:11,700
An enterprise network is
part of the Internet.

5
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:14,040
It typically has an internal or

6
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:19,160
trusted part, where only the company's
employees can access to.

7
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:23,470
For example, if this is a bank, the
trusted part of the enterprise network

8
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:25,320
has the internal email servers and

9
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:28,300
systems that process
financial transactions.

10
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:32,119
And only the authorized staff
can access such systems.

11
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:35,380
The enterprise network can also
have a public face, in part.

12
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:39,580
For example, the bank has a web server
for its customers to log in, or for

13
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:42,330
the public to just learn about the bank.

14
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:46,730
This public facing service or
in the so-called demilitarized zone or

15
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:50,320
DMZ, that while it is part
of the enterprise network,

16
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,960
it is separated from
the trusted network.

17
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:53,710
For example,

18
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:57,990
while customers can interact with
the web service in the DMZ to log in and

19
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:02,400
submit transaction requests, they
cannot directly access the servers in

20
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:06,760
the trusted network that are authorizing
and processing the transactions.

21
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:10,550
When a company has multiple physical
sites, for example a bank can have

22
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:15,280
different branches in several cities,
then each site can have its own local

23
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,070
and trusted network, but the sites
need to communicate with each other.

24
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:23,710
For example, employees in one city or
one branch, these are the trusted users,

25
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:27,740
need to access the corporate network
at the headquarters in another city.

26
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:28,860
And such access or

27
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:33,260
traffic is from across the Internet,
which is not trusted.

28
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:37,440
How do we get traffic to its destination
correctly across the Internet?

29
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,950
We need routers.

30
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:43,270
Each local or enterprise network has
at least one router at its perimeter.

31
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:46,410
And there are core routers
on the Internet that bond.

32
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:51,010
Together, these routers transport
packets from one local area network,

33
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:54,010
to the Internet backbone,
and on to the destination,

34
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:58,080
local area network and
to the specific host on the network.

35
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:02,300
The routers can send traffic to the
correct destination on the Internet, but

36
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:05,920
as we have discussed, whether
the network should allow such traffic,

37
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,288
depends on security considerations.

38
00:02:08,288 --> 00:02:12,240
For example, traffic from another
trusted network such as a branch office

39
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:15,810
should be allowed to the trusted
network of the headquarter.

40
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:18,570
Another example,
traffic from untrusted network

41
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:22,110
should only be allowed to
the web service in the DMZ and

42
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:26,440
access from the DMZ to the trusted
network is again restricted.

43
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:30,590
In short, we need a device that can
enforce these different security

44
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:32,550
restrictions on traffic.

45
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:34,800
A firewall is such a device.

46
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,830
More precisely,

47
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:40,800
a firewall is a device that provide
secure connectivity between networks.

48
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,310
For example, between internal trusted
network to extended untrusted network.

49
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:48,960
It is used to implement and
enforce a security policy for

50
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,580
communication between the networks.
