1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,497
And the answer unfortunately is no, we can't solve this. Remember that when we

2
00:00:04,497 --> 00:00:09,009
used the square root sign without any sign explicitly indicated outside of it.

3
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:13,540
This gives us the positive square root of whatever quantity is inside. Because

4
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:17,749
we know then for sure this quantity on the left is positive, there is no way

5
00:00:17,749 --> 00:00:21,990
that it can equal a negative number. Which is what's on the right side. So even

6
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,554
thought we now know how to solve a ton of different looking equations, probably

7
00:00:25,554 --> 00:00:28,902
a lot of which it didn't seem at first like we did know how to solve, there are

8
00:00:28,902 --> 00:00:32,516
some that are just not mathematically possible. That has nothing to do with our

9
00:00:32,516 --> 00:00:36,050
math expertise, though. And you've done a really, really awesome job, on this

10
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:37,449
lesson and on the ones before.
