1
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:05,040
Starting from the top, the first
element has the attribute class.

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,830
And it is set to the value, right.

3
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:09,360
This matches up with our c.s.s.

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,360
So that works.

5
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,230
The second element also
has the attribute class.

6
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:17,340
But it is being set to
the value leftright.

7
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:22,060
Although right is part of the entire
value leftright, this won't work.

8
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:25,110
If we wanted to match on this element,
then we would need to change

9
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:30,860
the selector in our CSS to the entire
word leftright instead of just right.

10
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:35,790
Our third element has the attribute id
and it is being set to the value right.

11
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:37,740
This also doesn't work.

12
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:41,160
The reason why is because our CSS
statement is looking to match

13
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:42,630
on the class right.

14
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:43,640
Not the id right.

15
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:48,280
Finally, the fourth element
has the attribute class, and

16
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,520
it is set to three different values.

17
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:53,510
Highlight, module, and right.

18
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:56,810
While this seems like it wouldn't work,
it actually does.

19
00:00:56,810 --> 00:00:59,720
That's because you can set
multiple classes to an element,

20
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:02,110
as long as they are separated by spaces.

21
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:04,580
Also, the order of
the classes doesn't matter.
