00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:05,810
You know what, if you picked all of them you're right on. We've heard the term

2
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:11,570
virtualization in the context of virtual memory systems. Data centers today

3
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:14,350
catering to cloud computing use virtualization

4
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:18,190
technology. Java virtual machine. Virtual Box is

5
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:24,700
something that you may be using in your laptop for instance. An IBM VM/370,

6
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:27,480
was the mother of all virtualization in some

7
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,230
sense, because way back in the 60s and

8
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:33,090
the 70s, they pioneered this concept of virtualization.

9
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:34,990
Google Glass, of course many of you may

10
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:37,210
have heard the hype behind it, as well

11
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:42,530
as the opportunities for marketing that this provides.

12
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:45,680
Cloud computing, Dalvik Virtual Machine in the context

13
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:50,370
of Android, VMware Workstation as an alternative to

14
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:53,570
Virtual Box, and of course the movie, Inception,

15
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:55,700
has a lot of virtualization themes in it.
