00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:04,000
I'd like to take a moment and talk about the design of connectors.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
As with components there is a design step required, particularly if you're

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,870
building your own connector. Starting from the overall architecture, of course

4
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:16,540
you determine your components and the required interactions among them. Then for

5
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:21,640
each interaction, determine what required services that interaction needs.

6
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:26,635
Once you've done that you can select a con, connector type that provides that

7
00:00:26,635 --> 00:00:32,564
service. Each of the connector types has a variant of dimensions, variation

8
00:00:32,564 --> 00:00:38,210
dimensions, that you can choose which of those variants you would like to have.

9
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:44,180
And from that, define your connector. And then you need to validate. And we'll

10
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:48,150
have one in a minute we'll, we'll describe some of the rules you can use for

11
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:52,280
checking whether or not the, the choices you made will work out.

12
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:55,120
And in doing this you may actually have to define your own connector.

13
00:00:55,120 --> 00:01:00,900
You may not find one in the catalog or in available libraries that you can use.
