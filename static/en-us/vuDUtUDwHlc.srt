Here the correct answer is. Did you get them right? If so nice work. I know this

2
00:00:04,788 --> 00:00:09,278
last one is little bit tricky. So don't worry if you didn't get all of these

3
00:00:09,278 --> 00:00:14,879
right. For the first one we would have 6 7ths times 6 7ths or 6 squared over 7

4
00:00:14,879 --> 00:00:21,684
squared. So 36 over 49. For the next one I would have negative 3 squared and 4

5
00:00:21,684 --> 00:00:27,722
squared. So 9 divided by 16. And finally, for this last one, I have x divided by

6
00:00:27,722 --> 00:00:33,546
4 raised to the 0 power. Remember, any non-zero base raised to the 0 power is

7
00:00:33,546 --> 00:00:34,330
simply 1.
