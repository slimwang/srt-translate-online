1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,460
Let's look at some popular operating systems,

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:04,689
starting with the Linux architecture.

3
00:00:04,689 --> 00:00:07,270
This is what the Linux environment looks like.

4
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:12,240
Starting at the bottom, we have the hardware, and the Linux kernel abstracts and

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,350
manages that hardware by supporting a number of abstractions and

6
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:18,100
the associated mechanisms.

7
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:22,240
Then come a number of standard libraries, such as those that implement

8
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:26,370
the system call interfaces, followed by a number of utility programs that

9
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:31,210
make it easier for users and developers to interact with the operating system.

10
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:35,470
And, finally, at the very top, you have the user developed applications.

11
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:39,050
The kernel, itself, consists of several logical components,

12
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:43,420
like all of the the I/O management, memory management, process management.

13
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:47,000
And, these have well defined functionality, as well as interfaces.

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,310
Each of these separate components can be independently modified or replaced.

15
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:57,020
And, this makes the modular approach in Linux possible.

16
00:00:57,020 --> 00:01:02,160
The Mac OSX operating system, from Apple, uses a different organization.

17
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,280
At the core is the Mac micro kernel and

18
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,430
this implements key primitives like memory management, thread scheduling and

19
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:14,630
interprocess communication mechanisms including for, what we call RPC.

20
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:19,450
The BSD component provides Unix interoperability via a BSD

21
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:24,100
command line interface, POSIX API support as well as network I/O.

22
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:27,280
All application environments sit above this layer.

23
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:32,280
The bottom two modules are environments for development of drivers, and also for

24
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,310
kernel modules that can be dynamically loaded into the kernel.
