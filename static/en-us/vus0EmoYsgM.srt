00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:03,460
Let me just quickly now preview Harris Detector Algorithm.

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:06,730
And I'll also talk about the feature the other type of featured detection

3
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:10,020
methods, we'll cover them in detail in the next set of lectures.

4
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:11,320
So what basically what you do for

5
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:15,470
Harris Detector is we want to compute the Gaussian derivatives at each pixel.

6
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:18,008
Remember again, we have learned how to do Gaussian derivatives.

7
00:00:18,008 --> 00:00:22,660
Then we want to compute the second moment matrix M using the ix and

8
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:25,730
iys in a Gaussian window around each pixel.

9
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:29,420
Then we want to compute the corner response function R.

10
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:31,445
Again, we know how to compute R once we know M.

11
00:00:31,445 --> 00:00:35,620
We want to threshold R a little bit because you want to kind of have a,

12
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:38,500
you know, a lead as to how many corners we want to protect and

13
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:42,310
then we want to find a local maxima of response function.

14
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:45,800
I have a doc doing any kind of mon, maximum suppression.

15
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,610
Now what basically that means is now I can take an image like this, and

16
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:52,750
I would find a lot of features which are basically Harris detector features.

17
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:55,310
Again, we will cover this in detail in a future lecture.
