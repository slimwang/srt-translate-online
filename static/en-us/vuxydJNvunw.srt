00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,710
Not all Android users interact with
their devices in the same way.

2
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:08,340
And that is why it is important to make
sure your app is usable by anyone.

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:12,370
This includes users who have visual,
physical or age related limitations

4
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:15,800
that prevent them from fully seeing or
using a touch screen.

5
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:18,810
And users with hearing loss who
may not be able to perceive

6
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:20,860
audible information and alerts.

7
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:22,420
To make these considerations easy for

8
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:25,730
developers, Android provides
accessibility features that help

9
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:30,010
users navigate their devices more
easily including text-to-speech,

10
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:34,870
haptic feedback, gesture navigation,
trackball and directional navigation.

11
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:38,710
Even better, our experts have created a
nifty checklist to help developers know

12
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:41,500
what to focus on when making
their apps accessible.

13
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:42,660
So, let's take a look.
