00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:04,920
So, we just covered six different
caching strategies that you can use.

2
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:14,270
Cache first then network, network first
then cache, cache only, network only,

3
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:18,230
though I guess technically that's
not really cache and strategy, oops.

4
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:24,810
Cache and network race, and
finally cache then network.

5
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:29,090
It's important to choose the right
strategy for the right kind of data.

6
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:33,230
And don't be afraid to experiment or
even combine the different strategies.

7
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:36,670
If there are parts of your
app that you can't cache for

8
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:40,720
some reason, give the users
something fun to do in the meantime.

9
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:43,710
For example,
the Guardian newspaper in the UK

10
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:48,050
gives users a crossword puzzle
to play while they're offline.

11
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:52,160
If you want to dive deeper into
ways that you can cache content,

12
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,340

in the instructor notes below.
