00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:04,350
First of is Intermodel Consistency. The analysis process may have

2
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:08,070
produce multiple diagrams, each of which we can think of as a model.

3
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:11,852
These must be checked for inter-model consistency. For

4
00:00:11,852 --> 00:00:17,400
example, if you produce use cases, in, in the form of a use case diagram,

5
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,490
you want to make sure that you have some representation for

6
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:24,230
the individual use cases. Possibly in terms of a communication. Or

7
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:29,030
sequence diagram, and the names would have to match up.

8
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:32,970
Similarly, if you have classes that have complex behavior, you want to

9
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:38,310
make sure that you have a StateChart for those classes, and in the StateChart,

10
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:43,540
any events, actions and activities correspond to methods in the class model.

11
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:47,950
And, if you, have data conditions on your StateChart.

12
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:51,240
Those data conditions are going to refer to attributes. It had better be,

13
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:53,650
the case that those attributes are listed in your class model diagram.
