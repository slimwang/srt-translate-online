00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,700
So hopefully you found the link for the signals.h header file.

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:08,560
On that reference page, you will the table describing the signals and

3
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:11,340
their default actions and descriptions.

4
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:15,860
If you did not find that page, try searching for signal.h online.

5
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:17,770
Using that information as a reference,

6
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:21,580
you can see that the terminal interrupt signal is sickened.

7
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:26,410
For high bandwidth data is available on a socket, SIGURG is used.

8
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:29,830
For background process attempting write, SIGTTOU.

9
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:32,680
And for file size limit exceeded, SIGXFSZ.

10
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:36,760
So, now next time you need to see a signal reference,

11
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:37,700
you will know where to look.
