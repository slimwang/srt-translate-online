00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:04,607
Now that you have a handle on adding polynomials, let's try subtracting them.

2
00:00:04,608 --> 00:00:08,895
When we subtract polynomials we need to subtract the second quantity. We can

3
00:00:08,895 --> 00:00:13,370
think of this problem just like this problem. We know in this problem we don't

4
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:18,140
just subtract the one, we need to subtract a total of six. So we can subtract

5
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:23,420
the 1, subtract the 2 and subtract the 3. This is why these parentheses are so

6
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:28,100
important they indicate that when you subtract a total of 6 and not just a total

7
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:31,960
of 1. We get an answer of 9 here but this isn't so important, whats important is

8
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:36,438
what we did right here. We distributed a negative 1, we're going to use the same

9
00:00:36,438 --> 00:00:41,530
line of thinking for tackling this whenever you subtract a quantity, you want to

10
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:46,305
change every single sign because we're multiplying by a negative one. So I

11
00:00:46,305 --> 00:00:51,247
multiply each term by negative 1 and really that just changes all their signs.

12
00:00:51,248 --> 00:00:55,040
You don't have to show this step in your problem solving, but if it helps, you

13
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:59,277
do it. Here's our expression after we multiply by negative 1. Once we're here we

14
00:00:59,277 --> 00:01:04,340
carry out the problem just like addition. We regroup our like terms, and then we

15
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:09,203
combine them x squared plus 2x plus 2. Here's our final polynomial.
