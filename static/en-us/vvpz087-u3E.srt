We know each side weighed 8 pounds each. Then we added 100 pounds to both sides,

2
00:00:04,557 --> 00:00:09,014
so we have 108 pounds on both sides, so they must weigh the same. Not only can I

3
00:00:09,026 --> 00:00:13,534
add 100 pounds to both sides of the scale, I could also think about removing 100

4
00:00:13,546 --> 00:00:17,928
pounds from both sides of the scale. If I remove 100 pounds from both sides of

5
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:22,988
the scale, then I'd be back at 8 pounds. 8 pounds on the left and 8 pounds on

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,534
the right. This is one of the most important concepts in algebra. We want to be

7
00:00:27,546 --> 00:00:31,838
able to add a number to both sides of an equation and subtract a number from

8
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:36,270
both sides of an equation. It's the Properties of Equality. If you chose the

9
00:00:36,282 --> 00:00:37,611
last answer, nice work.
