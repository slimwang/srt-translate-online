Light makes right. I love this little play on words that Andrew Glassner made

2
00:00:03,824 --> 00:00:07,495
up back in the 1980s. It succinctly captures a kernel of truth about computer

3
00:00:07,495 --> 00:00:10,222
graphics. The more you can determine about how light moves through an

4
00:00:10,222 --> 00:00:13,520
environment, the better your results will be. I've talked a bit before about

5
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:17,352
light, and how it bounces around a scene, eventually reaching the eye. The idea

6
00:00:17,352 --> 00:00:21,499
is that each light, often called an emitter, sends photons out. The fate of

7
00:00:21,499 --> 00:00:25,107
each photon is that it's absorbed as is, or reflected. An object can absorb

8
00:00:25,107 --> 00:00:28,650
light and in fact, almost everything absorbs at least a little light. Not even

9
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:32,610
the highest quality mirror reflects 100% of the light hitting it. The numbers

10
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:36,523
are usually more in the 90 to 95% range. Along the way photons can be absorbed

11
00:00:36,523 --> 00:00:40,204
by dust, water droplets, or other particles in the air. Or the inside of

12
00:00:40,204 --> 00:00:43,845
translucent objects themselves. This simple photon model ignores various

13
00:00:43,845 --> 00:00:47,750
effects such as polarization and fluorescence. But that's generally fine in

14
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:51,530
indirective computer graphics. Things are complex enough. We can see objects

15
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:55,780
precisely because photons ultimately travel from them to us. The reason objects

16
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:58,525
have different colors is that each varies in how much it reflects various

17
00:00:58,525 --> 00:01:02,043
wavelengths of light. Where we do have some choice in computer graphics is what

18
00:01:02,043 --> 00:01:05,455
light paths we follow. The two paths we've used so far are light to surface and

19
00:01:05,455 --> 00:01:08,892
surface to eye. We've been a bit more elaborate with surface to eye in that

20
00:01:08,892 --> 00:01:12,599
we've allowed transparent filters along this path to modify the color.
