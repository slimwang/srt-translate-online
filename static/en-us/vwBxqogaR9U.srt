1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,590
So let's look at what the Harris
Detector algorithm looks like in

2
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:04,641
each and every step.

3
00:00:04,641 --> 00:00:07,955
So, first step, we want to do for
Harris Corner Detection is compute

4
00:00:07,955 --> 00:00:10,654
the horizontal and
vertical derivatives of the image.

5
00:00:10,654 --> 00:00:14,616
And, again, if you recall, we have
learned how to do this in an earlier

6
00:00:14,616 --> 00:00:18,250
lecture by using, basically,
how to compute derivatives, and

7
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:23,190
also doing to get towards computations
towards things like gradient images.

8
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:27,518
And another thing we want to do is we
want to actually now compute information

9
00:00:27,518 --> 00:00:29,421
from the gradients to compute M.

10
00:00:29,421 --> 00:00:32,648
Then, we, actually, kind of want
to smooth it out a little bit, and

11
00:00:32,648 --> 00:00:34,820
that's why we take a larger
Gaussian image and

12
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:37,492
take this image that we get and
smooth it out a little bit,

13
00:00:37,492 --> 00:00:40,750
because we want to kind of get more
information out of the signal here.

14
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:44,508
Then, we actually start measuring
scalar interest measure.

15
00:00:44,508 --> 00:00:47,873
And I encourage you to look at more
details on where are the books that

16
00:00:47,873 --> 00:00:52,330
could be available and the material
that are make available on this one.

17
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:56,008
And then, we want to basically find
maximum value above some threshold, and

18
00:00:56,008 --> 00:00:57,432
those would be the features.

19
00:00:57,432 --> 00:01:00,253
So, this is a step by step
method on how we can actually do

20
00:01:00,253 --> 00:01:01,641
Harris Corner Detection.

21
00:01:01,641 --> 00:01:03,280
Let's look at more details on this one.
