00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,847
Absolute value signs are sort of like a type of parenthesis, in that when we use

2
00:00:03,847 --> 00:00:07,800
them with expressions, we simplify the part of the expression that's inside the

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:11,576
absolute value signs, before we deal with our entire quantity in relation to

4
00:00:11,576 --> 00:00:15,324
other things. So, I'd like you to find the absolute value of each of these

5
00:00:15,324 --> 00:00:19,344
quantities, and when you do that, first simply what's inside the absolute value

6
00:00:19,344 --> 00:00:22,151
signs, and then take the absolute value of that number.
