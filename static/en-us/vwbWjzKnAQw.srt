00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:02,340
Great job on finishing lesson two.

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:04,880
At this rate,
you'll be a professional in no time.

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:08,600
In this lesson, you created a web
server in Python, learned what GET and

4
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:11,720
POST requests are and
how to create code to handle them, and

5
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:15,260
implemented all CRUD operations
via web pages and forms.

6
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:17,500
So, now you've learned the basic
underlying concepts of

7
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:20,460
creating a data-driven web
app using just Python.

8
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:23,410
In lesson three, you'll be developing
a new web server, but this time,

9
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:25,370
using a framework to help
you code more efficiently.
