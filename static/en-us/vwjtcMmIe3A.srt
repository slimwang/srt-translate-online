2
00:00:07,226 --> 00:00:11,366
I think you can gain a measure of
success coming from either the bottom up

3
00:00:11,366 --> 00:00:14,580
or the top down, but
I think there's a limitation.

4
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:18,310
So, I think it really it
takes the whole village.

5
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:21,140
We can start from the bottom, and
we can get a measure of success.

6
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:23,260
You can automate infrastructure.

7
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:25,604
You can start to spread some
knowledge about those practices.

8
00:00:25,604 --> 00:00:28,000
You can start from the top.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:28,820
You can mandate.
Or you can

10
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:30,724
try to create
an environment in which you

11
00:00:30,724 --> 00:00:33,862
are looking to avoid snowflakes
in your production environment.

12
00:00:33,862 --> 00:00:37,440
And that kind of messaging
will go some way.

13
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,244
But at some point,
you need a common or shared goal.

14
00:00:40,244 --> 00:00:44,768
I think this is where the XP principle
of a shared metaphor is really important

15
00:00:44,768 --> 00:00:46,730
organizationally.

16
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:49,760
You want everyone to understand the
context around what better looks like.

17
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:56,540
And I think that that can't come
just from the line of execution.

18
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:59,000
In the same way that it
cannot come from the top.

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,364
I think in lean there's this idea of
going to the place where the work

20
00:01:03,364 --> 00:01:04,063
happens.

21
00:01:04,063 --> 00:01:05,433
It's going to the gamba.

22
00:01:05,433 --> 00:01:07,856
And I think that's a great metaphor for

23
00:01:07,856 --> 00:01:11,971
how the leadership in an organization
and the line of execution can

24
00:01:11,971 --> 00:01:16,030
come together to make a DevOps
transformation super effective.
