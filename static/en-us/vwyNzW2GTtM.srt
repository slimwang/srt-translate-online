1
00:00:00,268 --> 00:00:03,980
Anyway, unary constraints restrict
the value of a given variable,

2
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:06,189
like saying Tasmania can't be purple.

3
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:08,949
>> Binary constraints relate
at most two variables,

4
00:00:08,949 --> 00:00:11,309
we can represent those
with a constraint graph.

5
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:14,740
>> Here's a constraint graph for
our Australia coloring problem.

6
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:17,795
Nodes are the variables,
like western Australia,

7
00:00:17,795 --> 00:00:22,089
south Australia, Queensland, etc.

8
00:00:22,089 --> 00:00:24,690
Arcs show the constraints
between the variables.

9
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:27,630
>> We can apply general purpose
constraint satisfaction problem

10
00:00:27,629 --> 00:00:30,789
algorithms to the graph structure to
speed up our search for an answer.

11
00:00:30,789 --> 00:00:33,750
For example, Tasmania is independent
from the rest of the problem.
