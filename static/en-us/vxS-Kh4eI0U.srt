1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,880
In this case, the outlier was an example of bad data

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:06,320
about an extreme case. The respondent in Moira's study said that

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:09,970
they had over 1 million friends. Moira's outlier had a value

4
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:13,590
of 10 million, which isn't possible using Facebook. So that would

5
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:16,510
be an example of bad data in an extreme case since

6
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:19,560
we're at the higher end of people who saw the post.

7
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,200
In general, I think it's really important that we think about

8
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:25,500
What type of case or categories that our outliers fall into.

9
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,740
This may help us think about how we can adjust for the outliers, or

10
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:31,630
replace them or exclude them for our data, if we want to make those decisions.
