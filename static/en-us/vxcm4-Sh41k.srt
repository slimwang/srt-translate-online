00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:01,130
The answer is no.

2
00:00:01,130 --> 00:00:02,340
In its current state,

3
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:05,480
the code will break when it hits the line calling amy.move.

4
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:09,430
That's because the move method is only available on Car.prototype and

5
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:12,884
the amy object doesn't delegate to Car.prototype.
