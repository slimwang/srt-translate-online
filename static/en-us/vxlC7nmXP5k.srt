00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,610
So here are the expressions we get when we combine our functions, f of x and g

2
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:11,055
of x, in these different ways. G minus f of x, gives us x squared minus 2x. F

3
00:00:11,055 --> 00:00:16,713
plus g of x, gives us x squared. Fg of x, which remember, is the same thing as

4
00:00:16,713 --> 00:00:23,588
f times g of x, gives us, x cubed, minus x squared. And, last but not least, g,

5
00:00:23,588 --> 00:00:26,933
over f of x, gives x minus 1.
