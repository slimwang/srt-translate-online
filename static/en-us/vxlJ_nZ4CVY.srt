00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:04,430
So some Comments on Postconditions. First of all, we've only been concerned so

2
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:09,080
far with pure functions. And a pure function is one in which the output

3
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:13,030
is completely determined by the input. However, in real programming languages,

4
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:17,700
computational units like functions, procedures and methods may be impure. For

5
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:21,090
impure functions, in addition to describing how the output relates to

6
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:25,480
the input you should also indicate any side effect. These include changes to

7
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:31,260
global variables and any operations like input and output that

8
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:36,400
aren't reflected in the results of the function. And if we're talking about and

9
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:40,470
OO. That is, an object oriented programming language, then changes to any

10
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:45,850
instance variables of the of, of the object that we're dealing with,

11
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:50,270
are also things that we would have to express inside the post conditions. But so

12
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:52,940
far, with square root we don't have to worry about that.

13
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:57,210
And it's also the cates that, that sort is going to be a pure function, so

14
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:58,140
we don't have to worry about it there.
