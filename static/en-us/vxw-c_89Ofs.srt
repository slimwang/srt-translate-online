1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:04,440
We're going to consider
now the intrinsic value of

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:06,380
our one dollar machine.

3
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:09,920
In other words, this machine
generates one dollar every year.

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:11,540
Now to understand that,

5
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:16,520
we need to think about what is
the future value of a dollar.

6
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:17,900
What do I mean by that?

7
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:22,440
Well, let's suppose I told you,
hey look, awesome student,

8
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,840
I promise I will give you $1 in a year.

9
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:31,540
How much would you pay me today
on the basis of that promise?

10
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:35,660
In other words,
maybe you would pay me 80 cents, and

11
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:40,000
then in a year I give you $1,
maybe you would pay me more.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,620
Think for
a moment about how much you would pay me

13
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:45,400
given my promise that I'll give
you a dollar a year from now.

14
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:49,920
Okay I want you to consider
these three assets.

15
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,970
One of them is a dollar right now,
in other words I

16
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:57,857
pull a dollar bill out of my pocket and
I give it to you right now.

17
00:00:57,857 --> 00:01:05,360
Another is, I, Tucker Balch,
promise to give you a dollar in a year.

18
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,580
Now that's a promise you can abide by,
you can trust me, I'm your professor,

19
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:11,300
I'm going to give you
that dollar in a year.

20
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:17,050
But what you need to think about is,
what's the value of that

21
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:21,190
promise or that bond, considering
that it won't happen for a year.

22
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:26,490
And finally, consider this
asset where the US government

23
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:29,610
promises to give you a dollar in a year.

24
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:35,930
Now I want you to rank each of
these assets, a one dollar bill,

25
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:40,090
a United States of America bond,
or a Balch promise,

26
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:44,770
a Balch bond, to pay you $1 in a year.

27
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:48,730
How would you rate these one through
three where one is the best,

28
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:50,240
where three is the worst?

29
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,420
How would you rank these three assets?

30
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:56,810
In other words, which would you rather
have if you had to choose one or

31
00:01:56,810 --> 00:02:00,270
the other where one is the best and
three is the worst?
