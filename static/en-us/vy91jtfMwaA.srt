00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,469
Now that you've seen
expert do user research,

2
00:00:02,469 --> 00:00:04,230
take some time to do it yourself.

3
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:07,680
Go to the last person you chose in the
last quiz, and sit down with them and

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,000
conduct your research.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,960
It's very likely some of your feedback
will be the same as the feedback

6
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:13,160
we just got.

7
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:16,059
But it's also very likely that
some of it will be different.

8
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:19,860
Remember, the important parts here
are to avoid guiding the user too much,

9
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:22,130
to make a note of where
they get confused and

10
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:25,260
to see how they go about doing
the things you ask them to do.

11
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:26,630
Check the box here
[SOUND] when you're done.
