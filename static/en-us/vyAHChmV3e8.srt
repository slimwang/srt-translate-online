>> This is definitely going to be a big issue for us to help Grant tackle. So, I

2
00:00:03,482 --> 00:00:07,267
think we should break this problem-solving down. I also recognize that there are

3
00:00:07,267 --> 00:00:10,292
a lot of words on the screen right now, and that can definitely feel

4
00:00:10,292 --> 00:00:14,056
overwhelming. But if we just take things step-by-step, we can figure this out.

5
00:00:14,056 --> 00:00:17,737
Let's start by talking about what we actually know right now. What information

6
00:00:17,737 --> 00:00:21,680
does the problem give us? Read through this problem statement again, and then

7
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,391
tell me, what do we already know. Do we know how much Grant should spend on

8
00:00:25,391 --> 00:00:29,378
nozzle machinery? Do we know how many nozzles he should make per month? Do we

9
00:00:29,378 --> 00:00:33,431
know how much materials for each nozzle cost? Or do we know how much Grant wants

10
00:00:33,431 --> 00:00:35,368
to spend total on nozzle production?
