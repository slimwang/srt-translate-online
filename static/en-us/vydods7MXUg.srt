1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:04,220
The objectives of this lesson are for
you to learn about image warping.

2
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:08,109
We will specifically talk about
forward and inverse warping,

3
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:11,320
the kinds of image warping
techniques that are widely in use.

4
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:15,920
Then we'll talk about how we can
actually do the warping using a mesh.

5
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:19,190
With this, I'm going to introduce
the concept of image morphing.

6
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:23,060
And specifically, the feature-based
image morphing technology that's widely

7
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:26,400
in use, and you've seen it many of
times in different types of movies.
