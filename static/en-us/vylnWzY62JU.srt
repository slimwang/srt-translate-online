00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Now I want to talk about a strategy for defining the function fill_in,

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:12,000
which takes an unfilled formula and returns all the possible filled in formulas.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
What do we have to do?

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Well, let's consider a formula, and I'm going to take one that's simpler

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
than one we've seen before.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I'm going to take the formula I plus I equals me.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
What we have to do then is find out what all the letters are in this formula

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
and fill in all possible values for digits for those letters.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
It seems like a good thing is to collect all the letters,

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:50,000
and in this particular formula the letters should be IME.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
What are the possible digits that we want to replace these three letters with?

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Well, we can just iterate through all the 3-digit numbers,

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
but make sure that we're not duplicating any of those numbers.

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:17,000
So maybe we'll start with 123, then 124, and so on, 120, and then 13.

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
We wouldn't do 131, because we already have a 1 there, so 132,

16
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
13--can't do 133, so 134, and so on and so on.

17
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
We just have all these possibilities.

18
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
How many possibilities are there?

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Well, there's 10 possible first digits.

20
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Then we don't want to repeat a digit, so 9 possible second digits,

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
and 8 possible third digits, so that's 720 possibilities.

22
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Not very many at all. It should be really fast to go through all these possibilities.

23
00:01:49,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Now, what function gives me all the possible sets of numbers in order--so order matters.

24
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:10,000
120, for, example is different than 012 or 201 and so on.

25
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
What function is it that we give it the list of digits?

26
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
so we want some function F, we give it the list of digits,

27
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
and we give it the number that we want, and there are three letters

28
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
in this particular formula, so we want three of them.

29
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:34,000
What function F takes that and then returns this sequence of all possible sets of numbers?

30
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Maybe it returns it as a tuple or a list or whatever.

31
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
The question is what function can do that.

32
00:02:42,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Is it combinations, permutations, factorial, or some other function?
