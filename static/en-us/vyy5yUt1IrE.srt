00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,328
For the most part, we're going to focus on normally distributed data. There are

2
00:00:05,328 --> 00:00:10,802
many kinds of normal distributions. Stretched, skinny, or maybe somewhere in the

3
00:00:10,802 --> 00:00:15,893
middle. But the area underneath will always be 1, or 100%. You've also seen

4
00:00:15,893 --> 00:00:21,028
before that in a normally distributed data set, the mean, median, and mode are

5
00:00:21,028 --> 00:00:26,381
approximately equal. In our theoretical model, they're exactly equal. Our

6
00:00:26,381 --> 00:00:31,872
theoretical model is perfectly symmetrical. This doesn't usually happen in real

7
00:00:31,872 --> 00:00:37,479
life. These models approximate our real distributions. But we can usually get

8
00:00:37,479 --> 00:00:43,446
pretty good approximations. And in our theoretical model, most of the data is in

9
00:00:43,446 --> 00:00:49,029
the middle clustered around the mean, median and mode. You might recall from the

10
00:00:49,029 --> 00:00:54,533
last lesson that approximately 68% lie within one standard deviation of the

11
00:00:54,533 --> 00:00:58,812
mean. And 95% fall within 2 standard deviations of the mean.
