00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,616
Now let's use some numbers and variables. It turns out that after one month of

2
00:00:04,628 --> 00:00:09,436
just producing wipers, Grant had spent $5,685. I'd like you to think about the

3
00:00:09,448 --> 00:00:14,281
last equation that we came up with in the previous quiz, and write a new version

4
00:00:14,293 --> 00:00:19,058
of it, including all this information. I'd also like you to call the number of

5
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:23,597
wiper sets made in a month, x. Please write your new equation for the situation

6
00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:27,823
in this box. And leave out any dollar signs that you might want to include for

7
00:00:27,835 --> 00:00:28,025
now.
