1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,550
For any trait, there are usually variations.

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:04,010
>> So wait, are you talking about things

3
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:07,100
like eye color, like blue, green, brown, hazel.

4
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:10,920
>> Right, exactly. Eye color is an example of a single trait,

5
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:14,350
but for that one trait you can have different versions or variants;

6
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:19,170
brown, green, blue. Variation is a huge theme in this course. And

7
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:21,040
it's important to recognize that different

8
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:24,260
people have different perspectives on different variations.

9
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:25,350
>> It's true,

10
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:27,480
I guess. I've always liked hazel eyes.

11
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,600
>> And why have you always liked hazel eyes?

12
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,180
>> I don't know. I just think they're better.

13
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:32,960
>> And I guess that's sort of

14
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,480
what we're talking about. The word better sometimes

15
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:39,220
implies that there's a good or bad eye color to begin with. We don't really want

16
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:41,590
to do that. For the most part, good

17
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:44,520
and bad shouldn't be used to reference personal

18
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,780
preference. Instead, for our course, we'll reserve the

19
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:50,360
word bad only for variations of traits that

20
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:52,930
cause serious health conditions, or even fatality.

21
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:55,190
>> Fair enough. So I want to know what

22
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:58,590
you think. What traits are better or worse than

23
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:02,030
other traits? These can be physical, personality or behavioral

24
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:04,470
traits. List one in each one of these boxes.
