1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,410
In this exercise, you'll start
setting up the GigaGal class,

2
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:06,550
including giving GigaGal a position and
velocity,

3
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:10,800
giving her a simplistic update method,
and allowing her to draw herself.

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,990
You'll also start working
on the Level class,

5
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:17,470
which will hold on to all of the objects
in a single level of GigaGal.

6
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:20,360
When you're done, the results won't
look super different from the end of

7
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:25,060
the last exercise, but at least
GigaGal is standing on the ground now.

8
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:27,850
Check out the to-dos in the course
code to allow GigaGal to

9
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:30,650
keep track of her position and
draw her sprite in the right spot.
