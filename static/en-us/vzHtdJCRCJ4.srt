1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:01,200
What was your answer David?

2
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:05,110
>> So means-ends analysis always
chooses the state that most

3
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:08,060
reduces the distance to the goal state.

4
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:10,045
In this case,
that would be the third option,

5
00:00:10,045 --> 00:00:12,130
because it reduces
the distance down to two.

6
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:13,020
>> That's correct David.
