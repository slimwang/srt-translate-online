00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,950
So let's take a look at our Jersey Square team and see what they've done with channels.

2
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:08,690
By the time they've gotten to this part in the canvas, they've actually recognized that

3
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:13,800
besides working on channels they actually have two distinct customer segments,

4
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:17,510
sport jersey owners and single-game attendees.

5
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:21,740
And just if you remember, by the time you understand you have multiple segments,

6
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:26,910
that means you need multiple value propositions and multiple revenue streams.

7
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:33,620
And you might also have multiple channels in customer relationships but at least at this point

8
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:39,500
and they're thinking the only thing that matches the channels are the value prop and revenue streams.

9
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:42,530
And so let's see what they've learned about the channels.

10
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:47,710
In getting out of the building, they understood that both segments, the sports jersey owners

11
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:53,510
and the single-game attendees, really liked the idea of going to their website

12
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:57,510
and actually being able to buy or rent a jersey.

13
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:05,069
But their hypothesis that stadium shop owners and vendors would be a channel and/or a partner

14
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:07,490
early on turned out to be incorrect.

15
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:12,940
In talking to those two channels, they discovered that they viewed Jersey Square

16
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:19,220
as a potential competitor and they also understood the sales cycle of selling to them as a channel

17
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:23,440
but it was going to be a lot longer than they had to start up their company.

18
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:28,200
And so they kind of put this off the list for now and they might get back to this later.

19
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:34,290
They also started looking at direct mail and realized that direct mail was nothing more than a potential

20
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:40,990
customer acquisition activity rather than a channel itself so that just left them with a direct website

21
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:45,780
and potentially ticket websites and remember your goal as a start up is not to make

22
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:50,050
the longest list of potential channels but in fact to narrow down

23
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:54,680
what is it you're going to be focusing on in your early days.
