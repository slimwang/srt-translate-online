00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Welcome to office hours for Unit 2.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
We'll get started right away with questions.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Let's start with Catherine from New Hampshire.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
She says, "I believe there were at least one or two instances where I

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
gave up in frustration and viewed a solution before getting a correct

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
answer in a unit quiz."

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
She wants to know, what do the unit quizzes mean?

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Should she be concerned if she gets it right?

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Should she be frustrated if she's getting them wrong?

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I hope people aren't frustrated on the unit quizzes.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The quizzes in the units are really there to help keep you engaged--

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
to help you learn.

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
If you can't get the answer, that's okay that we do have

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
answers recorded after them.

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
You're not being graded on the quizzes.

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
They are really there to help you learn.

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Some of the quizzes are harder than others.

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
One of the things that we do on the quizzes is rate them with gold stars.

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Don't be surprised if you're not necessarily able to handle

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
those with gold stars.

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Those are questions that will require a lot of thought.

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Those are going to be really hard, especially for beginning students.

23
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Those are questions that--I hope by thinking about them--you'll be

24
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
able to solve yourself.

25
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
If you're not able to solve it yourself, don't get frustrated.

26
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
You can watch the answer--hopefully you'll understand the answer--

27
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
and then maybe you'll be able to try it on your own again

28
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
after you've seen the answer.

29
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
The quizzes don't count towards your grade.

30
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
You shouldn't be frustrated or stressed about that.

31
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
They are really there to help you learn.
