00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,410
So files are objects that we can write into and read from. Before we can read or

2
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:08,750
write into a file we need to open it, and we can do that using the built in open

3
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:13,090
operation, which takes a file name and a mode and it returns an instance of a

4
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:17,892
file. File is a built-in type. The file name and mode are strings. The file name

5
00:00:17,892 --> 00:00:24,231
identifies the file. So for example we could do open Passing in gim.py gimpy as

6
00:00:24,231 --> 00:00:30,709
the name of the file and as the mode we could pass in R for reading. As another

7
00:00:30,709 --> 00:00:37,924
example we can use a full path name so we could use users/dave/ log.out to write

8
00:00:37,924 --> 00:00:43,090
to the file log.out. There are different modes that we can use for example if

9
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:47,500
this is really a log What might make more sense is instead of using just the w,

10
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:51,980
which would replace what's there if you use w plus, it will append to what's in

11
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:53,953
the current logged it out file.
