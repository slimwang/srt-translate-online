1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:04,570
So you just calculated the point estimate. What about our interval estimate?

2
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:09,495
Because we know that the population mean will probably be somewhere around 0.13.

3
00:00:09,495 --> 00:00:14,554
And remember this is the population mean if we gave everyone an access to this

4
00:00:14,554 --> 00:00:19,306
musical lesson. So what's the standard error of the mean that we would use to

5
00:00:19,306 --> 00:00:24,042
compare this sample mean with the means of other samples of the same size from

6
00:00:24,042 --> 00:00:27,663
this population? Again round to the nearest thousandths.
