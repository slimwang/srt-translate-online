00:00:00,004 --> 00:00:00,724
Hey again.

2
00:00:00,724 --> 00:00:03,300
Now that you're well familiar
with kinds and properties,

3
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:06,297
let's talk about what goes into
a data store kind for user profiles.

4
00:00:06,297 --> 00:00:08,456
Let's do in the same way we did recipes.

5
00:00:08,456 --> 00:00:11,358
What do we need to store for
users of our conference app?

6
00:00:11,358 --> 00:00:13,739
Unlike a recipe,
where we have one type of user,

7
00:00:13,739 --> 00:00:15,375
our cook who is storing recipes.

8
00:00:15,375 --> 00:00:18,397
This time we have two different
kinds of users, those who create and

9
00:00:18,397 --> 00:00:19,458
manage conferences and

10
00:00:19,458 --> 00:00:23,084
those who are looking for conferences,
registering for them and going to them.

11
00:00:23,084 --> 00:00:26,860
But we need to save information for both
of those types of users in one kind and

12
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,749
we're going to name that kind Profile.

13
00:00:28,749 --> 00:00:32,162
So the first thing we need is a unique
identifier for the entities key.

14
00:00:32,162 --> 00:00:34,879
Now we need to decide what data
we need in a user profile.

15
00:00:34,879 --> 00:00:36,667
First, we'll have displayName.

16
00:00:36,667 --> 00:00:39,565
That's the name that users want to have
printed on their conference badges,

17
00:00:39,565 --> 00:00:42,031
that might be different from
the name on their account after all.

18
00:00:42,031 --> 00:00:45,699
Maybe Jennifer Smith wants to be
called Jen, or Jenny or maybe Unicorn.

19
00:00:45,699 --> 00:00:47,812
Next, we need the user's email address.

20
00:00:47,812 --> 00:00:50,111
We're going to call this mainEmail for
now.

21
00:00:50,111 --> 00:00:53,666
At some point, you might want to extend
this with home and work emails and

22
00:00:53,666 --> 00:00:57,104
need to decide, which is primary or
support another email address for

23
00:00:57,104 --> 00:00:59,515
their mobile device to
send them text messages.

24
00:00:59,515 --> 00:01:01,627
But for now, we'll just have mainEmail.

25
00:01:01,627 --> 00:01:04,483
And the next very important
thing is your teeShirtSize.

26
00:01:04,483 --> 00:01:07,735
People certainly do appreciate having
the right sized t-shirt when they go to

27
00:01:07,735 --> 00:01:08,385
a conference.

28
00:01:08,385 --> 00:01:09,894
Now, it's time for
you to think about these.

29
00:01:09,894 --> 00:01:12,611
What sorts of properties
are each of these fields?

30
00:01:12,611 --> 00:01:15,827
Use your imagination and if you need to
look up the various property types you

31
00:01:15,827 --> 00:01:18,602
can use, check out the docks
linked to the Instructor's Notes.

32
00:01:18,602 --> 00:01:21,690
For each field,
fill in an appropriate property type.

33
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:25,246
Be careful when filling in the answers,
because like other Python identifiers,

34
00:01:25,246 --> 00:01:26,440
these are case sensitive.
