1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:05,350
Again, this is a type of t test. It uses the t distribution and the t table. We

2
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:09,670
won't tell you how to calculate the t statistic, we'll just assume that you'll

3
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:13,580
use a computer to conduct it. And by now you should be able to know the

4
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:18,190
interpretation of whatever t statistic comes out for the output. Then you'll

5
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:22,090
know when to reject or fail to reject the null. The degrees of freedom are

6
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:26,060
important, though. And again that's just like when we did hypothesis testing

7
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:32,095
with R. The degrees of freedom are N minus 2. Where N is the number of data

8
00:00:32,095 --> 00:00:38,380
points. So we have N values of X, and N values of Y. For example, let's say

9
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:42,670
you're measureing the relationship between two variables, X and Y. And you have

10
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:48,820
nine data points. So nine values of X, the independent variable and nine values

11
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:53,810
of Y, the dependent variable. And let's say we do a non-directional test at

12
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:58,210
alpha equals point zero five. And then let's say that we calculate our T

13
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:04,360
statistic and we get five point seven seven. What can we conclude, their is or

14
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:10,430
their is not. Enough evidence to reject the null, meaning there does or there

15
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:15,399
does not appear to be a significant relationship between X and Y.
