1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,510
When we heard all of those different
languages what we were really hearing

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:06,460
was a communication system
that was specific to Homo Sapiens,

3
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:10,260
which is human language.
Human language is open and symbolic.

4
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:15,750
It has rules of grammar that allows user
to express abstract and distant ideas.

5
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:20,338
By open, we mean that the system
is dynamic, and it's free to change.

6
00:00:20,338 --> 00:00:23,166
In fact, we see changes
in language across time

7
00:00:23,166 --> 00:00:27,622
when words take on new meanings.
Or new slang words appear. So in language,

8
00:00:27,622 --> 00:00:32,289
we have words which are put together
into specific rules of syntax and grammar.

9
00:00:32,289 --> 00:00:36,110
So, grammar, then, is the entire
set of rules for combining symbols

10
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:39,625
and sounds to speak and write
a particular language.

11
00:00:39,631 --> 00:00:43,763
So, each language has its own
distinct sounds for saying things.

12
00:00:43,763 --> 00:00:46,041
Just as we saw in the beginning
of the lesson,

13
00:00:46,041 --> 00:00:49,805
when many of our Udacity friends said
a version of, I think, therefore I am.
