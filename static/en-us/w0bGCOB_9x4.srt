00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:01,930
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01,930 --> 00:00:04,990
In this lesson, you'll be developing
your very own portfolio page,

3
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:06,500
which you'll be able to
share with the world.

4
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:09,870
I know the layout looks different than
what you did before in the first lesson,

5
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:11,050
but don't worry.

6
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:14,160
I'll be helping you with an approach
that will make your life easier

7
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,260
by creating a CSS framework that you can
use in this project, in future projects.

8
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:21,360
You'll be able to make beautiful
pages like this without any problem.

9
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:24,980
Along the way, you'll be developing your
portfolio following responsive design

10
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:28,300
principles, which means that your
website is going to look great for

11
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:29,870
everyone, regardless of their device.

12
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:31,590
Are you ready to get started?
