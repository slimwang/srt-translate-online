Before we get started leaning about polynomials, lets actually start off with

2
00:00:04,038 --> 00:00:08,079
some shapes. Here's some different shapes and some names of them. What I want

3
00:00:08,079 --> 00:00:12,109
you to is to determine which shapes are 2 dimensional and which shapes are 3

4
00:00:12,109 --> 00:00:13,226
dimensional. A 2 dimensional shape is something that's flat that we can pick up.

5
00:00:13,226 --> 00:00:19,322
A three dimensional would be something that we can hold like a pen or pencil.

6
00:00:19,322 --> 00:00:24,934
What I want you to do is to classify these shapes and let me know if they are 2

7
00:00:24,934 --> 00:00:28,823
dimensional or if they're 3 dimensional. Go ahead.
