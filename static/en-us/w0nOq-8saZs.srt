00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,417
Here, the product was 2x squared minus 1x minus 6. If you got this, you're quite

2
00:00:04,417 --> 00:00:08,836
the pro at multiplying binomials. Now, I know I threw a negative sign at you. So

3
00:00:08,836 --> 00:00:13,128
it's okay if you got stuck. There's also a coefficient of 2 here. So that might

4
00:00:13,128 --> 00:00:18,594
have thrown you off. I'm going to start by listing the factors on each side of

5
00:00:18,594 --> 00:00:23,152
my rectangle. I'll have 2x plus 3 and x minus 2. So I'll have 2x times x, which

6
00:00:23,152 --> 00:00:28,479
is 2x squared. Then I'll have 2x times negative 2, which is negative 4x. Notice

7
00:00:28,479 --> 00:00:33,363
that we're distributing or multiplying the 2x in the first parenthesis to each

8
00:00:33,363 --> 00:00:38,544
term in the second parenthesis. That also happens in our rectangles. Then I'll

9
00:00:38,544 --> 00:00:43,832
do 3 times x, which is 3x. And finally by making a little bit more room, I'll

10
00:00:43,832 --> 00:00:49,281
have 3 times negative 2, which is negative 6, our last area of our rectangle.

11
00:00:49,281 --> 00:00:54,642
And finally, we combine our like terms, the negative 4x and the 3x, to get our

12
00:00:54,642 --> 00:00:55,295
answer.
