1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:03,457
Finally, I want to say a word about collaboration-based design.

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:09,860
When we did object-oriented analysis, we were essentially picking out

3
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:14,030
the important objects in the description of the real world.

4
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:18,480
And we're using those as the basis of deciding on classes and and

5
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,160
the associations among them.

6
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,640
And eventually we got to the stage where we were mentioning methods that

7
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,425
the classes might provide as services.

8
00:00:26,425 --> 00:00:32,659
Collaboration-based design takes a somewhat contrary approach to things.

9
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:37,100
In particular it's concerned, it starts with use cases.

10
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:41,350
Individual use cases sometimes called user stories or scenarios.

11
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,240
And with these use cases,

12
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:51,000
each use case has various actors playing a specific role for that use case.

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,510
Collaboration design, by the way, is sometimes called role-based design.

14
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:59,270
So we can say that for a particular actor, participating in

15
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:03,710
a particular use case, that actor's fulfilling some kind of role.

16
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:05,220
So let's specify that role.

17
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,840
That role takes the form of the actions that,

18
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,540
that user takes in that user's story.

19
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:16,349
Once we have catalogued those actions, okay,

20
00:01:16,349 --> 00:01:20,220
we can then examine other use cases that involve that same actor.

21
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:27,620
And from the set of activities which that actor under,

22
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:31,870
undergoes in the various use cases, we have built up a set of roles and

23
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:34,570
the combination of that set of roles is in fact going to

24
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:39,290
be what the overall capabilities that that class must provide.

25
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:42,050
So we can synthesize the classes from the set of roles we've

26
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:44,880
defined during this, this process.

27
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,340
I'm not going to go into role-based design any further,

28
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:50,950
but you may come across it in the literature or

29
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:55,180
you may want to look into it more yourself and, and try it out.

30
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:57,860
Because it can be an alternative approach that

31
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:59,380
might be helpful under some circumstance
