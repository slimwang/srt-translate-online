1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:02,632
Two, small, okay, right there I see something I can't.

2
00:00:02,632 --> 00:00:06,012
Oh, by the way, the reason we're using all these slides, my handwriting is

3
00:00:06,012 --> 00:00:09,033
awful, so you're going to be very happy that we have all these slides.

4
00:00:09,033 --> 00:00:09,826
So that's two.

5
00:00:09,826 --> 00:00:12,171
Let's see, I guess the eight is over here.

6
00:00:12,171 --> 00:00:17,490
The 32, yeah, I guess the one on the top left is less, and 64 is there.

7
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:18,750
Okay, I passed my quiz.

8
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:19,670
I hope you did too.
