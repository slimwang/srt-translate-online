00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:01,240
Thanks, Sarah.

2
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:03,900
Now, I'm here in the forest because
everything I'm about to do can be

3
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:05,540
done completely offline.

4
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:07,480
I'm going to take a closer
look at how Git works and

5
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:09,650
how you can use it to view
the history of a file.

6
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:12,750
Specifically, I'll take a look at
game.js which contains the code from

7
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:14,080
the Asteroids game you saw earlier.

8
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:18,950
Since I had been using Git to keep track
of changes while writing this code,

9
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:23,630
I can navigate to the directory where
the code is saved and type git log.

10
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:25,840
What I get is every commit
that's ever been made,

11
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,450
starting with the most recent.

12
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:32,150
Notice how each commit has an ID,
an author, a date, and

13
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:33,980
a message associated with it.

14
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:37,380
For now I want you to focus on
the commit message and the ID.

15
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:40,830
The message explains what has
changed since the last commit.

16
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:43,820
And the ID is sort of
like a serial number.

17
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:47,190
It uniquely identifies each commit and
lets you refer to it.

18
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:49,240
I'll scroll a bit by
pressing the down arrow so

19
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:52,370
you can see the commits with
the changes we discussed earlier.

20
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:55,610
This commit is where I switched
the control keys to use space for

21
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:57,370
movement instead of up arrow.

22
00:00:57,370 --> 00:00:59,500
This one is where I fixed the typo.

23
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:02,680
And this one is where I reverted
the controls back to the way they

24
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:05,470
were before since I didn't
like the new controls.

25
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:07,680
Scrolling back up to
the more recent commits,

26
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,680
you can see some commits by Doug doing
things like making a iPad version of

27
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,760
the game, and there's also a commit by
me adding some color into the game to

28
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,950
make it look more interesting.

29
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:20,970
I can check what changes a commit
introduced by using the git

30
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:22,340
diff command.

31
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:26,480
Git diff is similar to the FC or diff
program you used earlier, but instead of

32
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:31,320
just comparing two files, it can compare
different versions of a file within git.

33
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,170
Right now I'm going to

34
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:35,250
use git diff to see the difference
between these two commits.

35
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:38,320
So first I'll copy the first
commit ID that I want, and

36
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:41,760
then I'll copy the second and
paste them both into my command here.

37
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:46,320
When I hit enter, I see the changes
made between the two commits.

38
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,685
If you are using macro linux,

39
00:01:47,685 --> 00:01:50,930
this output looks very similar
to the diff output earlier.

40
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:54,170
All you need to notice in these lines
is that we're comparing two versions of

41
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:57,810
the file game.js and
here's the actual diff.

42
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:01,020
You'll notice that git supports
the nice feature of colorized diff.

43
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:03,910
So the black lines didn't change.

44
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:06,490
The red lines with the minus
sign were removed,

45
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:08,970
meaning they only existed
in the first version.

46
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:11,420
And the green lines with
the plus sign were added,

47
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:13,960
meaning they only existed
in the second version.

48
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,740
These changes should look familiar
since they're the same changes you

49
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:17,890
looked at before.

50
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:19,170
Here's the typo you found.
