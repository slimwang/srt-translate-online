00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,800
So here's a quiz just to sort of keep you on your toes, or

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:05,040
at least to keep you mildly awake.

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,870
If noise is just a function added to an image,

4
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:12,520
we could remove the noise by subtracting that noise again.

5
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:15,290
That is, the operation's reversible, okay?

6
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:18,584
A, true, yeah, we could do that.

7
00:00:18,584 --> 00:00:21,982
B, true because we don't know the noise function so

8
00:00:21,982 --> 00:00:24,850
we wouldn't know what function to remove.

9
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:28,190
C, false.

10
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:32,170
When you put noise into something, it destroys information in the image and

11
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:33,660
there is no way to recover it.
