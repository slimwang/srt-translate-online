00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,515
What we've seen so far, is capable of dealing with simple,

2
00:00:03,515 --> 00:00:08,430
one-level architectures. However, humans deal with complexity using divide and

3
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:10,550
conquer, breaking things into smaller pieces and

4
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:15,300
then trying to put them together somehow. For software architecture descriptions

5
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:20,492
there are 2 kinds of such Decompositions, Horizontal and Vertical.

6
00:00:20,492 --> 00:00:25,040
Horizontal de, Decompositions are done at the same level of abstraction.

7
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:29,280
We understand the human body in terms of its digestive, respiratory, immune and

8
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:34,140
so on systems. However, we can also decompose vertically by going deeper into

9
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:37,760
the abstraction hierarchy, that is we understand the respiratory system in

10
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:42,620
terms of Lungs, Trachea, Diaphragm. The Lungs in terms of Alveoli and

11
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:46,910
gas transfer for example. We have already seen how, Acme deals with

12
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:50,150
Horizontal Decomposition in terms of components like connectors and

13
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:53,920
so on. now let's look at it's support for Vertical Decomposition.
