1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:04,860
I grew up not seeing particularly well,
and I didn't know that I wasn't seeing

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:08,380
very well, but what I did know was
I wasn't doing well at school.

3
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:11,060
I got my first pair of glasses and
suddenly the world changed and I could

4
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:15,310
start to see the board at school,
I started to do well in my exams.

5
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:18,390
If my situation were different
this may have never happened.

6
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:22,085
I wanted to make sure that that
wasn't the case for anyone else.

7
00:00:22,085 --> 00:00:25,430
Peak Vsion was owner of a challenge.

8
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:29,040
People who can provide eye care tend
to live in cities and towns and

9
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:32,409
people who are blind tend to live in
very rural difficult to reach areas,

10
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:34,140
particularly in low income
countries such as Kenya.

11
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:38,840
And so the real vision was to try and
connect the two using mobile technology.

12
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:41,968
Initially, we moved out to
Kenya to do some research,

13
00:00:41,968 --> 00:00:44,150
which was setting up 100 clinics.

14
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:47,542
I looked at all of the stuff that I was
having to cut around in this eye clinic,

15
00:00:47,542 --> 00:00:49,665
which is over $150,000 worth of care.

16
00:00:49,665 --> 00:00:51,344
I thought can we try and

17
00:00:51,344 --> 00:00:57,325
transform this into a technology
that's really portable and accessible.

18
00:00:57,325 --> 00:01:00,895
So we went about redesigning every one
of the tests that were in the clinic

19
00:01:00,895 --> 00:01:02,025
with either a small phone app or

20
00:01:02,025 --> 00:01:05,865
piece of clip of hardware that
could sit on the small phone, and

21
00:01:05,865 --> 00:01:09,665
allow it to be all performed on
a smart phone by a technician, so

22
00:01:09,665 --> 00:01:14,260
without having to have expert healthcare
training using a configuration of

23
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:18,270
lenses and all sorts of complexities
that would make it possible to hold your

24
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:21,074
smart phone up, point it at someone's
eye, and get a view of the retina.

25
00:01:21,074 --> 00:01:23,950
So we have a suite of
Peak applications here,

26
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:26,300
I'm going to show you the vision test.

27
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:29,440
So what we do here is, it'll give us
some on-screen instructions to stand

28
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:32,780
two meters from the patient, and
they'll get a letter E to look at.

29
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:36,300
They'll point in the direction of the E,
so this way it's going like that, so

30
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:38,310
we swipe on the phone accordingly.

31
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:41,930
Now the advantage here is the tester
doesn't need to see what's going on on

32
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:45,290
the screen, so they're just going to
swipe whichever way the patient is

33
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:47,990
pointing, even if they're giving
the right or wrong answer.

34
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,180
If they were to shake their head and

35
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:53,780
say they can't see, we can just shake
the device, now recorder not seen.

36
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:57,305
And once the test is finished I get a
vibration alert and a reading on screen.

37
00:01:57,305 --> 00:02:01,630
And so what we can do is then view
their world based on our vision test

38
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:06,310
using our sight sim application,
which gives you the detected vision and

39
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:10,570
the normal vision, and it allows you
to walk around that person's visual

40
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:13,920
world and really understand
their level of sight impairment.

41
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,370
The initial build of this were

42
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:20,070
designed to be used within the study
that I had moved to Kenya for,

43
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:23,910
but one of the big things that we learn
if you create a tool that's easy to use,

44
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:28,446
it's low cost and is intuitive,
it's likely to be adopted in any market.

45
00:02:28,446 --> 00:02:35,100
We often focus on impact in terms
of economics in the sense of,

46
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:39,250
how can I make money, or how can
we take money out of this, whereas

47
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:43,460
there's a huge economic value in terms
of giving somebody their sight back.

48
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:47,280
What we repeatedly saw in our clinics
in Kenya, is we'd have young children

49
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,870
supporting old parents or grandparents
who should've been in school.

50
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:53,970
So for that child it means they're
like to never break out poverty.

51
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:57,400
So moving the measure away from,
what can I take out of this,

52
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:02,954
to what could I put in, is a real way of
actually assessing the economic impact.

53
00:03:02,954 --> 00:03:08,130
Then there's a huge number of areas
where mobile developers can add value.

54
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:11,748
I think it's almost limitless in terms
of the way we could improve things.

55
00:03:11,748 --> 00:03:17,190
And by being able to contribute to
making other people's lives easier or

56
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:21,990
more efficient, you can then have
a huge knock-on effect on hundreds,

57
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:23,650
thousands, millions of other people.
