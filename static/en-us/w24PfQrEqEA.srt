00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,580
Remember how the Google repository
provided access to a number of

2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:06,520
Google services, but
in order to use them we needed to

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:11,320
be certain that the user's device
had the STK up to date and enabled.

4
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:14,100
You want to check that this is true
before attempting to make a call to

5
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:15,450
any Google services.

6
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:19,290
And more importantly you want
to build in graceful failures.

7
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:22,200
So do you recall how when we were
learning Google Cloud Messaging I

8
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,960
mentioned that there were two
approaches to doing this check?

9
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,190
For GCM we check if the SDK is available
when the app activity is created.

10
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:32,070
And if so,
we register to receive messages.

11
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:33,740
But if this registration doesn't happen,

12
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:35,870
the user never gets
a severe weather alert.

13
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:39,620
But they also never know that they
are missing out on the feature.

14
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:42,560
The other approach was to
perform the check at the moment

15
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,710
when you are about to make the API call.

16
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:47,140
And this could allow you to display
different layouts depending on

17
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:48,810
the results of that call.

18
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:52,610
And that is just what we want to do for
the place's API integration.

19
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:55,820
Ideally, a user should not even know
that they may be missing out on

20
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:56,950
the place picker.

21
00:00:56,950 --> 00:00:59,240
That means that we need
to structure our UI so

22
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:02,420
this features only appears
to users who can use it.

23
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:06,170
So, let's take at how we can build
our location preference dynamically.
