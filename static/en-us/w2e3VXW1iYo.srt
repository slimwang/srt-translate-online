00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,590
The Udacity and Twitter Course Real-Time Analytics with Apache Storm

2
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:06,920
is considered a T-shaped course because we touch on a number of

3
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:09,820
different topics and go in depth in Storm.

4
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:13,820
We use the virtualization technology Vagrant Cloud and Virtual Box.

5
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:17,040
And using git and Vagrant commands we launch a virtual machine,

6
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:20,030
the open-source Linux distribution Ubuntu.

7
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:24,500
We then use the Java build tool Maven to explore real-time analytics with

8
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:25,750
Apache Storm.

9
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:28,710
We also use the programming languages Python and Java.

10
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:30,380
Along with packages Beautiful Soup and

11
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:35,159
lettuce, and I'm not making that up, to connect to the Python microserver Flask.

12
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:39,399
And the in-memory key-value store Redis to

13
00:00:39,399 --> 00:00:45,520
finally drive real-time visualizations using D3 written in JavaScript.

14
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,510
In Storm, we'll explore concepts like a spout, a bolt, and

15
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:51,210
a connection called a topology.

16
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:54,390
We explore these components written in both Java and Python.

17
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:59,600
And finally connect to the Twitter sample stream using the open API Twitter4J.

18
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,210
We then explore more complex topologies using streaming joins.

19
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:06,300
And finally, you'll work on your own final project ideas as you

20
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:10,320
watch our students work through a hackathon here at Udacity.

21
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,260
Also, since we can't cover everything, some of the topics we don't cover

22
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:17,555
include the programming language Clojure which most of Storm is written in,

23
00:01:17,555 --> 00:01:22,085
an actual cluster administration to submit your Storm topology to.

24
00:01:22,085 --> 00:01:25,460
. And finally, ack which allows at least once processing.

25
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:27,260
Finally, after you're done with this course or

26
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:30,160
even as you're working through this course, you'll be happy to know that

27
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:35,060
Udacity has courses that cover Ubuntu, git, Python, Java, D3, and JavaScript.

28
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:38,810
Let's get started in Real-Time Analytics with Apache Storm.
