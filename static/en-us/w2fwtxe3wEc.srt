1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:01,660
Let's go back into Unity.

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:07,627
Okay, go to File &gt; New Scene.

3
00:00:07,627 --> 00:00:09,320
Great.

4
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:11,850
Now look in the course notes below for

5
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:16,050
a link to the Udacity modern
apartment Unity package file.

6
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:17,435
And download it.

7
00:00:17,435 --> 00:00:22,208
After you've downloaded it, locate
the Unity package file on your computer.

8
00:00:22,208 --> 00:00:23,540
And double click it to open it.

9
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:28,680
Go ahead and
import all the files into your package.

10
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:33,620
Cool, now we have lots of
new stuff to play with.

11
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:38,406
In the Project pane go to
Udacity Modern Apartment &gt;

12
00:00:38,406 --> 00:00:41,900
Scenes &gt; Udacity Modern Apartment.

13
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:44,670
Double click the scene to load it.

14
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:50,130
It may take a moment, but soon you'll
see a nicely lit modern apartment scene.

15
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:54,248
Cool..
Now let's find a model called

16
00:00:54,248 --> 00:00:55,559
Udacity Icon.

17
00:00:55,559 --> 00:01:01,248
In the Project pane go to
Udacity Modern Apartment

18
00:01:01,248 --> 00:01:05,047
&gt; Art &gt; Models &gt; Udacity Icon.

19
00:01:05,047 --> 00:01:07,690
And then you should see
a model called Udacity Icon.

20
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:11,050
Go ahead and
drag that into the hierarchy.

21
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:14,210
Now take a look at the apartment.

22
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:18,070
See the Udacity logo hiding
underneath the table?

23
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:21,343
Let's move it somewhere
nicer inside the apartment.

24
00:01:21,343 --> 00:01:25,017
[BLANK_AUDIO]

25
00:01:25,017 --> 00:01:26,590
That looks much better.

26
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,440
That's all there is to it.

27
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:33,440
Now you've seen just how easy it is
to bring objects into your 3D scene

28
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,030
using Unity.
