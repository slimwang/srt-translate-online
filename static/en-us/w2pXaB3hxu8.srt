1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,539
The shorter leg is 20 meters long, the longer leg is 21 meters, and the

2
00:00:04,539 --> 00:00:10,782
hypotenuse is 29 meters. Great work if you found all three. Now, the setup

3
00:00:10,782 --> 00:00:13,680
might have been tough, so if you got stuck there, watch part of the solution,

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:18,360
and then pause it and see if you can continue solving. To start setting up this

5
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:23,744
problem, we'll let x be the shortest side of our right triangle. We do this

6
00:00:23,744 --> 00:00:26,924
since we know the longer leg of the right triangle is 1 meter more than the

7
00:00:26,924 --> 00:00:33,546
shorter leg. So, we know this longer leg has to be X plus 1. And now here's

8
00:00:33,546 --> 00:00:38,317
where we want to be careful. We know the hypotenuse is 8 meters longer than the

9
00:00:38,317 --> 00:00:43,505
longer leg. So, we'll take the length of the longer leg, X plus 1, and we'll

10
00:00:43,505 --> 00:00:50,043
add on 8 meters. So, the entire length of our hypotenuse Is x plus 1 plus 8, or

11
00:00:50,043 --> 00:00:55,061
just x plus 9. Now we have expressions for each side of our right triangle, and

12
00:00:55,061 --> 00:01:00,510
we can use the Pythagorean Theorem to solve. We square x, which is one of the

13
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:05,764
legs, and x plus 1, the other leg. This gives us these two expressions and then

14
00:01:05,764 --> 00:01:09,092
we square by hypotenuse x plus 9, to get this expression on the right hand side

15
00:01:09,092 --> 00:01:14,140
of our equation. We combine the light terms here to get 2x squared and the rest

16
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:19,520
of our equation remains the same. Next we subtract each of these terms from

17
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:24,142
both sides of the equation. So we have 0 on the right, and x squared minus 16 x

18
00:01:24,142 --> 00:01:31,062
minus 80 on the left. Next, we factor this expression to get x minus 20, times

19
00:01:31,062 --> 00:01:36,268
x plus 4, equals 0. We set each factor equal to 0, which means the solutions

20
00:01:36,268 --> 00:01:39,864
for x could be positive 20 or negative 4, the opposite sign of the factors in

21
00:01:39,864 --> 00:01:45,656
the parentheses. We know a negative side length for x wouldn't make sense in

22
00:01:45,656 --> 00:01:50,350
this case, because we would have negative 4 here. So, this solution is not

23
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:54,661
valid. When we plug in 20 for x in each of these expressions, we'll get our

24
00:01:54,661 --> 00:02:01,553
side links of 20, 21, and 29. With the hypotenuse being the longest one of 29

25
00:02:01,553 --> 00:02:06,349
units. And since our original side links were reported in meters, we report

26
00:02:06,349 --> 00:02:08,419
each of these in meters.
