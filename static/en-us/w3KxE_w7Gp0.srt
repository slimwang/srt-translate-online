1
00:00:00,128 --> 00:00:02,504
Now we’re going to look at a very simplistic model

2
00:00:02,504 --> 00:00:05,091
of a food chain. It’s so simple that we’re only going

3
00:00:05,091 --> 00:00:08,116
to consider two species of fish. One is the predator

4
00:00:08,116 --> 00:00:10,149
and one is its prey. You are going to model the

5
00:00:10,149 --> 00:00:12,323
change of either population the predator and the

6
00:00:12,323 --> 00:00:15,174
prey using differential equations in the form of

7
00:00:15,174 --> 00:00:17,719
these equations right here. It’s up to you to figure

8
00:00:17,719 --> 00:00:19,907
out, however, which of these corresponds to the

9
00:00:19,907 --> 00:00:21,799
predator and which one to the prey. There is

10
00:00:21,799 --> 00:00:23,734
several other features of this situation that must be

11
00:00:23,734 --> 00:00:26,716
taken into account. The prey multiplies at a certain

12
00:00:26,716 --> 00:00:29,433
rate. The prey is consumed by the predator that’s

13
00:00:29,433 --> 00:00:32,002
kind of a given. The predators, however, only die

14
00:00:32,002 --> 00:00:35,134
of old age and the predator’s population also

15
00:00:35,134 --> 00:00:37,928
multiplies depending on the amount of prey that is

16
00:00:37,928 --> 00:00:41,562
present. Now in these equations A, B, C, and D

17
00:00:41,562 --> 00:00:44,729
are constants. And in our program over here, you

18
00:00:44,729 --> 00:00:47,228
are going to fill in their values in this dictionary

19
00:00:47,228 --> 00:00:50,009
called base values. We’ve already provided you

20
00:00:50,009 --> 00:00:52,878
with the values corresponding to two keys in base

21
00:00:52,878 --> 00:00:56,327
values. We’ve included the initial amount of prey

22
00:00:56,327 --> 00:00:58,697
and the initial amount of the predator population

23
00:00:58,697 --> 00:01:00,263
measured in tons.

24
00:01:00,263 --> 00:01:02,189
Here however is some other important information

25
00:01:02,189 --> 00:01:03,768
that you’ll need to know in order to do this

26
00:01:03,768 --> 00:01:07,245
problem. The rate of growth of the prey is 0.5 per

27
00:01:07,245 --> 00:01:10,742
year and the life span of the predator is five year.

28
00:01:10,742 --> 00:01:13,244
In addition, we will reach an equilibrium situation

29
00:01:13,244 --> 00:01:16,242
or a steady state situation with the amount of prey

30
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:19,871
reaches five times and the amount of predator

31
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:22,959
reaches one times. You are going to use this

32
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:25,625
information, a little bit of logic and these equations

33
00:01:25,625 --> 00:01:28,207
to calculate A, B, C, and D.

34
00:01:28,207 --> 00:01:31,360
Once you enter A, B, C, and D into base values,

35
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,595
we’ll move down to look at this function called food

36
00:01:33,595 --> 00:01:37,077
chain. Here you’ll use the familiar forward method

37
00:01:37,077 --> 00:01:39,532
to calculate the future populations of the prey and

38
00:01:39,532 --> 00:01:42,439
the predator at each time step. Lastly, you’ll do a

39
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:45,098
bit of sensitivity analysis. We are going to add in a

40
00:01:45,098 --> 00:01:47,315
degree of uncertainty to this problem to make it a

41
00:01:47,315 --> 00:01:51,081
little bit more complex. Let’s say that A, B, C, and

42
00:01:51,081 --> 00:01:54,949
D as well as the initial amounts of both fish are

43
00:01:54,949 --> 00:01:58,358
uncertain by plus or minus 10%. Similar to your

44
00:01:58,358 --> 00:02:01,081
earlier quiz you are going to create dictionaries for

45
00:02:01,081 --> 00:02:03,391
the minimum and maximum values taking this

46
00:02:03,391 --> 00:02:06,157
uncertainty into account and then determine which

47
00:02:06,157 --> 00:02:08,874
of these six parameters A, B, C, and D and the

48
00:02:08,874 --> 00:02:11,858
two initial values has the largest impact on the

49
00:02:11,858 --> 00:02:14,443
maximum amount of prey. Again, office is very

50
00:02:14,443 --> 00:02:16,959
similar to the quiz insensitivity analysis that you

51
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:18,944
saw on the unit itself. So if you’re having any

52
00:02:18,944 --> 00:02:21,444
trouble, you might want to review that quiz and of

53
00:02:21,444 --> 00:02:23,241
course you can always come to the forums for

54
00:02:23,241 --> 00:02:26,000
more help. Good luck.
