00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
GPS provides us with very accurate velocities, which is nice, but on the other hand,

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
we want to be able to use our system in the tunnel too.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Using a camera with motion analysis is really high tech.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
It's hard to get results that are really reliable in 99% of the cases.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
For experiments, you may actually use a fifth wheel,

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
but in real life this would of course be awkward and costly.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I would say the accelerometer is the way to go. It's just a tiny chip to be added to the electronics.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
One issue about the accelerometer is that it does not output the velocity, it outputs acceleration.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Hopefully, you have a good estimate of the velocity before we start braking and then we can use

10
00:00:43,000 --> 99:59:59,999
the acceleration to estimate the evolutional velocity.
