00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:05,760
The main workhorse of an intent
service is its onHandleIntent method.

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:09,357
Most of the work you will do in
the service is writing the code in this

3
00:00:09,357 --> 00:00:09,881
method.

4
00:00:09,881 --> 00:00:14,160
Now there's a lot to do, so we're going
to break it down into a number of steps.

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,160
The first of these steps is
to get the geofencing data

6
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,450
from the intent that was
passed into the service.

7
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:23,320
This can be achieved using
the geofencing API, so

8
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:25,710
check the documentation for that.

9
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:29,470
The data that you want will be in
an object called geofencing event.

10
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:31,590
Once you've done that,

11
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:36,770
it's good practice to ensure that
the data is good and without any errors.

12
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:38,600
Think about the code for this and

13
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:42,620
write that into your onHandleIntent, and
then check this box when you're done.
