1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,131
So here's the Folk Theorem. Any feasible payoff

2
00:00:03,131 --> 00:00:06,562
profile that strictly dominates the minmax or security

3
00:00:06,562 --> 00:00:08,898
level profile can be realized as a Nash

4
00:00:08,898 --> 00:00:13,690
equilibrium payoff profile, with a sufficiently large discount factor.

5
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:14,380
>> Prove it.

6
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:16,740
>> What we're going to do is we're going to construct a

7
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:19,277
way of behaving where both players are going to play

8
00:00:19,277 --> 00:00:22,980
so that they achieve this feasible profile. And the reason

9
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,730
to make that a Nash equilibrium, what we need to do

10
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:28,800
is make it so that it's a best response. And the

11
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,350
way that we are going to make it a best response is

12
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:34,090
we're going to say do what you're told. Follow, follow your instructions

13
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:37,990
to achieve that feasible payoff. And if you don't, then the

14
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:41,810
other player is going to attack you, is going to adopt

15
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:44,640
a strategy that forces you down to your minmax or security

16
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,090
level, and that's your threat. So the best response to that

17
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:50,770
threat is to just go along and, and and do what

18
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:53,506
you're told to achieve that feasible payoff. The only

19
00:00:53,506 --> 00:00:56,570
way that that's going to be stable though is if the

20
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:58,570
thing that you're asked to do, the feasible payoff, is

21
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:00,960
better than the minmax, right? Because that has to be

22
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,970
a threat. You can't threaten somebody and say, you know,

23
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:05,519
do this or I'm going to give you candy. It's gotta

24
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,380
be do this or I'm going to do, give you something

25
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:09,170
that's less pleasant than what I've asked you to do.

26
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:11,600
>> Okay, that actually makes sense.

27
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,240
>> Yeah, so this is, this is a really cool idea.

28
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:16,210
>> I like it. Hey, could you try saying that again,

29
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:19,060
but with a Southern accent, just the Folk Theorem part?

30
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:20,940
>> Any feasible payoff profile that

31
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:24,640
strictly dominates the minmax/security level profile can

32
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,630
be realized as a Nash equilibrium

33
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:31,810
payoff profile with sufficiently large discount factor.

34
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:37,343
>> I like that because now it's a folksey theorem. [LAUGH]
