1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,100
Now what I'd like to do is show you a bunch of examples on how the change of

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:09,720
just the aperture itself can change the look and feel of an image.

3
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:12,700
We saw that for changes of shutter speed, where we show motion blur and

4
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:13,490
streaks of light.

5
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:18,220
Let's start off with, completely of course, a closed aperture.

6
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:19,430
Of course, I'm showing a white.

7
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:20,910
Doesn't mean it should be completely black.

8
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:22,190
There's no light entered.

9
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:26,390
But let's look at, as soon I open the aperture, what kind of images I get.

10
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:31,392
So this is an opening of f over 3.5, so the end number is 3.5.

11
00:00:31,392 --> 00:00:35,800
These are my three friends again, and actually hopefully you can see this, and

12
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:39,040
we'll be putting these images up for you to look at more carefully, also online.

13
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:42,040
Much more crisper.

14
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:43,690
You can actually see the beard and stuff.

15
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:46,500
But here things start getting blurry.

16
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:50,650
In fact, my dear friend Einstein is almost out of focus here.

17
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:53,540
This effect is also sometimes known as shallow depth of field.

18
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:56,860
And sometimes it's intentionally done by photographers because they want to

19
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:59,950
focus more on the front person, and

20
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:02,180
not actually pay attention to the people behind.

21
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:06,020
So look at this, was here, of course, you can't tell much detail of this one.

22
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:11,560
Let's now start changing the aperture values.

23
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:13,460
I've closed the aperture a little bit.

24
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:15,720
Now we are at a 4.0.

25
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,790
Might be hard to tell but

26
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:21,390
things have gotten a little bit more in focus at the back.

27
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:24,020
Now you should be able to tell a little bit more difference here.

28
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:27,440
again, now we are 5.6, smaller aperture.

29
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:30,240
Here actually you should be able to see a little bit more detail.

30
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,000
We are at f/8.

31
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,780
Much smaller aperture.

32
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:35,990
You can actually start seeing his hair.

33
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:40,241
And Mr. Einstein has gotten a little bit more in focus.

34
00:01:40,241 --> 00:01:42,600
And you can actually start seeing the vase and

35
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,970
all the intricacies of this vase right here.

36
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:49,500
The trees are also getting a little bit more in focus back there.

37
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:53,225
Moving to f/11, increased focus again, smaller aperture.

38
00:01:53,225 --> 00:01:57,536
F/14, now here, you should be able to see a lot more detail.

39
00:01:57,536 --> 00:02:00,403
Getting much and much crisper, and in fact, this is and

40
00:02:00,403 --> 00:02:03,636
this is pretty much the same kinds of crispness and sharpness.

41
00:02:03,636 --> 00:02:07,055
There's a little bit more blur, but let's see what we can do with that next.

42
00:02:07,055 --> 00:02:10,860
But f/18, very small aperture, much more crisper,

43
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:14,590
here you actually can see the vase in more detail.

44
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:17,330
The tree, the leaves are much clearer.

45
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:20,460
And the whole thing seems to be a little bit more full and focused.

46
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:22,500
And there seems to be no, you know,

47
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,870
shallow depth of field kind of stuff back there.

48
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:28,320
Gone, taking it to f/22, much more crisper.

49
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,837
Just to help to visualize this,

50
00:02:29,837 --> 00:02:32,542
I'm going to just show you three different ones here.

51
00:02:32,542 --> 00:02:33,863
3.5.

52
00:02:33,863 --> 00:02:35,530
Very blurry.

53
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:37,400
F/11, less blurry.

54
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,070
Tree is in focus.

55
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:42,230
Just switching back for you to see what it was before.

56
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,770
Forward, let's go one more.

57
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:46,630
F/22.

58
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:47,290
Twice.

59
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:52,022
And of course, less light is coming in, for various reasons.

60
00:02:52,022 --> 00:02:54,770
Yes, we're keeping the shutter open longer, but that's not the point here.

61
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:58,480
The point is, I'm showing the effects just of this kind of stuff.

62
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,920
You see that this is much more in focus.

63
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:03,880
Just looking at it closely again,

64
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:07,690
next to each other, these are the two differences, wider, smaller.
