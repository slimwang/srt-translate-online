1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,791
>> And, in fact, we can simplify this even further by replacing this with a

2
00:00:04,791 --> 00:00:10,381
special symbol and replacing these with something shorter. The symbol we'll use

3
00:00:10,381 --> 00:00:15,102
for sum, is this, sigma. And instead of writing out the whole salary of

4
00:00:15,102 --> 00:00:20,612
Geography majors, we'll just calls this x. And instead of writing out number of

5
00:00:20,612 --> 00:00:26,227
Geography majors, we'll just call this n, for number. So now, we have a really

6
00:00:26,227 --> 00:00:31,953
nice formula for the mean, x bar equals the sum of x divided by n. Isn't that

7
00:00:31,953 --> 00:00:37,693
pretty? Now remember, this is for a sample, and you saw in Lesson 1 that the

8
00:00:37,693 --> 00:00:43,928
sample statistic is denoted by x bar. For a population, we denote it by mu. And

9
00:00:43,928 --> 00:00:49,356
again, we can say it's the sum of x divided by big N, because this is the number

10
00:00:49,356 --> 00:00:55,403
in the entire population, whereas, this is the number in the sample. Now, this

11
00:00:55,403 --> 00:01:01,407
might look Greek to you, well, it is. Sigma is the Greek letter capital S, which

12
00:01:01,407 --> 00:01:06,823
makes sense because it means sum. When you see sigma and then x, this is then

13
00:01:06,823 --> 00:01:12,041
telling you to add everything that comes after the sigma. And actually,

14
00:01:12,041 --> 00:01:19,200
sometimes, there'll be a little i here. And this is going from i equals 1 to n,

15
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:28,020
meaning that we sum x1 plus x2 all the way to xn and then divide by the total

16
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:39,980
number. So, in this case this is x1, this is x2, x3, x4, and x5. And n is 5. So,

17
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:44,648
this is telling us that we sum everything from x1 all the way to xn. Now, don't

18
00:01:44,648 --> 00:01:49,360
be intimidated by these symbols. In fact, I'm hoping that you're going to get

19
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:54,324
more and more comfortable with using symbols throughout the course. So that, by

20
00:01:54,324 --> 00:01:58,769
the end, none of this seems intimidating. The reason I want you to feel

21
00:01:58,769 --> 00:02:03,254
comfortable using symbols is because they're very important and they'll help you

22
00:02:03,254 --> 00:02:07,892
with your mathematical thinking in every class. Symbols are like the alphabet.

23
00:02:07,892 --> 00:02:12,184
The alphabet is basically symbols and we use these symbols to tell a story.

24
00:02:12,185 --> 00:02:16,350
We've used them to learn about people from hundreds of years ago, who have

25
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:20,981
written their thoughts, in these symbols. Now, it's the same with Math. Except,

26
00:02:20,981 --> 00:02:25,458
since Math is a different kind of language, we have different symbols. And Math

27
00:02:25,458 --> 00:02:29,709
is a universal language. These symbols are used across the world, which is

28
00:02:29,709 --> 00:02:33,954
really awesome. Mathematics is a way of thinking, and it has evolved over

29
00:02:33,954 --> 00:02:38,596
thousands of years. And the way we symbolize these thoughts has evolved with it.

30
00:02:38,596 --> 00:02:43,010
This statistical notation is shorthand instructions that tell us what to do.
