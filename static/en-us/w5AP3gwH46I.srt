1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,680
The documentation for Android, it's on
a site called developer.android.com.

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:06,980
It contains a lot of helpful
information, such as code samples,

3
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:08,780
tutorials and articles.

4
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:11,890
You can think of it as an instruction
manual for how to build apps.

5
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:15,970
I use this site daily, and often times
I get to it using a Google search.

6
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:17,180
I'll show you what I mean.

7
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:19,990
Let's look at the documentation for
text view.

8
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:22,370
So I search for textview android.

9
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:26,810
The top link that comes up is
a developer.android.com site, so

10
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:28,240
I click on that.

11
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,180
This is what we call the reference
documentation for TextView.

12
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:35,355
I know there's a lot of information on
this page and it can be overwhelming.

13
00:00:35,355 --> 00:00:37,635
But usually when you're looking
at reference documentation,

14
00:00:37,635 --> 00:00:39,925
you're trying to solve
a specific problem.

15
00:00:39,925 --> 00:00:43,105
So you can actually filter out
all the unnecessary information

16
00:00:43,105 --> 00:00:44,495
that you don't need.

17
00:00:44,495 --> 00:00:48,070
When I come to this page I check
that it is indeed for TextView.

18
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:51,620
I may read the class overview,
and then I can scroll down.

19
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:52,590
This is the interesting part.

20
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:55,280
It lists out the XML attributes.

21
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,410
These are all the possible
XML attributes for TextView.

22
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:03,770
It also includes a nice description on
the right-hand side for what it does.

23
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:06,890
Now you don't need to memorize
all of these attributes.

24
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:09,050
In fact, I haven't used some of them.

25
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:12,810
I usually work with a small subset
of them on a regular basis.

26
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:15,480
But I know that if I ever need
something special, I can always come to

27
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:19,330
the TextView documentation to
find that specific attribute.

28
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:21,020
Here's one that we recognize.

29
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:22,740
Android:textSize.

30
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:26,800
So we click on it, and it links to
the description of this attribute.

31
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,630
It says that this controls
the size of the text.

32
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:32,520
And the recommended dimension type for
text is sp for

33
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,920
scaled pixels, for example, 15sp.

34
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,860
Cool, so we learned this earlier.

35
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:41,120
And if you ever forget you can always
come back to the TextView documentation

36
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,340
and look up what the attribute is.

37
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:47,050
Now say for example I don't
know what the exact name is.

38
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:50,710
In your web browser you can use
the find feature to search the page.

39
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:54,458
The other way to open up this Find
window is to use Cmd+F on Mac, or

40
00:01:54,458 --> 00:01:56,680
Ctrl+F on Windows.

41
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,720
Then I can type in what I'm looking for.

42
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,410
Say, for example, I'm looking for

43
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:04,620
a way to capitalize all
the letters in a TextView.

44
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:09,610
This might be useful for example,
if I'm trying to show tabs like this, or

45
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:12,600
if I'm creating a snack bar
at the bottom of the screen,

46
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,990
like this UNDO text here is in all caps.

47
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:17,040
Buttons are also in all caps.

48
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,340
Going back to the TextView
documentation, I can search for caps.

49
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:24,630
I can browse through all the search
results, but these look pretty good.

50
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:29,074
It says that there's an XML attribute
called android:textAllCaps, and

51
00:02:29,074 --> 00:02:32,970
this description says to
present the text in all caps.

52
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:34,830
If I click on it and
read the description,

53
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:38,420
it sounds like what I'm looking for,
and it says the possible values for

54
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:41,490
this attribute are either true or false.

55
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:43,530
So I can try this out in code now.

56
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:47,610
So going back to the XML Visualizer,
say I have this TextView on screen and

57
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:49,820
I want to change it to be all caps.

58
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:53,102
According to the documentation,
I can add an attribute here that says

59
00:02:53,102 --> 00:02:58,610
android:textAllCaps, and
then I can set it to be true or false.

60
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:02,250
If I set it to true then look,
it's all in caps, cool.

61
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:04,810
The nice thing about this attribute
is that I don't have to go and

62
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:06,240
change the text.

63
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:09,720
Like, oh the possibilities,
and capitalize everything.

64
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,490
Instead I can leave the text as is,
and all I need to

65
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:16,540
do is just toggle this attribute
to change it from true to false.

66
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:18,330
Now, it's your turn to practice.

67
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:22,080
Being able to look at documentation and
then update your code accordingly to try

68
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,530
it out,
is a really useful skill to have.

69
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:27,440
That means you don't have to memorize
everything you could possibly ever want

70
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,820
to do in Android.

71
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:31,860
It's only a Google search away and
you can find it when you need it.

72
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:33,530
So first,
I want you to Google search for

73
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:37,220
textview android to find the reference
documentation for TextView.

74
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:40,980
Then I want you to use the Find feature
in your web browser to search the page

75
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:45,730
for the XML attribute that makes
the TextView text bold or italic.

76
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:49,440
We haven't covered this XML attribute
before, so this is an opportunity for

77
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,080
you to learn it on you own.

78
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:54,040
Once you find something that might work,
go ahead and try to use it.

79
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,960
If that doesn't work
then no problem at all.

80
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,440
Just keep going back to
the documentation until you find the one

81
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,100
that works.
