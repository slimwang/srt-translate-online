1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,740
We assert the correctness of the
reduction with the following theorem.

2
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:05,939
Consider a bipartite graph G and

3
00:00:05,939 --> 00:00:09,780
the associated flow network F,
which we just constructed.

4
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:14,328
The edges in G which have flows of
1 in a maximum flow obtained by

5
00:00:14,328 --> 00:00:20,280
Ford-Fulkerson on F constitute a maximum
matching in the original graph G.

6
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:21,030
To prove this theorem,

7
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:25,530
we start by observing that the flow
across any edge is either 0 or 1.

8
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:28,630
Any augmenting path will have
a bottleneck capacity of 1.

9
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:31,380
Remember all capacities are 1.

10
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:33,920
So we'll always augment flows by 1.

11
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,240
But 1 is also the maximum flow
that can go across any edge.

12
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:41,840
The conservation of flow then
implies that each vertex

13
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,690
is in at most one edge that we return.

14
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:49,900
On the left hand side, we only have
one unit of capacity going in, so

15
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:53,590
we can't have more than one
unit of capacity going out.

16
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:58,510
So each vertex on the left hand side
will be included in at most one edge.

17
00:00:58,510 --> 00:00:59,300
And similarly, for

18
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:03,500
the right hand side, we have,
at most, one unit of flow going out.

19
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:08,340
So we can have, at most, one unit of
flow going in, which implies that every

20
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:13,380
vertex on the right will be involved in,
at most, one matched edge or output.

21
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:18,160
This means that the set of edges
in the original graph that have

22
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:23,120
flow 1 in the flow network
constitute a matching.

23
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,940
Is it a maximum matching?

24
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:26,620
Well, if there were a larger matching,

25
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:30,150
it would be trivial to
construct a larger flow.

26
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:36,070
Just give those edges flow 1 in here,
and connect them with out flow values

27
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:41,072
of 1 to the source, and the one on the
right with flow values of 1 to the sync.

28
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:44,490
So yes, it must be a maximum matching.
