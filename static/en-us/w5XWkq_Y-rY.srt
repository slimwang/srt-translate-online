1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:02,428
Katie has pulled together, from our favorite data set,

2
00:00:02,428 --> 00:00:04,125
information about people's compensation.

3
00:00:04,125 --> 00:00:06,610
So each dot in here is a person.

4
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:10,714
And horizontally graphed is an annual bonus, so this person on the right,

5
00:00:10,714 --> 00:00:14,770
in this year made $8 million, that's 0.8 times 10 to the 7.

6
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:20,900
And over here is a long term bonus that goes all the way to $4 million.

7
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:24,450
And you can see that there's roughly a bit of a correlation between how much

8
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:29,580
money people made in the annual performance bonus in their long term bonuses.

9
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:32,790
We are less concerned about whether this was ethical and

10
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:35,760
much more concerned about running principal component analysis on this data.

11
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:40,498
so, to do this let me test your intuition first.

12
00:00:40,498 --> 00:00:46,149
I'm going to give you for the primary principle component three guesses,

13
00:00:46,149 --> 00:00:49,534
a black guess, a red guess, and a green guess.

14
00:00:49,534 --> 00:00:52,755
And, from what you've learned so far, which one do you think is

15
00:00:52,755 --> 00:00:55,677
going to be the main principal component along which the,

16
00:00:55,677 --> 00:00:57,610
the vast amount of variation the data occurs.

17
00:00:57,610 --> 00:00:58,110
Pick one.
