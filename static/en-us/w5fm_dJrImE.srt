1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,061
So you just learned about the concept of a

2
00:00:02,061 --> 00:00:04,701
probability density and that’s very cool.

3
00:00:04,701 --> 00:00:06,963
You now know what a uniform density is, you’ve

4
00:00:06,963 --> 00:00:09,233
encountered a new type of density that have a

5
00:00:09,233 --> 00:00:11,318
step in the middle and later in this class we

6
00:00:11,318 --> 00:00:13,340
will see densities that are very funny like

7
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:15,571
this one over here called the Gaussian.

8
00:00:15,571 --> 00:00:17,760
We get back to this after we talked about large

9
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,636
numbers and something funky called the

10
00:00:20,636 --> 00:00:24,636
central limit theorem or CLT.
