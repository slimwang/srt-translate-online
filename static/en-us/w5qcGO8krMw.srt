1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
And it's this one. Let me show you.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Here's a typical one, and I apologize the axis over here can't really be read,

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
but you can take with faith that the center is 0.5,

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
and you can see the characteristic bell curve for this simple coin-flipping experiment.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
For this run the mean was 0.50006.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
If I run it again, I get a different sample.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
And there is some randomness involved as this bar over here illustrates,

8
00:00:24,000 --> 99:59:59,999
but over the randomness you can clearly see the bell-shaped curve that flattens off on the sides.
