I think we're really on a roll with this whole finding inverses thing. So lets

2
00:00:03,996 --> 00:00:07,582
just keep it up. In fact, I'd like us to start with the equations that you just

3
00:00:07,582 --> 00:00:11,196
came up with. The ones that were the inverses of the ones we started out in the

4
00:00:11,196 --> 00:00:14,951
last quiz. I'm going to give them new names though. So now I'm going to call

5
00:00:14,951 --> 00:00:20,700
them the functions p, q and r. We have p of x equals x minus 1. q of x equals

6
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:26,598
4x plus 9 and r of x equals the cube root of x. What is the inverse of each of

7
00:00:26,598 --> 00:00:27,819
these functions?
