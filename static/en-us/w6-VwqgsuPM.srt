00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,719
Our store is currently displaying all
the information on the home page, but

2
00:00:03,719 --> 00:00:06,990
marketing needs a way to send
customers to a specific URL for

3
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:10,220
red bricks, one for blue bricks,
and one for green bricks.

4
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:12,710
The cart should also have
its own dedicated page.

5
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:13,890
To complete this quiz,

6
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:17,820
you need to add the UI router module
to the app, then configure the app so

7
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:21,020
that loading each of these URLs
displays the correct template.

8
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:22,870
We currently only have a home link, so

9
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:26,500
you'll also need to add a link to each
of the brick colors and the cart.

10
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:30,060
As a last step, create a nested route
for each brick color that will display

11
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:32,600
the cart if the user clicks
on the view cart link.

12
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,950
A link to this project is
in the instructor notes.

13
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:38,390
When you've completed these steps, the
feedback extension will give you a code.

14
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:39,732
Enter that code on the next page.
