1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,570
The five key data standards are,

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:07,630
the International Classification
of Diseases, ICD.

3
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:11,530
Current Procedural Terminology, CPT.

4
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:16,590
Logical Observation Identifiers Names
and Codes, LOINC.

5
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:18,820
National Drug Code NDC.

6
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:24,110
And Systematized Nomenclature for
Medicine, or SNOMED.

7
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:31,430
ICD and CPT are very widely used because
they're required in most cases for

8
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:33,160
medical billing.

9
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:37,130
CPT and NDC are pretty much US specific.

10
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:43,110
ICD, LOINC, and SNOMED
are internationally used ontologies,

11
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:47,470
capable of representing clinical
relationships among their elements.

12
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:52,290
NDC and CPT are classifications,
although CPT increasingly

13
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:56,480
has sub-codes to provide more details
about a procedure for use in billing.
