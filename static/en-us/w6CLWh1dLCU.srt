1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:02,700
As Dean described, we should let the data speak

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:05,720
to determine variables of interest. There's a tool that we

3
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:08,630
can use to create a number of scatter plots automatically.

4
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:12,376
It's called a scatter plot matrix. In a scatter plot

5
00:00:12,376 --> 00:00:14,928
matrix. There's a grid of scatter plots between every

6
00:00:14,928 --> 00:00:18,730
pair of variables. As we've seen, scatter plots are great,

7
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:21,590
but not necessarily suited for all types of variables. For

8
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:25,430
example, categorical ones. So there are other types of visualizations

9
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:28,350
that can be created instead of scatter plots. Like box plots

10
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:32,400
or histograms when the variables are categorical. Let's produce the scatter plot

11
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,310
matrix for our pseudo Facebook data set. We're going to use the

12
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:38,890
GGally package to do so. So make sure you've installed it and

13
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:41,630
then go ahead and load it using the library command. Now,

14
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:44,840
I'm also going to set the theme here too. Now, there's two other

15
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:47,520
things that we want to do. First we want to set the seed

16
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,500
so we get reproducible results. Now, you might be wondering why we

17
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,770
set the seed in the first place. And it's because

18
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:55,860
we're going to sample from our data set. Our data set contains

19
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:59,730
all these variables and I actually don't want all the variables.

20
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:03,750
I don't want user ID, year joined, or year joined.bucket. So

21
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:05,910
what I can do is subset my data frame and then

22
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:08,900
sample from that sub set. If I check out the variables

23
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:12,230
in my subset data frame these are the ones of interest.

24
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:15,550
Now I didn't use year joined or year joined.bucket, because this

25
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:19,410
one's a categorical variable and really these were derived from tenure. Now

26
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:23,170
I'm ready to use the GG pairs function inside of GGally to

27
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:26,860
create this scatter plot matrix. Now, I've already run this piece of

28
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:29,250
code and I do want to warn you that it takes a long

29
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:32,300
time for this to generate. It might even take over an hour.

30
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,540
Feel free to run the command and if its taking a long

31
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:37,070
time for your plot to generate just come back to your computer

32
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:40,560
at another time. We've also included a pdf of the scatter plot in

33
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,565
the instructor notes so you can check that out as well. Here's

34
00:01:43,565 --> 00:01:46,450
our scatter plot matrix, and notice in the upper part of the

35
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:50,160
matrix we can see the correlation coefficients for the pairs of variables.

36
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:52,900
For age and date of birth year, the correlation is actually negative

37
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:56,040
one. And we can see that on the scatter plot. Sometimes we

38
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:59,250
may want to produce these types of matrices so that way we can

39
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:00,930
produce one number summaries of the

40
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:03,090
different relationships of our variables. This

41
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:06,260
is just like the correlation work that we did in lesson four.

42
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:10,389
So, I've described the plots above the diagonal for the scatter plot matrix, but

43
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:14,220
what do you notice in the lower left of the scatter plot matrix? Write

44
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:17,460
a few sentences about what you see in this next quiz. And pay careful

45
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:21,130
attention to the variable of gender. What types of plots do you think these are?
