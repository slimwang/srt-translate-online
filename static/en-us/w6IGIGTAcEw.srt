1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,170
Student Trupp asks,

2
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:04,610
"What are some of the ethics and responsibilities involved

3
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:05,670
with knowing how to program--

4
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:08,450
and empowering yourself the knowledge of computer science?"

5
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:09,810
>>So, this is a great question

6
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:12,610
and it is something that is very important to think about.

7
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:14,850
I don't know if it was Batman or Spiderman who said this,

8
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:18,120
"With great power, comes great responsibility."

9
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:22,890
>>Spiderman. >> Was it Spiderman? Okay. I'm a little rusty. >> It wasn't him, Alright...>>

10
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:25,260
>>Anyway, it's true, that as you gain more power,

11
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:27,230
and as you learn more about computing,

12
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:29,660
there's a lot of responsibility that goes along with that.

13
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:33,600
And, one concrete example of that I'll give you from building a web crawler--

14
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,040
The web crawler we're building is focused on simplicity.

15
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,470
If you build a web crawler and you run it on the Internet,

16
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:42,940
there's a lot of things that you need to do to be ethical and responsible.

17
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:45,880
One is, every time you encounter a new site

18
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:48,680
the web crawler should look for this file called robots.txt

19
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:51,790
which says whether or not the site wants to be crawled.

20
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:55,490
If you are an ethical web crawler, you don't index a site that says---

21
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:57,760
in the roblox.text "don't crawl this site."

22
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,130
Those things make the web crawler more complicated.

23
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:02,130
Our goal is to understand computer science,

24
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:04,530
and make the web crawler code as simple as possible,

25
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:06,600
so we're not going to do that in our web crawler,

26
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,440
and when you run them on our server--

27
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:11,810
we're not going to allow your web crawler to make arbitrary requests

28
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:13,310
to other sites on the Internet.

29
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:16,840
But certainly, if you run it yourself, these are things that you should worry about,

30
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,910
and make sure to behave responsibly.

31
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:20,550
We're definitely going to talk about this more

32
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:21,680
towards the end of the class.

33
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,000
This will be one of the things that we get in to in unit 7.
