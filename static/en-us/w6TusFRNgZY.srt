00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:03,500
The first anxiety disorder that we're going to to discuss, is generalized

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:08,642
anxiety disorder. This is a common disorder that's characterized by a pervasive

3
00:00:08,642 --> 00:00:13,328
and excessive, hard to control, state of anxiety, or worry, that lasts at least

4
00:00:13,328 --> 00:00:20,153
6 months. People with generalized anxiety disorder, may also have trouble with

5
00:00:20,153 --> 00:00:25,412
sleep. Body restlessness or agitation. Difficulty concentrating or muscle

6
00:00:25,412 --> 00:00:32,189
tension. Adults must exhibit at least three of these symptoms. To receive a

7
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:36,654
diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder. Unlike other anxiety disorders,

8
00:00:36,654 --> 00:00:40,482
people with generalized anxiety disorder often have been anxious their whole

9
00:00:40,482 --> 00:00:44,194
lives, and they can't recall the particular time when they began to feel this

10
00:00:44,194 --> 00:00:50,742
way. These people tend to worry about anything and everything, and their level

11
00:00:50,742 --> 00:00:56,240
of worry is not proportional to the actual threat they're worried about. A pop

12
00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:00,530
culture example of an individual with generalized anxiety disorder is, Woody

13
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:05,674
Allen, the writer, director and comedian. He has said that using film making

14
00:01:05,674 --> 00:01:10,360
and being creative has been a distraction from his pervasive anxiety. Now

15
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:14,840
finally, it's important to remember that feeling anxious towards specific

16
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:20,206
events is totally normal. But, for people with generalized anxiety disorder,

17
00:01:20,206 --> 00:01:24,935
their anxiety can be debilitating. And for some, it may even prevent them from

18
00:01:24,935 --> 00:01:26,760
being able to work.
