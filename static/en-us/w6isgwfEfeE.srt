00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,712
Now for a question to test your understanding of inodes. Suppose that

2
00:00:04,712 --> 00:00:10,232
the disk blocks are of size 4 kilobytes, and that an indirection block

3
00:00:10,232 --> 00:00:14,628
can store 1024 entries. What is the maximum file size that does

4
00:00:14,628 --> 00:00:19,780
not use the double-indirect pointer in the inode? Give your answer in kilobytes.
