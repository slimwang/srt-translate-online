1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:01,673
Hey Charles, how's it goin'?

2
00:00:01,673 --> 00:00:03,800
>> It's going pretty well Michael. How's it going with you?

3
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:04,860
>> Good, thank you.

4
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:07,140
>> Good, good, good. Guess what we're going to talk about today?

5
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:08,750
>> Well, reading off this screen, it looks

6
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:11,360
like maybe ensemble learning, and boosting, whatever that is.

7
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,720
>> Yes, that's exactly what we're

8
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,010
going to talk about. We're going to talk about

9
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:18,650
a class of algorithms called ensemble learners. And I think you will See

10
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:21,310
that they're related to some of the stuff that we've been doing already,

11
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:24,700
and in particular we're going to spend most of our time focusing on, boosting.

12
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:27,350
because boosting is my favorite of the

13
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:29,790
ensemble learning algorithms. So you ready for that?

14
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:30,860
>> Yeah! Let's do it.

15
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:33,470
>> Okay. So, I want to start this out by,

16
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:35,790
going through a little exercise with you. I want you

17
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:38,840
to think about a problem. Okay. And the particular

18
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:41,980
problem I want you to think about is, spam email.

19
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:44,430
>> Mm, I think about that a lot.

20
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:47,980
>> So, normally if we were thinking of this a classification

21
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:51,040
task, right, where we're going to take some email and we're going to decide

22
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53,780
if it's spam or not. Given what we've talked about so

23
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:57,590
far we would be thinking about using a decision tree or

24
00:00:57,590 --> 00:01:01,530
you know neural networks or kNN whatever that means

25
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:03,400
with email. We would be coming up with all of these sort

26
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:06,330
of complicated things. I want to propose an alternative which is

27
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:09,740
going to get us to ensemble learn. OK and here's the alternative.

28
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:12,820
I don't want you to try to think of some complicated

29
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:16,360
Rule that you might come up with that would capture spam email.

30
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:19,420
Instead, I want you to come up with some simple rules

31
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:21,810
that are indicative of spam email. Okay, so let me be

32
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:25,270
specific, Michael. We have this problem with spam email. That is,

33
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:28,910
you you're going to get some email message and you want some computer

34
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:32,170
program To figure out automatically for you if something is a

35
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:35,350
piece of spam or it isn't. And I want you to help

36
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:38,260
write a set of rules that'll help me to figure that

37
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:41,710
out. And I want you to think about simple rules, so can

38
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:45,080
you think of any simple rules that might indicate that something is spam?

39
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,650
>> Alright I can, yeah I can think of some simple rules. I don't think

40
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:55,310
they would be very good, but they might better than nothing. Like If for example

41
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:59,830
it mentions how manly I am, I, I would be, be willing to believe that

42
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:03,780
was a spam message. So like if the body of the message contains the word manly.

43
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:07,690
>> Okay, I like that. like that when body

44
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:09,490
contains manly.

45
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:15,980
I like that rule, because I often get non-spam messages talking about

46
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:19,260
manly. So I guess one man's spam is another man's normal email.

47
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:21,310
>> [LAUGH] I guess that's true.

48
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:23,590
>> Probably. Any other rules?

49
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:27,740
>> Sure if it, you know if it comes from my spouse it's probably not spam.

50
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:31,070
>> OK, so let's see, from spouse.

51
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:34,650
>> Her name's Lisa. Now we're going to call our spouse. So

52
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:37,080
let's say minus, I'm going to go to plus here, so we know

53
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,610
some rules are indicitive of being spam, and some

54
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:42,250
rules are indicitive of not being spam. Okay, anything else?

55
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:48,534
>> Possibly the length of the message. I guess. Like what?

56
00:02:48,534 --> 00:02:50,090
>> I don't know. I don't know that this would be very

57
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:52,180
accurate, but I think some of this, some of the spam I

58
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:54,840
get sometimes is very, very short just like the, it's like the

59
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:58,480
URL. Like hey, check out this site, and then there's a URL.

60
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:02,770
>> Hm, I like that. So, we'll just say short.

61
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:06,070
Just contains URLs. Hm, I like those rules. Let's see if we can

62
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:09,290
think of anything else. Oh, how about this one. It's just an image.

63
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:10,580
>> Hm.

64
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:13,190
>> I get a lot of those where it's just an image.

65
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:15,510
>> I see, like in it's it's and if you

66
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:18,130
look at the picture it's all various pharmaceuticals from Canada.

67
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:20,500
>> Exactly. Here's one I get a lot.

68
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,840
>> Hm,

69
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:28,870
>> Lots of misspelled words that you end up reading as being

70
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:29,540
a real word.

71
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:31,850
>> Hm. But I don't know how I'd write that

72
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:34,380
as a rule. Or you could just list the words.

73
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,930
>> Like rules that, words that have already

74
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:39,320
been modified in that way. I guess so.

75
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,570
>> Yeah, kind of a, kind of a black list, a black list of words.

76
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:45,960
>> Okay so, words like, I would say manly, but you were saying prawn.

77
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:49,110
>> Or whatever that says. yeah, so they're and they're tons

78
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:51,450
of these. Right? I mean, another one that's, that's very popular

79
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:56,610
if you're old enough anyway is this one, remember this one?

80
00:03:56,610 --> 00:04:00,200
>> Oh, sure that was sometimes a virus, right?

81
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:04,900
>> Yes. Our young, our younger viewers will not know this but this was one

82
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:07,670
of the first big spam messages that would

83
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:09,910
get out there. Make money fast. And there's

84
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:13,920
tons and tons of these. We could come up with a bunch of them. Now, here's

85
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,330
something they all kind of have in common,

86
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:18,640
Michael, and you've touched on this all ready.

87
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:23,930
All of them are sort of right. They're useful but no one of them is going to be

88
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:27,340
very good at telling us whether a message has

89
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:31,370
spam on its own. Right. So the word manly is

90
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:33,930
evidence but it's not enough to decide whether something

91
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:37,190
is spam or not. It's from your spouse, it's evidence

92
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:41,390
it's not spam, but sometimes you get messages from

93
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:43,680
your spouse that are in fact spam, because in fact,

94
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,210
she didn't actually send them. You know, and so

95
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:48,310
on and so forth. And sometimes she did email

96
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:51,670
from Princes in Nigeria. I didn't. And they're not

97
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:55,200
always spam. I, I actually do, but any case,

98
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,880
sometimes people are asking you for money, and maybe

99
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,250
that's message you want to ignore, but it isn't

100
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:02,140
necessarily spam. And some people are very interested in

101
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:04,970
getting like this and don't consider it spam, right?

102
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:08,880
>> So, so, okay, so I can see that these would

103
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,300
all maybe provide some evidence, but it seems really hard tp figure out the

104
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:15,290
right way of combining them all together to I don't know, make a decision.

105
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:16,700
>> Right, this is exactly right. And by the

106
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,760
way, if you think about something like decision tree, you

107
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,980
could. There's really a sort of similar problem going on

108
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:22,680
there. We can think of each of the nodes in

109
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,210
a decision tree as being a very simple rule and

110
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:27,840
the decision tree tells us how to combine them. Right?

111
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,550
So, we need to figure out how to do that

112
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:34,200
here and that is the fundamental notion of ensemble learning.

113
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,620
>> But wait, isn't, couldn't you also do something similar with

114
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:39,680
something like neural net. Right? Where each of these now becomes a

115
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,970
feature and we're just trying to learn weights for combining them

116
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:44,770
all together. So That would kind of satisfy what you were talking about.

117
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:48,050
>> True, I mean I think the the difference here in this case and

118
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:49,640
and I think you're absolutely right but

119
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,280
one difference here is that typically with the

120
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,040
new network we've already built the network

121
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,570
itself and the nodes and we're trying

122
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:57,480
to learn the weights whereas in something

123
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,370
like a decision tree you're building up rules

124
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:03,050
as you go along. And typically with ensemble learning you're building up a

125
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:05,880
bunch of rules and combining them together until you got something that's good

126
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,320
enough. But you're absolutely right. You

127
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,170
could think of neural networks as being

128
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:12,180
an ensemble of little parts. Sometimes

129
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:14,130
hard to understand, but an ensemble nonetheless.
