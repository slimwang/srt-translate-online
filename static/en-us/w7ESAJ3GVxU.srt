1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The correct answer is still 3, although you can argue it is more,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
because maybe the position of its steering wheel matters,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
but at first approximation is the same as before.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
There might be a center point for the car.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
It has a certain location in the global coordinate system,

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
and it again has a heading direction in which it can go.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
So 3 is a convenient answer,

8
00:00:20,000 --> 99:59:59,999
although technically the steering wheel angle might also influential for what's happening next.
