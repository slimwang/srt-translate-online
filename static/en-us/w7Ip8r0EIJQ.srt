1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
So linear regression works well

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
if the data is approximately linear,

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
but there are many examples when linear regression performs poorly.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Here's one where we have a

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
curve that is really nonlinear.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
This is an interesting one where we seem to have a linear relationship

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
that is flatter than the linear regression indicates,

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
but there is one outlier.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Because if you are minimizing quadratic error,

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
outliers penalize you over-proportionately.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
So outliers are particularly bad for linear regression.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
And here is a case,

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
where the data clearly suggests

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
a very different phenomena for linear.

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
We have only two ?? variables even being used,

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
and this one has a strong frequency

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
and a strong vertical spread.

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Clearly a linear regression model

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
is a very poor one to explain

20
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
this data over here.

21
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Another problem with linear regression

22
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
is that as you go to infinity in the X space,

23
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
your Ys also become infinite.

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
In some problems that isn't a plausible model.

25
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
For example, if you wish to predict the weather

26
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
anytime into the future,

27
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
it's implausible to assume the further the prediction goes out,

28
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
the hotter or the cooler it becomes.

29
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
For such situations there is a

30
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
model called logistic regression,

31
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
which uses a slightly more complicated

32
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
model than linear regression,

33
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
which goes as follows:.

34
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Let F of XP, or linear function,

35
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
and the output of logistic regression

36
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
is obtained by the following function:

37
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,000
One over one plus exponential of minus F of X.

38
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
So here's a quick quiz for you.

39
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
What is the range in which Z might fall

40
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
given this function over here,

41
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
and ??? the linear function of F or X over here.

42
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Is it zero, one?

43
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Is it minus one, one?

44
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Is it minus one, zero?

45
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Minus two, two?

46
00:02:04,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Or none of the above?
