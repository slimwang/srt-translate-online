1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:02,380
Prototypes come in various forms.

2
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:06,180
Some are paper, some are clickable
screens, some are built using code.

3
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:07,470
No matter the medium,

4
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:10,680
one thing these prototypes have in
common is their intended purpose.

5
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:13,840
The core purpose of a prototype is to
help you communicate the story of your

6
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:17,930
app to your stake holders for
feedback or research sessions.

7
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:21,270
This stops you from wasting time
building a really polished product

8
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:23,410
that has really glaring flaws.

9
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:26,600
Prototyping is not just
specific to the tech industry.

10
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:27,790
Product design companies and

11
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:31,920
car manufacturers have been utilizing
prototypes from the very beginning.

12
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,910
Prototyping is a way to help you
make the best decisions possible

13
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:37,450
around the user experience
of your product.

14
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:40,630
Helps you make key decisions and help
you build better products through moving

15
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:42,640
through various stages,
which we'll talk about later.

16
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:47,560
It's been said that an estimated
50% of engineering time

17
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:50,150
is spent doing rework that
could've been avoided.

18
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:53,350
What's more, fixing an error after
development is up to 100 times

19
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:56,050
as expensive as it would've been before.

20
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:58,750
Customers who have a positive user
experience are going to be more likely

21
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:01,409
to stick with your products and
become your brand advocates.

22
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:05,310
Now let's take a look at the various
stages of prototyping that we'll cover

23
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:05,930
in this course.
