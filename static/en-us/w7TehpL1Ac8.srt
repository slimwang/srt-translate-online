00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,930
The reason why this image is blurry,

2
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:09,090
is because we are simulating our app on iPhone 5S, which has a retina display.

3
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:13,070
Retina display means more pixels and therefore more quality.

4
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:15,960
So what the simulator is looking for, is a 2x image.

5
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:17,660
It's looking for

6
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:23,190
this image right here, which by the way is just two times the size of the 1x.

7
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:25,838
And here I have the same microphone image,

8
00:00:25,838 --> 00:00:29,980
except that its size is 200 by 200 pixels.

9
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:32,930
This is twice as big as the previous image we used.

10
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:36,720
By the way, this image is also available in the instructor notes.

11
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:41,110
So what I'm going to do is drag this image into the 2x.

12
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:42,190
There.

13
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:47,210
All right. I'll go back to Xcode and then stop the project and run it again.

14
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:50,520
Aha, the image isn't blurry anymore.

15
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:53,960
By the way, this form of attention to design detail

16
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:58,140
is extremely important when building apps for the Apple ecosystem.

17
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:01,090
And because it's so important, let's dive a little bit deeper into

18
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:03,000
seeing what's actually going on here behind the scenes.

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,060
The thing to understand here is that

20
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:09,810
the 1x scale factor works with non-retina phones.

21
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:12,942
And these were used in old iPhones, like the iPhone 3G.

22
00:01:12,942 --> 00:01:17,380
The 2x scale factor, however, has a retina screen, and

23
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:20,640
this is used in phones like the iPhone 4 and 5s.

24
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,640
A phone that uses the retina screen in this case means double the number of

25
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:28,680
pixels as compared to a non retina screen.

26
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:32,910
And that is what produces a much better quality for these phones.

27
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:37,600
So when we use an image from 1x in a phone like iPhone 5s,

28
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:43,310
the image looks somewhat blurry as this phone is expecting a 2x image.

29
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:47,040
Now you can imagine that the 3x scale factor is used for

30
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,498
newer phones, phones like the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 plus.

31
00:01:51,498 --> 00:01:53,170
If you want to learn more about this,

32
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:55,860
we've added a couple of helpful links in the instructor notes.
