00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:03,778
So, thanks Lauren. So, you know, another way in which we express emotion is

2
00:00:03,778 --> 00:00:08,555
through our voice. As it turns out, our voice is harder to control than our

3
00:00:08,555 --> 00:00:12,406
face. People can lie with their face more easily, because it's under voluntary

4
00:00:12,406 --> 00:00:16,945
control. But our voice is regulated by the autonomic nervous system. And

5
00:00:16,945 --> 00:00:21,890
remember the autonomic nervous system, we don't control. So, it's harder to

6
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:28,072
manipulate. And for instance, we also have pitch changes with our voice. And

7
00:00:28,072 --> 00:00:32,104
pitch changes might happen when we have voice cracks, when we're nervous or

8
00:00:32,104 --> 00:00:36,526
when we cry. So, two good examples of recognize an emotion in the voice, are

9
00:00:36,526 --> 00:00:41,584
with young children, and when people are speaking foreign languages. So, for

10
00:00:41,584 --> 00:00:44,642
instance, in young children. They may not understand the words, but they

11
00:00:44,642 --> 00:00:49,544
clearly understand the emotional tone. So, for instance, if I parent says, oh,

12
00:00:49,544 --> 00:00:53,838
isn't that sweet versus no. The child may not understand those words, but

13
00:00:53,838 --> 00:00:56,260
clearly understands the emotional tone.
