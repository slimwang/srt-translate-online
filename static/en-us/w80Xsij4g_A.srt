1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:03,120
All right.
Welcome back to Computer Vision.

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,975
Today, we're going to start heading
up the Computer Vision food chain.

3
00:00:06,975 --> 00:00:09,833
We started with basic
images as functions.

4
00:00:09,833 --> 00:00:12,960
We did some image processing,
edge detection, manipulation.

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,556
Then we did some low-level computation
of vision and things like motion,

6
00:00:17,556 --> 00:00:18,083
stereo.

7
00:00:18,083 --> 00:00:21,090
We considered some geometry,
such as things like essential and

8
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:25,210
fundamental matrices that related how
cameras were viewing a scene, panoramas,

9
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:27,150
sift features, et cetera.

10
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:28,917
Even the tracking of objects.

11
00:00:28,917 --> 00:00:32,000
But all of that stuff is
really semantic-free.

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,227
And what I mean by semantic-free is
there was no notion of what the object

13
00:00:36,227 --> 00:00:38,460
was, what you and I would refer to it.

14
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:41,571
So when I look at the table, I see a,
a cup of coffee that I paid way too much

15
00:00:41,571 --> 00:00:43,662
money for
at some really expensive coffee shop,

16
00:00:43,662 --> 00:00:46,125
because that's what we all do
in academia in these days.

17
00:00:46,125 --> 00:00:49,833
But the idea is that I know that,
that thing is a cup of coffee.

18
00:00:49,833 --> 00:00:53,477
So for this section and a little bit
of the discussions going forward,

19
00:00:53,477 --> 00:00:56,030
we're going to be talking
about recognition.

20
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:58,167
Recognition being
the labeling of the object.

21
00:00:58,167 --> 00:01:01,057
In particular,
we typically think of it as

22
00:01:01,057 --> 00:01:04,833
labeling objects with labels
that humans would understand.

23
00:01:04,833 --> 00:01:07,225
The other thing I want to say before
we get in is we're only going to do

24
00:01:07,225 --> 00:01:08,390
a little bit of this.

25
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:09,941
And that's because object re,

26
00:01:09,941 --> 00:01:12,875
recognition has become hugely
driven by machine learning.

27
00:01:12,875 --> 00:01:16,715
Machine learning is a general field
where you have lots of data that

28
00:01:16,715 --> 00:01:21,265
some of which is, is often labeled or
supervised, described what's there.

29
00:01:21,265 --> 00:01:25,184
And you have training data and
you use that to be able to do label or

30
00:01:25,184 --> 00:01:27,833
categorize or
describe some new novel input.

31
00:01:27,833 --> 00:01:31,148
We're going to talk a little bit about
that, but only a little little, because

32
00:01:31,148 --> 00:01:34,208
machine learning is such a big field
that if you want to understand more of

33
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:37,625
the details, you, you almost have to
take an entire machine learning course.

34
00:01:37,625 --> 00:01:40,863
So we'll be touching on the underlying
machine learning methods,

35
00:01:40,863 --> 00:01:42,996
especially a couple lessons from now.

36
00:01:42,996 --> 00:01:46,322
But mostly, we'll try to talk a bit
about how its been applied to

37
00:01:46,322 --> 00:01:47,872
a Computer Vision scenario.
