00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
In lecture we showed that a * b = xy + z.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
We need to solve for z, substituting in values

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
for a = 63, b = 12, x = 20, and y = 12, plus z.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Finishing the rest of the math, we get that z = 516.
