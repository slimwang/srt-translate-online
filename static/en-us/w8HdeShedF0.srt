00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:08,163
Now you've seen IP addresses before
like 50.116.54.191 or 8.8.8.8.

2
00:00:08,163 --> 00:00:12,000
An IP address is used to designate a
particular destination on the Internet,

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,190
typically a particular machine.

4
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:17,040
And every message that travels
over the Internet, a web request,

5
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:19,330
an email, a ping, or what have you.

6
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:23,377
Is split into packets, and every one
of these packets has the IP address of

7
00:00:23,377 --> 00:00:26,134
the machine it came from and
where it's going to.

8
00:00:26,134 --> 00:00:29,504
Now a point about terminology, in this
lesson in the rest of the course,

9
00:00:29,504 --> 00:00:31,830
you'll hear me talk about hosts a lot.

10
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:33,610
A host is just a machine
on the Internet,

11
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:35,854
particularly one that
might host services.

12
00:00:35,854 --> 00:00:39,220
You'll also hear me talk about
the endpoints of a connection,

13
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:40,960
those are just the two machines or

14
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,950
programs that are communicating
over that connection.

15
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:45,880
Okay, let's get started.

16
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:46,510
First off,

17
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:49,370
let's take another look at something
you've definitely seen before, Ping.
