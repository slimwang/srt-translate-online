1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:02,580
My intuition is that this
problem is related to

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:05,060
the PrintSettingsViewController.

3
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:09,000
So before we run the app, let's go to
the PrintSettingsViewController here.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,400
And add a print statement to
the bugTypeSelected method.

5
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:16,100
This is the method that get's called
when any of the bug type buttons

6
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:17,590
are pressed.

7
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:18,660
And I'll rebuild and run.

8
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:23,730
Print debugging > Settings and
select a bug type.

9
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:28,484
And we're still crashing, but from the
debug output, we can see that we're at

10
00:00:28,484 --> 00:00:31,803
least calling the method because our
first print statement is reached and

11
00:00:31,803 --> 00:00:34,050
then something goes wrong.

12
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:36,740
In the crash report, it's saying
that we have a fatal error and

13
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:40,790
then it unexpectedly found nil,
while unwrapping an optional value.

14
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:44,230
If we look at the line
causing the error, line 31,

15
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:46,250
we see that there
are three unwrapped values.

16
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:49,470
One here, here and here.

17
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:52,490
So let's try printing out each of
these before the lines reached.

18
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:57,993
And rebuild and run,
going to stop first.

19
00:00:57,993 --> 00:01:00,254
Build, there we go.

20
00:01:00,254 --> 00:01:04,727
Select the Print Debugging
again > Settings > Select, and

21
00:01:04,727 --> 00:01:06,490
there's our problem.

22
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:10,740
The current title of the button is
Button, and when we try to convert this

23
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:16,290
to an integer in the second print
statement on the two int call, It fails.

24
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:21,513
The behavior that we want is for
each button title to be an integer which

25
00:01:21,513 --> 00:01:27,191
corresponds to a particular bug type,
so let's go to the storyboard here.

26
00:01:27,191 --> 00:01:29,385
And we're looking at
the PrintSettingsViewController.

27
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,580
Let me zoom out a little bit so
that we can see what we are doing.

28
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:34,950
There we go.

29
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:38,480
So hide this and here are our buttons.

30
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:42,140
So these first four are the ones
that we're worried about.

31
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:43,000
Let's change these.

32
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,608
We'll go zero for the first because
it's a zero index bug type.

33
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:53,440
One, two, and three.

34
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:58,260
And we'll rebuild and run, and
let's select a new bug type.

35
00:01:58,260 --> 00:01:59,240
And it looks like it worked.

36
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:02,952
But let's do a quick sanity
check to really make sure.

37
00:02:02,952 --> 00:02:07,383
A sanity check when debugging is a basic
test that'll quickly evaluate whether or

38
00:02:07,383 --> 00:02:09,639
not the program's working as expected.

39
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:13,040
So since we set the bug
type to the blue bug here,

40
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,950
we should be able to create blue bugs.

41
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:17,100
There we go, our first blue spider.

42
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:18,938
Try a different type.

43
00:02:18,938 --> 00:02:20,888
Green.

44
00:02:20,888 --> 00:02:22,548
Red.

45
00:02:22,548 --> 00:02:23,488
Here's red.

46
00:02:23,488 --> 00:02:24,280
And we're good to go.
