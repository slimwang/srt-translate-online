00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:03,550
As we discussed in
the beginning of the lesson,

2
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:08,730
we wanted to introduce you to
the method of building models.

3
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:11,250
The kernel density estimate example

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:15,980
covered one of the most important
concepts behind models.

5
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:19,420
That is to understand
the probability distributions

6
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:21,590
corresponding to processes and
phenomena.

7
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:28,300
We did not go through parametric or
machine learning models in this lesson,

8
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:32,030
hoping you have learned how
to build a regression or

9
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:37,040
mathematical model if you need to
by asking the right questions and

10
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,630
selecting your features well
to answer these questions.

11
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:45,320
The next part of this
process is to validate and

12
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:48,670
verify the results that
we get from our models.

13
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:53,010
We got a little taste of that in
this and the previous lessons.

14
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:57,080
In the next lesson,
we will build classification models.

15
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:01,900
Through that example, you will learn
about testing and validating your

16
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:07,010
models, and ways to select between
models based on performance.
