1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,810
I want you to write
the numLetters function.

2
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:04,520
It needs to take a letter and

3
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:09,520
return a newly created function,
then call that function with a number.

4
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:13,210
This number will be how many times
the letter should be returned.

5
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:18,200
For example if I call numLetters with
the letter a, I'll get a function back.

6
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:22,980
Now if I call LotsOfAaas with the number
4.3, four as will be returned.

00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:27,570
For a tip in writing your constructor
function, it might be helpful to

8
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:31,390
know that you can break up a string
into several lines with a backslash.

9
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:34,620
For example, these two variables
hold the exact same string.

10
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,750
Alternatively, you can concatenate
your strings together.

11
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:41,780
All three of these form the same string,
without any line breaks.
