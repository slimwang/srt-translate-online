1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:04,540
So Quicksilver asked this question, if recoverability

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:08,020
is so critical for so many subsystems,

3
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:11,160
shouldn't recovery be a first class citizen

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:14,080
in the design of operating system and not

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,490
an afterthought? Because LRVM and Riovista are

6
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:20,210
trying to fix a problem that manifested

7
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:22,770
itself because the operating system was doing

8
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:25,710
it's job well. So the question that Quicksilver

9
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:29,180
is asking is. Can we make recovery a first

10
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:31,730
class citizen in the design of the operating system?
