00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:04,356
The solution for x is positive three halves. Nice work if you found this

2
00:00:04,356 --> 00:00:08,432
answer. I really hope you've gained some steam in solving logarithmic

3
00:00:08,432 --> 00:00:14,806
equations. We'll start by multiplying these two arguments together to get the

4
00:00:14,806 --> 00:00:21,528
log base 6 of 2x squared, plus 7x, equals log base 6 of 15. We get this

5
00:00:21,528 --> 00:00:26,694
argument by multiplying x times 2x, which is 2x squared, and x by positive 7,

6
00:00:26,694 --> 00:00:33,408
which is positive 7x. Now we can set these two arguments equal to one another.

7
00:00:33,408 --> 00:00:38,330
We'll subtract 15 from both sides, to get our quadratic set equal to zero.

8
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:43,244
Factoring this quadratic, will have the two factors of 2x minus 3, and x plus

9
00:00:43,244 --> 00:00:49,330
5. We set each factor equal to zero, and then, we solve for the values of x.

10
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:56,102
So, x can equal three halves, or one and a half or x can equal negative 5. We

11
00:00:56,102 --> 00:00:59,740
want to be cautious and make sure these answers check in our original solution.

12
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:04,459
Since we have log base 6 of x, we know that x equals negative 5 will not be a

13
00:01:04,459 --> 00:01:11,246
solution. We can't take the logarithm of a negative number. This solution

14
00:01:11,246 --> 00:01:16,296
doesn't work, so our only answer is x equals three halves.
