1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:02,480
So you just answer the question of what app

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:05,200
do you want to build for your final project? In

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:09,040
this question, you're going to determine in more detail exactly who

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:12,042
you're building this app for. And in the next question,

5
00:00:12,042 --> 00:00:14,950
you'll actually can start the high level flow for

6
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:18,990
this use, but let's stay focused here. So the flow

7
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:22,570
for what you'll do in this question itself. Is first,

8
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:25,535
you'll find a potential user. This could be a friend,

9
00:00:25,535 --> 00:00:29,180
co-worker, family member. Somebody who you think could

10
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:31,850
ever feasibly want to use the app you described

11
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:34,590
here. Then you're actually going to do some very

12
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:40,090
basic user-experience research. This will essentially be an interview

13
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:42,640
with this person you know. We'll try and

14
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,380
figure out the attributes about them as they pertain

15
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:48,798
to the app you want to build. Now doing

16
00:00:48,798 --> 00:00:51,610
this is really hard, user research is not easy.

17
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:54,570
And we've provided a privy template which includes some suggested

18
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:58,130
questions and categories of questions to think about. Once you've

19
00:00:58,130 --> 00:01:01,680
done your user research, you'll actually create a persona in

20
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,730
this case, for the person you interviewed. Again, the template's

21
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:07,530
going to be really helpful for this step. Some really key

22
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:12,590
points when you're thinking about user research. First, be quiet.

23
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:14,380
And by that, I mean the other person should be

24
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:17,790
doing most of the talking. Try not to interrupt and

25
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:21,980
definitely don't ever tell them they're wrong. Second, is to ask open questions.

26
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,590
And by this, I mean, let's say you were to make a music app

27
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:29,430
for this person. You shouldn't ask a question like: how much do you enjoy

28
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:33,580
listening to music in the car? Rather, ask when do you listen to music?
