1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:03,481
We'll use this knowledge of downstream and upstream to help us solve a motion

2
00:00:03,481 --> 00:00:08,182
problem with the current. We know that if we travel downstream we'll end up be

3
00:00:08,182 --> 00:00:12,920
travelling faster since we'll be going with the current. But if we travel

4
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:16,876
upstream we'll have to be going slower since we're going against it. Let's see

5
00:00:16,876 --> 00:00:20,880
if we can solve this first motion problem together. You take a boat upstream

6
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,334
for ten miles, and then back down for 15 miles. If the speed of the current in

7
00:00:25,334 --> 00:00:28,394
the river is five miles per hour, and you make the entire trip in one hour,

8
00:00:28,394 --> 00:00:33,503
let's see if you can find the speed of the boat in still water. Just like all

9
00:00:33,503 --> 00:00:36,736
the motion problems we've encountered up until this point, we want to use a

10
00:00:36,736 --> 00:00:41,609
table to help us organize all this information. So here's my table and we'll

11
00:00:41,609 --> 00:00:45,263
have the distance for the boat upstream, its rate and its time, and the

12
00:00:45,263 --> 00:00:49,358
distance of the boat downstream with that rate and that corresponding time as

13
00:00:49,358 --> 00:00:55,924
well. We want to find the speed of the boat in still water. So, let's make that

14
00:00:55,924 --> 00:01:00,290
be our variable. X is going to be the speed of our boat and in miles per hour.

15
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:04,134
So now that we have a variable what expression can you write for the rate, or

16
00:01:04,134 --> 00:01:07,792
the speed of the boat, moving upstream, and the speed of the boat moving

17
00:01:07,792 --> 00:01:10,335
downstream.
