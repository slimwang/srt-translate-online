A class in ULM or in an object-oriented language, is a description of a similar

2
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:11,640
set of instances. Candidates for classes include domain objects,

3
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:17,020
roles, events, and interactions. In the previous lesson we learned how

4
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:22,720
to use nouns as a way of giving you ideas of what are good candidate classes.

5
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:28,690
In UML a class is denoted by a rectangle that is horizontally partitioned in to

6
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:35,320
three or more units. Actually, all but the first of those units is optional.

7
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:41,440
The particular units which are most commonly used, are the name, the attributes,

8
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,410
and the operations. And we'll be looking at all of those. In addition,

9
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:51,190
if you wish, you could have units that describe responsibilities, exceptions,

10
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:57,670
and so on. Here's and example of a UML class. There are three horizontally

11
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:01,850
partitioned units. The top one features the name of the particular class,

12
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:06,870
in this case it's window, it's the window class. In the middle is an area where

13
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:10,990
the attributes of that class are described. In this case, they're attributes for

14
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:16,280
the size of the window, the visibility, and other features. In the bottom

15
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:21,460
most of the three units is a description of the operations which a window object

16
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:25,230
can provide. In this case it can display, it can hide, and so on.
