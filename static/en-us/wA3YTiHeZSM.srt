1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,950
As you'll remember from the last unit, a decision problem states a problem in a way

2
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:07,450
that the answer is either yes or no.

3
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:10,980
It cannot be the first one, because what is the shortest tour

4
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:13,480
would actually have to specify that tour.

5
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:16,850
It can also not be the third one, because given a graph with distances,

6
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:20,250
how long is the shortest tour, that asks for a number.

7
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:23,220
The only yes/no question is the second one here.

8
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:27,790
In order to state shortest tour as a decision problem, we have the graph wtih distances

9
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:33,460
as an input and a number d, in order to be able to ask if there is a tour of length at most d.

10
00:00:33,460 --> 99:59:59,999
This one here is correct.
