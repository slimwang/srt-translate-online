00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,717
I started to show you over the past few videos, how we can begin with an

2
00:00:03,717 --> 00:00:08,007
equation in the standard form for a parabola, and then transform it so that it's

3
00:00:08,007 --> 00:00:11,972
written in a form where we can read off the coordinates of the vertex right

4
00:00:11,972 --> 00:00:16,312
away. This is a really powerful tool. Since we've learned now how to recognize

5
00:00:16,312 --> 00:00:20,216
the vertex of a parabola from it's graph and also the role that, that vertex

6
00:00:20,216 --> 00:00:24,502
plays in characterizing the equation of the parabola. As we delve more deeply

7
00:00:24,502 --> 00:00:27,922
into how to get equations in this form, we're going to be more and more

8
00:00:27,922 --> 00:00:30,760
successful about recognizing and graphing parabolas.
