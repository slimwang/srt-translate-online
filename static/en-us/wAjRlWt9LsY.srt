Reflecting in the x axis requires replacing y with negative y. Which means

2
00:00:04,821 --> 00:00:09,646
negating the entire function. So I've made the whole right side of the function

3
00:00:09,646 --> 00:00:14,640
negative. Now we could also of course distribute this negative to the two terms

4
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:19,677
that we have. That would give us negative, the quantity x minus1 to the 4th,

5
00:00:19,677 --> 00:00:22,079
plus 1. Either way works.
