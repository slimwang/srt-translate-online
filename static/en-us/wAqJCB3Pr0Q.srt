00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:05,410
In this lesson we will learn about VLIW, and explicitly parallel processors,

2
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:09,280
such as Intel's Itanium. Unlike their out of order cousins,

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:13,760
these processors do not try to identify ILP on their own,

4
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:17,100
instead, they just do what the compiler tells them to do.
