00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,240
That's right. With a touch input type in particular

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:06,670
we can easily get multiple touch move events, inside a

3
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:10,080
single rendering frame refresh. It's pretty silly to try

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,800
to paint the screen multiple times during a single video

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,790
frame. We're just wasting work like we learned about

6
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:18,530
in the last lesson in performance. So, it's even more

7
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:21,540
important when writing touch event handler code. To not

8
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:25,810
actually draw things, inside that touch event handler. But actually,

9
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:27,810
buffer them up and paint them inside a

10
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:30,750
request animation frame handler. Now, you may have

11
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:33,900
noticed, that inside my synthesizer, I'm actually setting

12
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:38,050
classes, which cause CSS refreshers in response to touch

13
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:41,620
messages. This could be a problem, except that

14
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:45,450
setting that class happens relatively infrequently. It only happens

15
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:47,760
when you transition from one key to another.

16
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,870
So ,it's not causing multiple refreshes per paint cycle.

17
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:52,790
Which is what we're, really trying to avoid.
