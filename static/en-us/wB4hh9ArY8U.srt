00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,500
Now let's discuss some
details of the systems and

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:06,530
deployment aspects of
intrusion detection.

3
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:11,200
An IDS typically performs what
we call passive monitoring.

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,580
That is, it is recording and
analyzing data about systems and

5
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:20,430
network activities while these
activities continue to take place.

6
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:24,990
Only when the IDS outputs an alert and
the response policy

7
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:29,300
dictates a direct intervention,
such as blocking a connection or

8
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:32,335
terminating a program,
are the activities affected.
