00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,548
For our last problem, I have the quantity 4 minus 10 squared plus 3 squared,

2
00:00:04,653 --> 00:00:09,604
minus the absolute value of 5 times the quantity negative 4 times 1 plus 2. And

3
00:00:09,616 --> 00:00:14,220
this whole quantity in the brackets is squared. I know this seems like a lot.

4
00:00:14,325 --> 00:00:19,133
But if you work carefully and start from the parenthesis, you can figure this

5
00:00:19,145 --> 00:00:00,000
out. Good luck.
