1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:01,700
As we complete that function,

2
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:05,300
the context moves back out to the global context and we run it again.

3
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:10,380
Running it again creates a second blue context that is distinct from the first.

4
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:15,310
The new deed variable is added to the new context and running the log function,

5
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:19,410
the first line creates a new deed variable that is distinct from the first.

6
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:21,750
And the log function should have a different behavior this time.

7
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:24,030
What would you expect the output to be now?
