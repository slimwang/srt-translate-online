00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,898
Now you're going to take a little true or false quiz that might be a little

2
00:00:03,898 --> 00:00:08,119
tricky, and it'll get you thinking more about the mode. Do you think this is

3
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:12,381
true or false? Can the mode be used to describe any type of data, numerical or

4
00:00:12,381 --> 00:00:17,107
categorical? True or false that all scores in the in the data set affect the

5
00:00:17,107 --> 00:00:21,809
mode. Or, if we have a population, and we take a lot of samples from this

6
00:00:21,809 --> 00:00:27,117
population, and we find the mode in each sample, the mode'll be about the same.

7
00:00:27,117 --> 00:00:32,244
True or false? And finally, there is an equation for the mode. Is that true or

8
00:00:32,244 --> 00:00:32,741
false?
