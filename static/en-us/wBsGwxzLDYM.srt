1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:04,000
Let's say we have an array
representing the contents of a bag.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,410
In Objective-C, arrays are not typed.

3
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:09,660
Instead, every item in
an array is a type ID.

4
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:13,029
That means we can fill up our bag
with all different kinds of objects,

5
00:00:13,029 --> 00:00:13,852
a bowling ball.

6
00:00:13,852 --> 00:00:17,641
[BLANK_AUDIO]

7
00:00:17,641 --> 00:00:18,686
A lamp.

8
00:00:18,686 --> 00:00:23,654
[BLANK_AUDIO]

9
00:00:23,654 --> 00:00:28,414
A string and hey one more lamp.

10
00:00:28,414 --> 00:00:38,477
[BLANK_AUDIO]

11
00:00:38,477 --> 00:00:41,950
Now, let's say we want to randomly
grab an item from our bag.

12
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:44,115
We'll do that by generating
a random number first.

13
00:00:44,115 --> 00:00:45,630
[INAUDIBLE] Now,

14
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:50,510
at compile time, we don't know what
class our mystery item belongs to.

15
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:52,690
It's marked with a type ID.

16
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:55,650
At runtime,
we can get a little more information.

17
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:57,610
If we throw a log statement in there,

18
00:00:57,610 --> 00:01:03,410
we can see in the console that the class
of our mystery item is a lamp.
