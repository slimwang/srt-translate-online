1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Let's improve our myopic model a little.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:10,000
What could these two differential equations stand for that fish of type 1 die,

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
there are young fish and mature fish, and that fish of type 2 are harvested.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 99:59:59,999
For each of these options, pick yes, maybe or no.
