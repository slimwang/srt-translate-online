00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:04,030
One of the reasons that using a pattern
like recycler view is useful,

2
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:06,900
is that it makes it easy
to handle clicks on items.

3
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:10,720
Recycler view doesn't include
any type of click listeners, but

4
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:12,820
it's pretty straight
forward to implement.

5
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:14,285
>> In the last exercise,

6
00:00:14,285 --> 00:00:19,304
recycler view click handling, we need to
make a few changes in the green adapter.

7
00:00:19,304 --> 00:00:23,605
The first step is to create an interface
that will define your listener.

8
00:00:23,605 --> 00:00:26,500
The signature can be
anything you want it to be.

9
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:28,769
Let's call it list item click listener.

10
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:33,359
We only care about the adapter
item index that was clicked

11
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:34,829
which is an integer.

12
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:38,619
So let's give it a method
called on list item click

13
00:00:38,619 --> 00:00:40,669
that takes in an integer as a parameter.

14
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,960
Next we'll add a member
variable to the green adapter,

15
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:49,070
to store a reference to
a list item click listener.

16
00:00:50,109 --> 00:00:54,200
And to initialize that we need to
modify our green adapter constructor.

17
00:00:55,880 --> 00:01:00,679
The constructor needs to take an extra
parameter list item click listener.

18
00:01:00,679 --> 00:01:04,159
This allows us to use the green
adaptor as a component,

19
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:08,629
with an external click handler,
such as from our activity.

20
00:01:08,629 --> 00:01:10,269
So inside our constructor,

21
00:01:10,269 --> 00:01:14,420
we'll initialize the unclick listener
to the past ten listener parameter.

22
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:18,620
Now that the adaptor has
access to a listener,

23
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:22,540
we need to pass it to the view holder so
that the view can invoke it.

24
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:30,620
So we change the number of view holder,
to implement View.OnClickListener.

25
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:34,430
Doing so, means that we need to
override the on click method,

26
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:40,030
set the body of the function to get the
adaptor position, which is the item that

27
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:45,629
was clicked, and then invoke the onClick
listener of the other class.

28
00:01:45,629 --> 00:01:48,799
By passing in the clicked
position value.

29
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,969
Lastly in the green adaptor, you need
to call the set onClick listener,

30
00:01:52,969 --> 00:01:55,750
on itemView in the constructor to this.

31
00:01:56,959 --> 00:02:02,769
Now flipping over to our main activity,
we'll start by adding an nToast member

32
00:02:02,769 --> 00:02:07,780
variable, to allow us to cancel toasts
if the user rapidly clicks on items.

33
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:10,038
We'll see how we'll
use that in a second.

34
00:02:10,038 --> 00:02:13,239
But first we have to have our
main activity to implement

35
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:16,189
our greenAdapter.listItem
click listener,

36
00:02:16,189 --> 00:02:20,689
and by doing that we also have
to implement the function.

37
00:02:20,689 --> 00:02:24,949
And we'll change our green
adaptor constructors to pass in

38
00:02:24,949 --> 00:02:28,419
the parameter this for both cases.

39
00:02:28,419 --> 00:02:32,429
In the previously created
onListItemClick function,

40
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:37,189
we create a toast message using
the clickedItemIndex and show it.

41
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:43,669
If we run the app right now it works,
but if you click a bunch of items,

42
00:02:45,189 --> 00:02:48,469
you would notice that the toast
messages aren't delayed.

43
00:02:48,469 --> 00:02:50,990
That's because they're being queued up.

44
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:55,120
To avoid that, we can check if
the previous test is not null, and if so

45
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,039
we just cancel it, and
then show the new one.

46
00:02:58,039 --> 00:03:00,569
Now you can see that
clicking on the items

47
00:03:00,569 --> 00:03:02,400
refresh the toast message immediately
