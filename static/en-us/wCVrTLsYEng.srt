1
00:00:00,018 --> 00:00:02,083
Now is time to get started programming in Python.

2
00:00:02,083 --> 00:00:04,282
For this class, you don't need to install any software.

3
00:00:04,282 --> 00:00:07,448
You can run your Python programs directly
using the web browser.

4
00:00:07,448 --> 00:00:11,319
After the video finishes, you'll see a window that looks like this that you can use

5
00:00:11,319 --> 00:00:13,643
to write and execute Python code.

6
00:00:13,643 --> 00:00:18,896
In the top part, which we call the editor, you can enter Python code. For example,

7
00:00:18,896 --> 00:00:25,011
we'll enter the code print 3. Print is the Python command that prints something out

8
00:00:25,011 --> 00:00:29,129
after the print we have and expression and the value of that expression is what gets printed.

9
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:31,538
This could be a simple thing like the number 3.

10
00:00:31,538 --> 00:00:34,887
It can also be a more complicated expression, 
doing some arithmetic.

11
00:00:34,887 --> 00:00:36,854
We write our code up here, when we click run...

12
00:00:38,146 --> 00:00:40,811
... it will run the code, we'll see the output.

13
00:00:40,811 --> 00:00:44,102
And here, the first line ran and printed 3.

14
00:00:44,102 --> 00:00:47,807
The second line printed the result of 
this computation which is 101,

15
00:00:47,807 --> 00:00:50,221
if you don't believe me you can try it yourself.

16
00:00:50,221 --> 00:00:53,711
We'll talk lots more about Python expressions soon but I think you actually know enough now

17
00:00:53,711 --> 00:00:57,711
to already be able to write your first program.
So it's time for the first programming quizz.
