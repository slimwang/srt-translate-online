1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
So congratulations, you have now mastered a

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
basic survival course for NP-completeness.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
You have learned about advanced algorithmic techniques

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
such as intelligent search trees, pre-processing,

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
and other advanced techniques such as fixed-parameter tractability

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
that will help you solve and P-complete problems in practice.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Now this material is very deep.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Not many people, at least in my experience,

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
even understand with NP-completeness means,

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
but even fewer people know about these tools and techniques

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
that you can use to poke holes or find loopholes

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
in the laws of NP-completeness.

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
So knowing these techniques and possibly learning more about them

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
can really make you stand out

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
whenever NP-complete problems need to be solved.

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Of course, even though these techniques are very powerful,

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
sometimes it's just not possible in practice to solve an NP-complete problem.

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
As I hope you're expecting by now,

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
we still won't give up.

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Rather, in the next unit,

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
we will see if it helps us when we relax a little bit,

22
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
and instead of looking for the best possible solution,

23
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
are content with solutions that are not quite optimal.

24
00:01:04,000 --> 99:59:59,999
In other words, next time we'll get sloppy.
