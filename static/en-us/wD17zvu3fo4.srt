1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:03,180
DHT or distributed hash table, is an

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:08,090
implementation vehicle for a content distribution network

3
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:10,270
to populate the routing table at the

4
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:14,180
user level. As I mentioned earlier, for placement

5
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:19,550
you need a put operation. And the put operation is going to take 2 parameters, a

6
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:21,530
key, and a value, and the key

7
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:26,230
is some content hash that uniquely identifies something

8
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:29,600
that the user community may be interested in finding.

9
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:32,630
And value is the node ID where the content

10
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:37,120
is stored. And retrieval of a key value is

11
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,070
done using a get operation. And when you do

12
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:42,850
a get and give the key, what you're expecting

13
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:46,350
to get back is the value that is associated

14
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:48,470
with this key value pair. So, what you get

15
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:51,320
back is a value that is associated with this key,

16
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:56,520
which was placed somewhere using the put operation. So using the put and

17
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:01,580
get operation, let's see how to construct the routing table as new content gets

18
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:06,430
generated. That is, you want to do placement of key value pairs using

19
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:09,160
put operations, and retrieval of a value

20
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:11,590
associated with a key, with this construction.
