1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,238
Now, the probability is almost certain that we're going to select a subject less

2
00:00:05,238 --> 00:00:10,400
than this number. In fact, according to our relative frequency distribution,

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:15,211
most of our values are going to be centered around the mean. And remember,

4
00:00:15,211 --> 00:00:20,214
that's the case in a normal distribution. In other distributions it might be

5
00:00:20,214 --> 00:00:24,088
different. Therefore the probability is about .99 or 99%.
