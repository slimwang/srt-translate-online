1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:04,190
Now, that last task may have been a bit harder than the previous ones.

2
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:05,990
This will be our last requirements change,

3
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:09,990
so let's take a few minutes to reflect on the difficulty of this last step.

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,180
I have the same question as I have had before.

5
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:14,982
How hard was this step for you?

6
00:00:14,982 --> 00:00:16,617
How do you feel about your code?

7
00:00:16,617 --> 00:00:19,390
And how many clicks do you think your cats have gotten?

8
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:22,980
Additionally, I'd like you to reflect on your solution for this project.

9
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:24,520
Are you happy with it?

10
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:27,120
Are there problems that you can foresee with it?

11
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,620
What would happen if I asked you for more changes?

12
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:32,409
Does your code feel brittle or flexible?

13
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:34,640
Simple or complicated?

14
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,180
After this reflection, we'll start to get more serious and

15
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:38,770
we'll talk about solutions.

16
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:42,270
I'll reveal how I organized my code for the project, and we'll start

17
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:45,970
moving towards becoming professionals in our code organizational techniques.
