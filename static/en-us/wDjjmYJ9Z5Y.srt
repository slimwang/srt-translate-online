1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:10,910
Let's go in this direction first. We'll have 8.94 minus 11.14 divided by 0.85.

2
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:15,760
Since we're using rounded values, we won't get answers that are very precise.

3
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:21,604
You may have got to negative 2.59 if you round to the hundreths place. But if

4
00:00:21,604 --> 00:00:27,950
we use precise answers without any rounded values, we should get negative 2.58.

5
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:32,976
And then, here, we're just doing the opposite in the numerator. 11.14 minus

6
00:00:32,976 --> 00:00:40,871
8.94 divided by the same thing. Which will give us positive 2.58.
