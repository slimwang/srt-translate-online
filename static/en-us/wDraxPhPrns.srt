00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:03,940
I'd like to introduce you guys to some,

2
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:08,077
it's an online coding, actually,
framework sort of thing.

3
00:00:08,077 --> 00:00:10,840
This is JSFiddle.net.

4
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:15,740
Your Knockout documentation actually
encourages using JSFiddle and

5
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:19,270
just play with all the Knockout
functionality, right?

6
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:20,540
Just to get used to it.

7
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:24,800
So you don't have to start coding your
project right away using Knockout when

8
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,650
you are not too familiar with it.

9
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:30,460
So I understand that you need to get
comfortable with the framework before

10
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:31,060
you go ahead.

11
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:35,710
One of a very basic example that was
given in the Knockout framework,

12
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:39,890
I just personalized it and
saw how I could play around with it.

13
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:46,780
So let me show you, so the first block
that is right here on my left hand side,

14
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:51,060
is the view,
which is your HTML elements.

15
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:58,570
As you can see I have a div that has
two paragraphs and a header element.

16
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:01,305
And then I have my JS code,

17
00:01:01,305 --> 00:01:05,635
JavaScript code right below
that that defines a view model.

18
00:01:05,635 --> 00:01:10,049
And I have a CSS which is on
the right hand side of my screen.

19
00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:16,316
That is just giving a set of
formatting styles for my page.

20
00:01:16,316 --> 00:01:19,319
And whatever you see on the right bottom

21
00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:23,236
is the result that you get
out of coding all of this.

22
00:01:23,236 --> 00:01:29,510
So as you can see i have declared a
paragraph element that has a first name.

23
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:32,650
And another paragraph element
that has the time of the day.

24
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:37,498
And what I've done is,
I've just added a text box input.

25
00:01:37,498 --> 00:01:40,238
So I did input data bind.

26
00:01:40,238 --> 00:01:45,180
Data bind is the variable
that performs data binding

27
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:49,572
with your JavaScript,
with your view model.

28
00:01:49,572 --> 00:01:55,006
Whenever you want to access this
property, you can access using.

29
00:01:55,006 --> 00:01:57,142
>> So basically binding these up again.

30
00:01:57,142 --> 00:01:58,164
>> These bindings, exactly.

31
00:01:58,164 --> 00:02:03,133
You are actually giving my first
name an id called first name.

32
00:02:03,133 --> 00:02:07,173
So here as you can see I've
given value colon first name.

33
00:02:07,173 --> 00:02:10,139
So this can be taught as an id for this.

34
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:14,855
And now if you go and see my view model,
my view model is just a class.

35
00:02:14,855 --> 00:02:19,655
And I'm passing my first name and
time of the day into that.

36
00:02:19,655 --> 00:02:24,185
And what I do is I create
properties inside my view model so

37
00:02:24,185 --> 00:02:26,950
which is called this.FirstName.

38
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:31,050
Which is accessing the firstName
from the paragraph element.

39
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:36,140
And it says equals =
KO.observable of first.

40
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:40,465
So whatever I pass into
the first variable goes into my

41
00:02:40,465 --> 00:02:45,800
this.firstName which automatically
gets updated in the paragraph element.

42
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,690
And there is another one,

43
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:53,520
which is this.time which actually
binds it to time of the day.

44
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:58,668
And it says, track observe
the time of the day input and

45
00:02:58,668 --> 00:03:02,180
assign the value that is
passed inside this class.

46
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:04,600
And here,

47
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:09,660
the next line is very interesting
because it's called ko.computed.

48
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:15,370
So computed is another property that
is very similar to the observables, but

49
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:22,930
what it does is it essentially computes
the values of other observables.

50
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:24,810
And it gives you a result.

51
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:29,790
So as you can see, you have two
observables: time and the first name.

52
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:35,560
What I am doing in greeting is,
I am adding the time and

53
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:41,390
a comma and the first name and then
giving this to the greeting element.

54
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:45,200
So this dom element,
as you can see, is a header too.

55
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,470
And it has the word good in it already.

56
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:53,320
And then you have a span element,
that has the greeting that goes inside,

57
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,930
followed by an exclamation.

58
00:03:56,220 --> 00:04:00,980
And once I finish coding
the ViewModel class,

59
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:06,980
there is a line of code that says,
ko.applyBindings of new ViewModel.

60
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:10,415
So applyBindings is
very important because

61
00:04:10,415 --> 00:04:15,005
this is the line that
actually makes Knockout work.

62
00:04:15,005 --> 00:04:20,160
So if you do not have this line,
your application might not run.

63
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:25,175
A lot of times students
actually miss this part.

64
00:04:25,175 --> 00:04:29,179
So ensure that you do have
the the applied bindings,

65
00:04:29,179 --> 00:04:34,463
which is essentially creating
an instance of your ViewModel class.

66
00:04:34,463 --> 00:04:36,510
And it's passing in information.

67
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:39,800
Here Iâ€™m just passing Poonima and
Morning to it.

68
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:45,620
So when I run this, what you can see is,
it's as good morning Poonima.

69
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:49,440
So it gives me a whole
new message right here.

70
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:55,420
So here as you can see I'm going to
change the first name to Gauril and,

71
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,530
see it's evening here.

72
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:04,570
And then it changes
the message from your view,

73
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:07,250
which is whatever the user sees.

74
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:10,320
So that actually changes
depending on that.

75
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:15,510
I can probably give another
one here as well and try out.

76
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:17,920
I'm going to say Good Night, Gauril.

77
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:23,420
And probably run this application again,
it's going to give Good Night Gauril.

78
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:28,010
So as you can see, you can update
the data from the JavaScript

79
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:31,920
as well as the user point of view and
this is going to change.

80
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:35,690
This is one of Knockout's
very important functionality.

81
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:44,248
So as you can see,
you can actually create any observable

82
00:05:44,248 --> 00:05:49,680
data and
then you can updated on your user view.
