00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,850
As an entrepreneur when you're
looking at your product and

2
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:06,300
you're trying to determine whether
an MVP is good enough, and

3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:09,980
whether you have to reach your product
perfection before you can go out to

4
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:14,480
customers, some of this depends on
what customers you initially go after.

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,460
And as an entrepreneur,
part of being an entrepreneur is

6
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:21,020
maybe selecting the right
customers out of the gate.

7
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:24,540
Can you find customers who are willing
to take something that's not

8
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:27,420
quite finished and
provide valuable feedback?

9
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:30,780
Are they willing to take something and
incorporate it into their business?

10
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:33,150
Those are the first
customers that you want.

11
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:36,170
Because some customers on
the other hand might tell you,

12
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:39,790
we don't want to try this or use it in
our business until it's completely done

13
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:41,580
and it's out in the marketplace.

14
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:43,620
And if those are your
initial set of customers,

15
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:47,110
then the bar is too high
before you can get feedback.

16
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:50,070
And so part of figuring out what that
MVP is, is actually figuring out who

17
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:53,360
your first customers are and selecting
the right set of first customers.
