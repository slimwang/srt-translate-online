00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:02,620
Let's look at how the camera model and

2
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:05,770
the perspective of the camera model is extracted from this.

3
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:08,380
We can actually simplify this a little bit.

4
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:11,510
What I can do is now take the focal length which was on this side and actually

5
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:15,980
just start saying is, okay, let's mirror it on the front side of this too.

6
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:20,010
Which basically means is now I can move the sensor here, and

7
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:24,790
if I move the sensor here I can put the x i and y i values on this side.

8
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:28,240
And one interesting aspect of this simplification is now I

9
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,680
can see the image to be also upright as the object is.

10
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:36,640
Of course you notice that if this object was farther away,

11
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,340
the image would be smaller.

12
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:41,600
If the object was closer, the image would be larger.

13
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,710
And that's exactly what we notice when we were looking at,

14
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:48,650
of course, lenses and how the impact of lenses with moving objects was.

15
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:51,140
Again, this is a idealized version.

16
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:53,150
Pinhole is this point here.

17
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:55,410
We would be replacing this with a lens.

18
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:58,660
We looked at these equations before this is how we would compute the values of

19
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:01,340
both x and y put in each and every object the location of

20
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:04,860
the pixel that would be related to of course where this point is on the scene.
