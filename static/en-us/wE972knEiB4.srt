00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,350
A screen reader actually largely
creates the user interface for

2
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:06,320
the user based on the programatically
expressed semantics.

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:12,030
Instead of a visual UI, the screen
reader provides an auditory interface.

4
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:15,970
You probably noticed in
the previous exercise

5
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:19,570
that the screen reader told you some
information about each element.

6
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:20,541
Roughly speaking,

7
00:00:20,541 --> 00:00:24,035
we can expect some subset of the
following information to be expressed.

8
00:00:24,035 --> 00:00:26,099
What type of element it is?

9
00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:29,940
We call this an elements role.

10
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:33,210
Sometimes a screen reader might
simply state the element's role.

11
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:36,430
Other times it might play
an easily recognizable sound

12
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:38,450
to avoid constant repetition.

13
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:40,100
Sometimes it might do both.

14
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:43,830
The screen reader will announce
an elements name, if it has one.

15
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:47,460
It will announce what its value is,
if it has one.

16
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:50,040
And it will also announce
any information it

17
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,610
has about an element's state.

18
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:56,860
So broadly speaking, if we've done
things right, we can expect to hear

19
00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:01,410
information about an element's role,
name, state, and value.
