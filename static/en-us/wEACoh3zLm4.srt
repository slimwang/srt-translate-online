[Sebastian:] Welcome to Unit 6 in CS373: Programming a Robotic Car.

2
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:10,974
This is the final unit focused on putting it all together.

3
00:00:10,974 --> 00:00:12,970
Let's now review some of the things you've learned.

4
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:16,490
You learned about localization, tracking, planning, and control.

5
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:24,640
And you also learned about probabilities, so-called filters, you learned about A*, dynamic programming (DP),

6
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:30,330
and about PID control. This is a lot of stuff, and you implemented quite a bit.

7
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:39,730
So today, we take all those pieces, and we put them together to build a true, robotic, self-driving car.

8
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:41,770
Let's start with localizing.
