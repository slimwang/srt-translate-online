1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So the code you had to write was pretty straight forward.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Like most decorators, we compute the result here by applying the function to the args,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
then we return the result down here.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Maybe a little bit tricky is what's in this finally clause,

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
which is we're decreasing the trace level.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
So the indentation level goes up by 1 every time we enter a new function

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
and down by 1 every time we go back.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
The issue here is, we want to make sure that we do decrement this.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
If we increment this once, and then calling the function results in an error,

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
and we get thrown out of that error, we want to make sure we put it back where it belongs.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
We don't want to mess with something and then not restore it.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So that's why we put this in a try finally.
