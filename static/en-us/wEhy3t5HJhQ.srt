00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,510
Let's take a closer look at that
some of strings function definition.

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:05,870
Function definitions
take the general form.

3
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:06,946
We start with the func

4
00:00:06,946 --> 00:00:11,506
[MUSIC]

5
00:00:11,506 --> 00:00:13,850
Oops not that funk.

6
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:18,130
So func followed by the function
name then a pair of parenthesis,

7
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:20,710
inside the parentheses,
you'll find the parameters.

8
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:24,630
Taking the form, parameter name,
colon, parameter type.

9
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:26,930
Then an arrow pointing
to the return type.

10
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:30,500
Followed by the executable
statements between curly braces.

11
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,570
So if we look at our
sum of strings method,

12
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:35,860
we see that it takes in a parameter
called a bunch of strings.

13
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:39,310
That parameter's of type array,
holding items of type string,

14
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:42,330
and this function returns
an object of type int.

15
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:43,790
Let's look at another example.

16
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:45,620
You've also seen this code before.

17
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:47,850
The name of this function
is reversedString.

18
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:51,880
It takes in the string as a parameter,
a parameter named a stringToReverse and

19
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:54,240
it returns an object of type string.

20
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:57,230
Keep in mind that not every
function returns an object.

21
00:00:57,230 --> 00:01:01,410
For example, if reversedString printed
out its result instead of returning it,

22
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:04,690
the function signature would look
like this no return type, and

23
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:06,640
since there's no return type,
no arrow either.
