1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:03,780
Another way that we can look at
risk in this thought experiment

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:08,440
is to consider the standard deviation
of all those individual bets.

3
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:12,980
So again consider we have a thousand
different betting tables out there, and

4
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:15,630
we have the opportunity to
allocate our bets however we like.

5
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:20,222
We could put 200 tokens on one table,
5 on another, and so on.

6
00:00:20,222 --> 00:00:24,537
We're looking at the two extreme cases
here of course, but in any case,

7
00:00:24,537 --> 00:00:29,180
what is the standard deviation of the
results of all those individual bet?.

8
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:31,870
So we're going to look at standard
deviation after the fact,

9
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:34,530
in other words,
we're going to assume we bet already and

10
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:36,330
we're looking at the outcome.

11
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:41,590
So if we have one token per table we
might have a loss of one token on

12
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:46,640
one table, a gain on another,
another loss, and a gain, and

13
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:51,615
a gain and so on,
all the way across our 1,000 tables.

14
00:00:51,615 --> 00:00:54,740
Now, we don't actually have to spend
much time doing the math here.

15
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:57,410
It turns out that
the standard deviation for

16
00:00:57,410 --> 00:01:00,010
this case is pretty easy to calculate.

17
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:03,112
Because for each table,
the result is either -1 or 1.

18
00:01:03,112 --> 00:01:06,510
And it turns out that the standard
deviation in this case

19
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:08,190
is easily calculated as 1.0.

20
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:13,020
So it doesn't matter what
the particular outcome turns out to be.

21
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:16,350
We know we're either going to lose 1 or
gain 1 at every single table.

22
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:19,730
And so our expected standard
deviation there is 1.

23
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:20,930
The outcome for

24
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:25,210
the second scenario where we make
one bet with a 1000 tokens and then

25
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:29,770
essentially 0 bets on the other tables,
turns out a little bit differently.

26
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:33,390
So on this first table
where we bet 1000 tokens,

27
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:38,100
we either win 1000 or we lose 1000.

28
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:43,000
And on all the other tables,
the outcome is exactly 0.

29
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,190
Same for this case where
we lost on that first one.

30
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:50,190
So again,
we bet on one table 1,000 tokens, and

31
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:52,770
we bet 0 tokens on the other 999.

32
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:57,160
Reasoning it out this way enables us
to calculate the standard deviation.

33
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:00,000
Whichever way it goes whether we win or
lose,

34
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,910
the standard deviation on
this event is the same.

35
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:06,650
And the answer is 31.62.

36
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:12,540
Key point here is, the standard
deviation or risk is much, much larger.

37
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:15,210
Well as you can see
about 31 time larger,

38
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:19,190
when we make that single bet on one
table and no bets on the other tables.
