To finish our little tutorial on projective geometry,

2
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:06,740
talk about something that's really more of a vocabulary issue.

3
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:09,800
There's this notion of Ideal points and ideal lines.

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,950
So, Ideal points come this way.

5
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:20,150
We said that points are the intersection of a ray from the origin,

6
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:22,090
hitting the image plane.

7
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:23,520
Okay, fine no problem.

8
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:27,650
And all the rays will hit that plane, unless what.

9
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:31,590
Unless the ray is parallel to the image plane.

10
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:36,470
The ray is parallel to the image plane, where does it intersect the image plane?

11
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:41,460
We answered this before we said you had to go, they intersect out in infinity,

12
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:46,360
remember you had to go ask somebody high in the Himalayas about why that's true?

13
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:46,990
That's the second time,

14
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:50,250
that joke was so good the first time I thought I'd use it a second time.

15
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:53,000
Anyway, but the idea is that this notion of an ideal point is

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,280
essentially a point in infinity.

17
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:59,520
And the way you get a point in infinity is that you have z, the, the,

18
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,019
the last term is x, y, 0, scale being 0, gives you a point at infinity.

19
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:07,310
And if you want to think about that, what happens when you divide by zero, x and

20
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:09,940
y blow up, and, and they go to infinity.

21
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:13,130
So that's an ideal point, and the problem with an ideal point is that the ray

22
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:15,920
that's supposed to define it is parallel to the image plane.

23
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,390
Well, what about a line, where the normal

24
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:25,230
that defines the plane is parallel to the image plane, and that's shown here.

25
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:29,500
It's a little difficult to see but here's our normal, right here.

26
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:32,400
And you'll notice it has a z value of 0, okay?

27
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,710
So it's parallel to the image plane.

28
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:38,630
Well, that's actually okay, what it means is that the plane that it

29
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:44,270
defines is also going to be perpendicular to the image plane,

30
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:46,910
which means it's going to go right through the origin.

31
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:50,990
So, the ideal line corresponds to the image that go through the origin, or

32
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:52,010
the principle point.

33
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:54,370
And that's typically in the middle of our images, but

34
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:56,730
remember, you, your images might be offset.

35
00:01:56,730 --> 00:02:02,080
So an ideal point is off in infinity, an ideal line goes through the origin.
