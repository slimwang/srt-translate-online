1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,320
Only few companies are big enough to
supply the needs of an entire market.

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:08,050
Even the large ones must break down
the total demand into segments and

3
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:10,440
choose those that the company's
best equipped to handle.

4
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:15,490
Market segmentation is marketing
strategy that involves dividing a broad

5
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:19,910
target market into subsets of consumers
who have common needs, wants,

6
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:21,084
demand, or characteristics.

7
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:25,120
You'll be developing a marketing
strategy that targets the individuals in

8
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:26,890
your chosen segment.

9
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:30,320
You can learn the basics of it in
the book that become the bible for

10
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,520
startups 25 years ago.

11
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:32,890
And it's still valid.

Crossing The Chasm, by Geoffrey Moore.

13
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:38,520
Let's meet Geoffrey Moore himself
to learn what he has to say

14
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:39,589
about market segmentation.

15
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:42,920
>> Hi, so my name's Geoffrey Moore.

16
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,690
I live in Silicon Valley.

17
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:49,451
I'm a business author, I'm a member
of a venture capital firm, and

18
00:00:49,451 --> 00:00:53,880
I consult and
advise technology companies, largely.

19
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:57,790
Entrepreneurs tend to have
visions of global domination, and

20
00:00:57,790 --> 00:01:00,150
in that model you want to
segment the whole world.

21
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:02,290
Because eventually the whole world
is going to buy your product,

22
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:04,620
it's just a question of
who's going to buy it first.

23
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:08,320
So, I think the whole world
thing is a great fantasy and

24
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,650
it keeps you going at night and
on the weekends, but

25
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:14,800
eventually if you're going to
actually light the fire.

26
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,460
You know when you light a fire,
you don't want to run a match up and

27
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:20,380
down under a very big log,
you're just going to burn your fingers.

28
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:23,390
What you want to do when you light
a fire is you get some kindling and

29
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:25,800
then you get some crumpled up paper,
and you get the match.

30
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,110
And you hold the match in one and

31
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:30,770
only one place until it
starts to burst into flame.

32
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:32,380
Then the flame can grow.

33
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:35,320
But so, the key thing with
the segmentation at the beginning for

34
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,700
an entrepreneur is, where are you
going to hold the match and

35
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:40,260
how long are you going to hold
it in place until it lights?

36
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:42,320
And sometimes you put it,
holding in the wrong place.

37
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,480
You're holding it under a brick and
bricks do not burn, right?

38
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,132
Okay.
So, you've got to move the match but,

39
00:01:47,132 --> 00:01:49,811
what you don't want to do is just
continually moving it back and forth.

40
00:01:49,811 --> 00:01:53,906
And entrepreneurs who are in love with
their product have a very tough time

41
00:01:53,906 --> 00:01:55,950
with this problem.

42
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:58,340
Entrepreneurs who are in love with their
customer, do not have this problem.

43
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,880
>> Okay, so how do we start this fire?

44
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,940
Let's explore the different
types of segmentation.
