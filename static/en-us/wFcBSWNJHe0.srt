00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,271
All right. Now we're back to interacting
with our ContentProvider,

2
00:00:03,271 --> 00:00:05,291
so it's time to have another exercise.

3
00:00:05,315 --> 00:00:07,397
Use the ContentProvider to insert

4
00:00:07,397 --> 00:00:10,821
the vector of ContentValue objects
into the database. (laughs)

5
00:00:10,821 --> 00:00:13,724
Don't worry, we're really almost done
with inserting data.

6
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:16,649
Next is the fun part
that makes this all worth it.
