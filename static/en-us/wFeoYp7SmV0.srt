Hello and welcome to this new lesson on Java interfaces. The purpose of Java

2
00:00:06,074 --> 00:00:10,627
interfaces is to let us unify common behavior. Let me give you an example of

3
00:00:10,627 --> 00:00:15,442
what I mean with common behavior. Here, I have a sample program that draws a

4
00:00:15,442 --> 00:00:19,537
delightful suburban scene with houses, and dogs and we'll add other suburban

5
00:00:19,537 --> 00:00:26,410
items to the mix soon enough. Let's look at the code. We have a list of houses,

6
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:34,074
we add a couple of houses. We have a list of dogs, we add a few dogs. Then we

7
00:00:34,074 --> 00:00:39,000
draw the houses and we draw the dogs. Now, we have to put the houses and the

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,499
dogs into separate ArrayLists because they're objects of different types. I

9
00:00:43,499 --> 00:00:49,050
can't put a dog in an ArrayList of houses or a house into an ArrayList of dogs.

10
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:53,452
Our suburban scene would not be complete without cars, so go ahead and add a

11
00:00:53,452 --> 00:00:59,780
few cars to our program. One for this house and the other two for the Mcmansion

12
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:01,510
over here.
