00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,694
We begin this lesson by talking about Henry Molaison. One thing we didn't

2
00:00:03,694 --> 00:00:07,785
discuss about HM was the task they had him engage in. In this task,

3
00:00:07,785 --> 00:00:12,010
neuropsychologist, Brenda Milner, who was working with HM, had him perform a

4
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:17,309
mirror tracing task like this one. HM was to track within two lines of the

5
00:00:17,309 --> 00:00:23,231
star, while viewing it only through a mirror. Which was the reverse image. So,

6
00:00:23,231 --> 00:00:27,061
if his hand moved one way, the hand in the mirror moved the other. They asked

7
00:00:27,061 --> 00:00:32,719
HN to perform this task up to ten times each day for three days. They counted

8
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:36,683
the errors each time he went outside of the lines. What's interesting is that

9
00:00:36,683 --> 00:00:40,587
HM's drawings improved even though he couldn't recall having done this task

10
00:00:40,587 --> 00:00:44,445
before. Now you're looking at the times that I tried it, and I'll be honest,

11
00:00:44,445 --> 00:00:48,675
this task was really hard to do. So what does this tell us about the brain? HM

12
00:00:48,675 --> 00:00:54,874
didn't remember engaging in this task, but he visibly improved. Well, it turns

13
00:00:54,874 --> 00:00:58,579
out that he couldn't form new explicit long-term memories due to damage to his

14
00:00:58,579 --> 00:01:04,099
hippocampus and surrounding areas, but he could learn new skills. As was

15
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:06,310
demonstrated by his performance on this task.
