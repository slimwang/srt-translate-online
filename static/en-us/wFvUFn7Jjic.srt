1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,280
At this point, the character of
our discussion of computability

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:05,320
is going to change significantly.

3
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:07,900
We've established the key
properties of Turing machines.

4
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:09,720
That they can do anything
we mean by computation,

5
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:14,130
and that we can pass a description of
a Turing machine to a Turing machine

6
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:15,280
as input for it to simulate.

7
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,930
With those points established, we won't
need to talk about the specifics of

8
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:21,860
Turing machines much anymore.

9
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:26,460
There will be little about tapes, or
states, transitions, or head positions.

10
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:30,000
Instead, we'll think about
computation at a very high level.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,119
Trusting that if we really had to,

12
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:33,810
we could write out
the Turing machine to do it.

13
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:36,680
If we need to write out code,
we'll do so

14
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:38,590
mostly in pseudocode or with pictures.

15
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:40,820
What is there left to talk about?

16
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:44,730
Well remember from the very first
lesson that we argued that not

17
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:46,890
all functions are computable or

18
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:50,440
as we later said not all languages
can be decided by Turing machines.

19
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:54,330
We're now in a good position to talk
about some of these undecidable

20
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:55,540
languages.

21
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:59,200
We had to wait until we established
the universality of Turing machines.

22
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,200
Because these languages
are going to consist of strings

23
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,400
that encode Turing machines.

24
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,190
The rest of the lesson we'll review
the definitions of recognizability and

25
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:12,200
decidability and then we'll talk
about the positive side of the story.

26
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:16,660
The languages about Turing machines
that we can decide or recognize.

27
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:18,790
As we'll see later,
there are plenty that we can't.
