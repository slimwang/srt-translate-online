1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,368
Number one here is moving the host array, h_in,

2
00:00:03,368 --> 00:00:06,743
to the GPU array, d_in.

3
00:00:06,743 --> 00:00:08,793
So we need to go host to device.

4
00:00:08,793 --> 00:00:11,738
This argument is going to be cudaMemcpy host to device.

5
00:00:11,738 --> 00:00:13,532
This transfer goes the other way,

6
00:00:13,532 --> 00:00:16,669
from an array on the GPU, d_out,

7
00:00:16,669 --> 00:00:19,407
to an array on the CPU, h_out.

8
00:00:19,407 --> 00:00:21,450
So we're going to go device to host.

9
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:26,907
CudaMemcpy device to device simply moves a piece of memory on the GPU from one place to another.
