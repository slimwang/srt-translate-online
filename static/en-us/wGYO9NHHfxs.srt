1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Now, let's get back to this idea of taking timings.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
When we're taking timings we're doing measurements.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Now we've changed what we're doing from having computer science

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:17,000
being a mathematical enterprise to having it be a experimental enterprise--

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
and experimental science. We're actually doing science.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
It's as if we're dealing with the messy world with some chemicals in a beaker,

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
and we're making measurements of those rather than trying to do mathematical proofs.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
One thing we know about doing experimental science

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
is that one measurement isn't going to be good enough.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
That was clear when we got a measurement of 0.0.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
We know that wasn't right. We know that there can be errors in measurements.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
One way in science that we deal with that is

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
by repeating the measurements multiple times.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I want you to tell me why you think some reasons are that scientists,

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
when they do an experiment, take more than one measurement.

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Is it because we want to reduce the chance of some external event

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
effecting the result?

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Because we want to reduce the natural random variation?

19
00:01:04,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Or because we want to reduce errors in the measurement process? Check all that apply.
