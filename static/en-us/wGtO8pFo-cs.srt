00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:03,960
I want you to think about
the prefix sums problem.

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:06,500
Suppose I give you
an array like this one.

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:09,937
The prefix sum at some position like,
say, this one,

4
00:00:09,937 --> 00:00:14,663
is the sum of all elements from the
beginning of the array to that position.

5
00:00:14,663 --> 00:00:16,611
So, in this example,

6
00:00:16,611 --> 00:00:22,669
the prefix sum at this point is 3
plus 4 minus 2 minus 1, or just 4.

7
00:00:22,669 --> 00:00:26,140
What about the prefix sum at a different
position like, say, this one?

8
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:30,170
The prefix sum at this point is 6.

9
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:32,210
And you could get that, of course,

10
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:36,160
by taking the prefix sum at this point,
adding 7, subtracting 5.

11
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:40,900
So just to recap,
the prefix sum at position i is

12
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:44,822
simply the sum from
a sub 1 up to a sub i.
