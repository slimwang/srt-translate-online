00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:04,200
Responsive design isn't just about flexible fluid designs, it's

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,730
also about adapting to different scenarios and environments, and

3
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:10,930
our primary tool for doing that is Media Queries.

4
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:14,580
Media Queries have their roots in the media type for

5
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:17,280
style sheets, used to declare a style sheet that's

6
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,660
only applied to certain media types; like when printing.

7
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:23,530
And in the at media section, in CSS, where

8
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:26,050
you can declare a subsection of the style sheet to

9
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:28,920
only be used for print or other media. For

10
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:32,090
example it's helpful to display the URL of hyperlinks

11
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:34,510
when printing, since you can't click on the links

12
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:37,360
on paper. So that's what this rule does, but

13
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:41,690
CSS3 Media Queries add a media query terms. This

14
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:44,470
lets us make condition rules in our style sheets

15
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:47,350
based on environmental factors, like the width of the

16
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:51,130
window or the orientation of the device. This opens

17
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:53,550
up a huge opportunity for us to make

18
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:57,380
truly adaptive layouts. There are a number of

19
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:01,330
different properties available inside these Media query expressions.

20
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:03,600
Like the width and height of the current window,

21
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,970
the width and height of the device, the

22
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:10,340
device orientation, the device aspect ratio and window aspect

23
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:14,310
ratio. Weather the, the device is grid based,

24
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:16,580
how many bits per color the device uses or

25
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:20,300
weather it's an indexed color device, or weather it's monochrome, the

26
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:22,260
overall resolution of the device, and

27
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:24,440
weather it's progressive or interlaced scanned.
