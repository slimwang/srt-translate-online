For the first six months as a Udacity

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:04,460
employee, I thought one of our coffee machines was

3
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:08,270
broken. Because it didn't work immediately upon me pushing

4
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:11,350
a specific button. What I eventually learned from a

5
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:14,020
colleague, was that the coffee machine needed time to

6
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:17,880
warm up prior to processing my request. This important

7
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:21,030
step wasn't part of my conceptual model. Hence, the

8
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:25,280
misunderstanding. The coffee machine failed me, by not providing

9
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:27,520
appropriate feedback. It should have let me

10
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:29,890
know that it had received my request. And

11
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:32,400
was taking time to warm up. We'll

12
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,910
cover the important topic of feedback more, soon.
