Consider two marketing campaigns. Campaign A has a response rate of 1%.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:16,000
And we have a second marketing campaign, Campaign B, that has a response rate of 1.01%.

00:00:16,000 --> 99:59:59,999
For each of these, we have 10 million data points. At 95% confidence, is this significant?
