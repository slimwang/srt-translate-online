00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,630
The rest of what we're about to do for this lesson is just talk a little bit

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:08,060
more about some of the properties of, of image formation and lenses and cameras.

3
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:13,100
Actually belongs more in a course called Computational Photography.

4
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:17,200
And my colleague Irfan Essa at Georgia Tech teaches one.

5
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,550
And there are others online.

6
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:22,240
And it teaches you sort of the math of the, of, of photography.

7
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,160
I'm only going to talk a little bit about it here.

8
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,730
Because next time we'll sort of run back and

9
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:29,580
revert to a very simplified model of imaging.

10
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:32,940
And do a much more complicated notion on recovery of computer vision.

11
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:35,730
So, the first thing about computation photography is well,

12
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:37,370
we don't actually use pinhole cameras.

13
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:39,050
Right? We use lenses.

14
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:41,910
And lenses have this notion of focus.

15
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:46,210
And in general, lenses are designed so that all the points at

16
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:51,690
a particular distance away will all be focused to the same point on your film or

17
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:53,180
on your recording medium.

18
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:56,400
One of the challenges there is that another point that's at

19
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,930
a different distance away, so here the blue point on the tree,

20
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:02,360
they're not all going to be focused at that point.

21
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:04,239
They're going to be sort of spread out a little bit.

22
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:08,090
And in fact, that spread is referred to sometimes as the circle of confusion.

23
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:12,010
It's a, if it's a single point there's a circle that it cuts out.

24
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:15,920
So, the way you change where things focus and

25
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,370
how much is in focus have to do with changing the shape of the lens.

26
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:23,550
So, talk just a little bit about lenses.

27
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:27,600
Sort of our slightly simplified view of lenses as follows.

28
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,580
One is that lenses have an optical axis,

29
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:33,010
along which light passes straight through unbent.

30
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:33,890
The other is,

31
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:39,970
is that light that comes in parallel are all bent to the same point.

32
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:42,270
And that's referred to as the focal point.

33
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:45,530
The other thing is in order to reduce the amount of spread of things,

34
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:47,670
lenses also have an aperture.

35
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:50,140
But now the aperture, instead of being just a single point,

36
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:52,860
is restricting the set of rays that are coming in.

37
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:56,380
It used to be that almost all lenses were cut out of parts of spheres,

38
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:59,910
because if we understood the mechanics of that and were easy to make, and

39
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:01,220
you could do the math.

40
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:04,460
But these days there are many of what are called aspherical elements

41
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:06,040
because it's all computer modeling.

42
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:08,090
We'll talk about that just a little bit at the very end.
