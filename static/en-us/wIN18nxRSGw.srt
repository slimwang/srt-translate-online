1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,895
So we know that the total money Grant will
earn from his sales is going to have to

2
00:00:03,907 --> 00:00:07,765
account for both the money he thought he
was going to make from all of the wipers

3
00:00:07,777 --> 00:00:11,529
and nozzles he thought he was going to
sell and also for the money that he will

4
00:00:11,541 --> 00:00:15,558
no longer make from the canceled orders.
So that means that we can already rule out

5
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:19,740
two of our answers. These two right here,
the second and the forth, each of which

6
00:00:19,752 --> 00:00:24,016
only takes into account one of those two
properties we need to have involved in our

7
00:00:24,028 --> 00:00:28,000
equation. Now we also know that Grant is
not going to make as much money as he

8
00:00:28,012 --> 00:00:32,250
originally thought that he would because
we need to remove the money that he would

9
00:00:32,262 --> 00:00:36,552
have gotten from the cancelled orders. If
you want to remove a quantity you want to

10
00:00:36,564 --> 00:00:40,449
subtract it, not add it. So that means
that this first answer choice, is the

11
00:00:40,461 --> 00:00:44,150
correct one. If we picked the third
answer, then Grant would end up with more

12
00:00:44,162 --> 00:00:48,009
money, since we said that both of these
quantities are positive after the orders

13
00:00:48,021 --> 00:00:52,024
were cancelled than he would have before
any orders were cancelled. So that doesn't

14
00:00:52,036 --> 00:00:55,829
make sense. I know that the wording of
things may have been a tiny bit confusing

15
00:00:55,841 --> 00:00:58,943
here, but in the end this is all going to
help Grant out a ton, so it's worth our

16
00:00:58,943 --> 00:00:58,943
effort.
