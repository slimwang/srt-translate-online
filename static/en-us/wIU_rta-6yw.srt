00:00:00,005 --> 00:00:04,168
Here is our filled out table. Now, of course we don't want to be dependent on

2
00:00:04,168 --> 00:00:07,752
calculators for everything, but they certainly do come in handy when we have

3
00:00:07,752 --> 00:00:13,233
calculations that end up giving us huge numbers, like 3,125. You can see this

4
00:00:13,233 --> 00:00:18,190
only at a value of x equals 5. Imagine if I had given you even higher x values.

5
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:21,251
Our numbers for h of x would have been huge. Some of these numbers you

6
00:00:21,251 --> 00:00:24,820
definitely could have figured out by hand or in your head. In fact, you

7
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:27,858
probably did. Though there might be some on this list you could have done that

8
00:00:27,858 --> 00:00:32,426
way, that you didn't realize. For example, when x equals negative 3, h of x is

9
00:00:32,426 --> 00:00:39,202
5 to the negative 3. This is just equal to 1 over 5 to the 3rd. Five to the

10
00:00:39,202 --> 00:00:44,652
3rd, is 125. So, that's 1 over 125. So this is the fractional of this decimal

11
00:00:44,652 --> 00:00:48,853
over here. This answer is perfectly acceptable, as well. Although, it's

12
00:00:48,853 --> 00:00:51,518
probably not what a calculator will give you, depending on what sort of device

13
00:00:51,518 --> 00:00:56,152
you're using. We can see something similar happening for 5 to the negative 2.

14
00:00:56,152 --> 00:00:59,742
That's just 1 over 5 squared, or 1 over 25.
