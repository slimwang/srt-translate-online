00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,420
To create this plot, we're going to pass in our variables

2
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:05,890
to ggplot as usual. We'll set x equal to age,

3
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:08,560
and y equal to median friend count. And we'll set

4
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:11,456
data equal to the data frame that we just created. So

5
00:00:11,456 --> 00:00:15,240
pf.fc by age, gender. Now I just need to add

6
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:18,540
gm line and pass up the color parameter inside the unaesthetic

7
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:21,470
wrapper. This time the color will take on the value

8
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:25,290
of gender. This will give me one line for males and

9
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:28,570
one line for females. Running this code, we get the same

10
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:31,600
exact plot. Hopefully you're feeling like a data guru at this point.
