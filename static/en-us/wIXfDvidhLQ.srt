00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,969
That's it! We're done! Great job finishing the class. You

2
00:00:03,969 --> 00:00:06,710
might be wondering, what should I try next? I'd encourage you

3
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:08,460
to have a look at other courses in the data

4
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:11,980
science track here at Udacity. You might consider taking Intro to

5
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:16,360
Data Science, Intro to Hadoop and MapReduce or maybe Intro

6
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:20,290
to Statistics. If you enjoyed this course, pretty much anything in

7
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:22,210
the data science track is going to be of interest to

8
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:25,380
you. If you'd like to learn more about MongoDB, we offer

9
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:28,410
a number of introductory and advanced online courses

10
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:31,900
on our own platform, at MongoDB University. These courses

11
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:34,000
cover all the details of MongoDB that we couldn't

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,370
quite fit into this course. For example, there you

13
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:39,170
will see just exactly how we scale MongoDB

14
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:42,860
to big data problems. These courses are completely free,

15
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:44,380
and taught in a style very much like the

16
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:48,567
one you just finished. Take a look at university.mongodb.com.
