1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The theorem essentially says is that if a cipher is perfect, it must have this property.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
It must be impractical in the sense that the number of possible keys

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
must be at least as big as the number of possible messages.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
We saw for the one-time pad that they were equal.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
We can always remove possible messages from the message set

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
so there's no problem with adding more keys.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
The problem is we need to have at least as many keys as messages.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Let's prove this property.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
We're going to prove it by contradiction.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
We're going to start by assuming that we do have a perfect cipher

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
that does not satisfy this property.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Suppose we do have some perfect cipher--we'll call it "E"--

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
where the number of possible messages is greater than the number of possible keys.

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
There is some ciphertext--call it c0 element of the set of possible ciphertexts.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Let's assume that that ciphertext is possible.

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
We know that there must be such a cipher text.

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
There is some key that encrypts some message to c0.

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:09,000
The probability that a message and key get encrypted to this ciphertext is greater than 0.

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
We know that such a ciphertext must exist.

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Now we have a our ciphertext c0.

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Let's try decrypting that.

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
We'll decrypt it with all keys in the key space.

23
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
We haven't mentioned what the decryption function is.

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
For the one-time pad it's exactly the same as the encryption function.

25
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
For this we don't want to assume this. I could be any function.

26
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
We'll assume there is some function D that is our decryption function.

27
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Since our cipher is correct--in order to be perfect it has to both be correct and perfectly secure.

28
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
That means the decryption function must have the property that if we decrypt

29
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
a message encrypted with the same key, we always get the same message out.

30
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
We don't need to know anything else about the decryption function than that.

31
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
We shouldn't assume anything, because all we're trying to do is show that

32
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,000
there is no possible choice for E that is both a correct encryption function and a perfect cipher.

33
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Now what happens when we decrypt c0 with all possible keys?

34
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Well, we're going to look at the set of messages that we can produce.

35
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:13,000
We'll call M0 the set of messages that we get by unioning over all possible keys

36
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
the result of decrypting the cipher text c0.

37
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
This models what an attacker would do.

38
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
They've intercepted some ciphertext. They're trying all possible keys.

39
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
This is what a brute-force attacker would do.

40
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Looking at all the possible messages that can be produced.

41
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Now I want you to think about which of these statements are true.

42
00:02:34,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Check all the statements that must be true.
