1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,110
So it is important to get an example I, I think

2
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:03,910
that the, the best way to kind of see an example

3
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:07,790
here is to draw a little picture for you that tells

4
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:11,520
you what the sort of underlying assumption behind ICA is. So here's

5
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,780
the kind of, or at least the way I see what

6
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:18,190
the fundamental assumption of ICA is. And that is this. You're, you're

7
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:22,100
assuming that the, there's a bunch of. Things in the world.

8
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:25,320
And these are going to be hidden variables. And they've got some properties

9
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:28,790
that, that are associated with them. Their random variables. They

10
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:31,400
are mutually independent of one another. That is if I

11
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,210
know the value of one it doesn't tell me anything

12
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:35,330
about the value of the other. But we don't know what

13
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:40,420
they are. And what we get to see are observables. This observable are given rise

14
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:45,750
to by the value of the hidden variables and they somehow combine in

15
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:50,830
a sort of linear fashion and our job, the job of any learner

16
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:52,400
in this case, any unsupervised learner in

17
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,150
this case is given your observables try to

18
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:58,540
find the hidden variables. Under the assumption that

19
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:01,290
these hidden variables are in fact independent of

20
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:03,490
one another. So, what's a concrete example of

21
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:04,530
that? I'm going to give you a concrete example

22
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:07,480
of that then I'm going to give you a demo that we found on the web. Okay?

23
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,350
>> Okay.

24
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:12,090
>> So, one problem where we know this is true is

25
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:15,800
something called the blind source separation problem. So what' s the Blind

26
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,950
Source Separation problem? It also has another name which is

27
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:20,550
the Cocktail Party Problem do you remember the Cocktail Party Problem?

28
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:21,850
>> I think so, yeah.

29
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:22,970
>> So, describe it to me.

30
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:27,270
>> So, not that I go to a lot of cocktail parties, but if you're

31
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:30,340
in a, in a large group of people like in a cafeteria or something like that.

32
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:30,720
>> Mhm.

33
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,980
>> And you're trying to listen to a conversation. It can

34
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:35,520
be very challenging because theres

35
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,505
all these different conversations happening simultaneously.

36
00:01:38,505 --> 00:01:39,633
>> Mm-hm.

37
00:01:39,633 --> 00:01:40,870
>> And we need

38
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:45,170
to be able to pull out that one source

39
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:47,920
that, that we're, that we're caring about, so that

40
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,270
we can listen to it while kind of separating

41
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:54,370
it out from what all the other noise sources are.

42
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:55,600
>> So what you just described to me is

43
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,230
that somehow you have a bunch of people, so

44
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:02,960
there's Charles, there's Michael and there's a push car.

45
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,640
And there all talking at once. And let's a imagine

46
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,630
in place of ears we have microphones. And these

47
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:13,300
microphones are actually recording everything that well everything that

48
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:16,040
they hear. So this means that this first microphone

49
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:19,520
is going to hear me. The second microphone is also going to

50
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,620
hear me and so does the third microphone... However,

51
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:24,490
they're going to each hear me at a slightly different

52
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:27,610
volume at a slightly different delay. Okay? Because they're

53
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:29,740
placed sort of randomly around the room. You with me?

54
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:31,350
>> I think so, yeah.

55
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:31,830
>> Okay,

56
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:34,310
surely, Michael, who just keeps talking and talking and

57
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:37,040
talking mostly about puns, is also going to be picked up

58
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,720
by each of the three microphones, and Pushgar, mainly complaining

59
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,860
that we aren't doing enough quizzes, is also going to

60
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:46,290
be heard by the three microphones. In this case if

61
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:48,980
we look at our other examples, the people are the

62
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:53,810
hidden variables. That is, they're the things that are causing

63
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:57,090
events to happen in the world. But what we have

64
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:59,870
are observable's. Are the microphones, and what it is that

65
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:02,890
they're recording. Now, if we're in a small enough room, it

66
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:06,500
turns out that physics tell us that, even though our voices

67
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:09,940
are all nonlinear and sound doesn't travel in a very linear

68
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:11,910
fashion the way that we would like, it turns out

69
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:13,770
that in a small enough room with all of the reflections

70
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:18,400
and everything, each of these microphones are well modeled as receiving

71
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,090
unknown linear comment, combination of all of the sources. So this

72
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:24,980
means that each one of these microphones actually contains a, a

73
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:29,210
different linear combination of each of our voices. Hey, you with me?

74
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:30,130
>> Yeah, it's interesting.

75
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:33,590
>> Right. And so, really, if I were to give you these three recordings

76
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:36,560
and I wanted to figure out what say, Michael Lipman was saying, all that

77
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,230
information is here, but I can't extract

78
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:41,290
Michael Lipman from microphone one, or microphone

79
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:43,650
two, or microphone three. But given all

80
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:47,210
of these microphones, I can in fact recover,

81
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:49,410
just Michael alone or just Charles alone or just

82
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:53,570
Pushcar alone, because ICA exactly tries to find this

83
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:56,620
notion of mutual independence without losing any information form

84
00:03:56,620 --> 00:04:00,050
the output. And this model here, of three people

85
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:04,470
talking, mostly independently, and being recorded by linear combination

86
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:07,710
by different microphones is exactly the model that ICA

87
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:10,680
was designed to represent. So, just to sort of

88
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,390
drive this home, let me give you an actual example

89
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:15,730
that we found on the web that they do exactly this problem. Okay?

90
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:16,750
>> Sure.
