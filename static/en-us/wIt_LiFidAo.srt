1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:04,710
The correct answers to this question
are that, the fact that virtualization

2
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:08,650
wasn't dominant technology
all these years is that

3
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:13,300
first mainframes weren't ubiquitous,
and then other hardware was cheap.

4
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:17,355
Majority of the companies did not
necessarily run mainframe computers.

5
00:00:17,355 --> 00:00:22,980
They ran servers that were based
on x86 architecture mostly.

6
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:27,870
This was affordable, and it was always
much simpler to just add new pieces

7
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:32,880
of hardware than to try to figure out
how to make multiple applications and

8
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,372
multiple operating systems coexist
on that same hardware platform.

9
00:00:37,372 --> 00:00:41,980
This trend of just buying more machines
if you need to run a different kind of

10
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:46,250
operating system to support
different applications continued for

11
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:47,650
a few decades actually.
