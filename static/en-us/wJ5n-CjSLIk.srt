1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,450
Let's visit each comparator and
look at the outputs.

2
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:06,210
Remember that plus comparators
take their inputs and

3
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:08,860
produce outputs in increasing order.

4
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:12,800
So for this example, 8 and
7 would become 7 and 8.

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:16,100
Minus comparators do just the opposite.

6
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:18,770
In this case the inputs
are already in descending order so

7
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:20,790
the outputs will be the same.

8
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:24,630
Now this comparator takes 7 and
6 as its inputs.

9
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:25,610
So it will flip them.

10
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:28,480
Same thing happens here.

11
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,400
Finally, you can check that this
column of inputs matches this

12
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,130
column of outputs.

13
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:35,570
Now, here's a thought question for you.

14
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:39,200
Suppose I change this minus
comparator to a plus comparator,

15
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,230
lets update these values.

16
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:43,770
Now, lets propagate the new values.

17
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:45,340
Notice what just happened.

18
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:48,160
The sequence is actually
already sorted at this stage.

19
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:52,090
Now that would seem to suggest that
these two comparators are actually

20
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:53,590
unnecessary.

21
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:55,300
But is that really true?

22
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:58,210
That is if I eliminated
these plus comparators,

23
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:03,070
would the leftover circuit
sort any input of four values?

24
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:04,239
I'll let you ponder that one.
