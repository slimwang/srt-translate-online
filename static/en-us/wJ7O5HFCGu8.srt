00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,263
We can also have functions where the n points are not included. For example, in

2
00:00:04,263 --> 00:00:08,539
this graph you can see that there's circles at either end point. Open circles

3
00:00:08,539 --> 00:00:12,829
other than closed circles, showing that neither of the end points are included

4
00:00:12,829 --> 00:00:16,946
in our domain. So in this case how would you write the domain using interval

5
00:00:16,946 --> 00:00:17,536
notation?
