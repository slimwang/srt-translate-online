1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:04,490
Here's what I came up with,
the ceiling of N over L plus 1.

2
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:07,010
It's easiest to see this by example.

3
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:09,910
Suppose N equals 4, and L equals 2.

4
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:14,550
Consider two cases, in the first case
suppose the array is aligned on an L

5
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:20,090
word boundary, then you would just need
ceiling of N over L equals 2 transfers.

6
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:22,100
But what if the array is not aligned?

7
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:24,410
Then you might need one extra transfer.

8
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:28,090
Now the purpose of this exercise is just
to make you aware that this can happen.

9
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:30,580
But for most of what we'll
do it's a minor detail.

10
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:33,180
We'll often ignore it, especially
when N is much greater than L.
