00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:02,490
Now before we make some of these projects, I

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:04,390
want to share with you of how I learned to

3
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:07,800
program. I remember in many of my introductory computer

4
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:11,050
science classes. The instructor would start out slow and my

5
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:13,440
friends and I, we would understand everything, but then

6
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:17,930
boom, the difficulty level would skyrocket. This would make a

7
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:20,760
lot of other students inside the class feel extremely

8
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:24,450
frustrated and intimidated by code and ultimately they would quit.

9
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:27,540
We will avoid that in this class. In

10
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:30,080
this class we will make challenging projects, but at

11
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:33,360
the same time we will ensure that you're comfortable

12
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,940
with the learning curve. So it is in that

13
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:38,880
spirit I want to ask you, how confident

14
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,660
do you feel in your ability to write computer

15
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:43,260
programs? Programs like the ones we are going to

16
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:45,810
build in this class. Here are some answer choices.
