1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So let's see one way to do it, together.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
To get the value of the left_child, I'll just call eval_exp recursively.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
To get the value of the right_child, I'll do the same--

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
but for the right-hand side of the Abstract Syntax Tree.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
If the operator is (+), I'll just add them together--

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
returning the sum of the left_value and the right_value.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Otherwise, if the operator is (-),

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I'll just subtract them--return the left_value minus the right_value.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
To some of you, this may seem a little weird.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm defining (+) in terms of (+) in Python.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
That is, in order to explain how JavaScript works,

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm saying well, JavaScript asked you to do some Addition--

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
why don't you just do it in Python?

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
But remember that an interpreter is really like

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
a translator--so it should not be surprising.

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
If you were teaching someone how to speak French

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
and they ask you what does a French word mean--

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
what's the French word for "big" or how do I interpret the French word "grande"--

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
you might tell them: oh, it's just like the word "big"

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
in the language that we speak.

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
And this is that notion of their universal underlying concepts

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
but we just have slightly different syntax for them.

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
In this particular case, it looks a little weird

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
because the JavaScript and the Python syntax for (+)

25
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
are exactly the same.

26
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
But you'll see slight differences later.

27
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Remember that, for example, in function declarations,

28
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
JavaScript and Python do actually look different.

29
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
So it should look very similar now

30
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
because the translation is very direct.

31
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
This is like Romance languages

32
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
that share common Latin roots.
