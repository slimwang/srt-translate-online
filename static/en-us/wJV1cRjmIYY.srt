1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:05,500
And the answer is this guy is closer these guys over her are closer.

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:09,750
And the way to see this is you can make a line between the cluster centers and

3
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:12,890
then draw an equidistant and orthogonal line and that

4
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:17,270
line separate the space into a half space that's closer to center number one,

5
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:21,380
which is the one over here, and a half space that's closer to center number two,

6
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:22,800
which is the space over here.
