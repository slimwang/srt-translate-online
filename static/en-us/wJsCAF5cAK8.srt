[Thrun] And here is our car network which we discussed at the very beginning of this unit.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
How many parameters do we need to specify this network?

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Remember, there are 16 total variables,

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:25,000
and the naive joint over the 16 will be 2 to the 16th minus 1, which is 65,535.

5
00:00:25,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Please write your answer into this box over here.
