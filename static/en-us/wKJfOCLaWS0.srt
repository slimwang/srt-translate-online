00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,860
Because grits is an equal opportunity fragging environment, we need to allow

2
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:08,530
players without mice to be able to still compete in our environment. This

3
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:11,410
means, that we need to allow them to shoot with keyboard controls, as already

4
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:15,327
mentioned. The code for this is very similar to what we've seen before. For

5
00:00:15,327 --> 00:00:19,295
example, we need to simply go through and pull the key state of our shooting

6
00:00:19,295 --> 00:00:23,327
directional keys, to create a directional vector that we then use to launch

7
00:00:23,327 --> 00:00:28,371
projectiles. Your task is to fill in the supplied code below, to sum up the

8
00:00:28,371 --> 00:00:31,600
keyboard input, and normalize the resulting vector.
