To make sure we understand some of the basic differences between a process and

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:06,689
a thread, let's take a look at a quiz.

3
00:00:06,689 --> 00:00:10,630
You'll need to answer if the following statements apply to processes,

4
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:12,230
threads, or both.

5
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:15,360
And please mark your answers in the text boxes.

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,350
The first statement is, can share a virtual address space.

7
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:22,750
Next, take longer to context switch.

8
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:26,130
The third one, have an execution context.

9
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:27,460
The fourth one,

10
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:32,090
usually result in hotter caches when multiple such entities exist.

11
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:35,870
And then the last statement, make use of some communication mechanisms.
