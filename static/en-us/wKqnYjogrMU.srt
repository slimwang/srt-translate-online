1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:01,530
The recycler view is set up so

2
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:05,470
that a single adapter can
drive multiple recycler views.

3
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:08,109
To add back end support for
click handling and

4
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:11,690
empty views, we're going to give the
recycler view adapter knowledge of our

5
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:16,420
particular recycler view, which does
kind of break the standard model.

6
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:19,210
But it's alright,
because we're not going to

7
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:22,370
be driving multiple recycler
views to our single adapter.

8
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:24,300
So we're going to add
back click handling and

9
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,130
empty view into forecast fragment.

10
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:29,940
In forecast adapter, we're going to
create a forecast adapter on click

11
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:35,420
handler that returns a date long,
and a ForecastAdapter ViewHolder.

12
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:38,590
And then we're going to add
a ForecastAdapteronClickHandler

13
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:39,940
member variable.

14
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:43,280
We're going to update the
ForecastAdapter constructor to have it

15
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,800
take the ForecastAdapteronClickHandler
and empty view.

16
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,487
Then we'll have
ForecastAdapterviewHolder implement

17
00:00:50,487 --> 00:00:52,360
a view.OnClickListener.

18
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:54,860
And when you construct a viewHolder,

19
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:59,570
set the viewHolder to be
the OnClickListener for the view.

20
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:00,920
So, does that make sense?

21
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:05,180
You basically pass in the view to
the ViewHolder when you construct it.

22
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:08,450
You have the ViewHolder
implement OnClickListener and

23
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:12,910
then, you actually set that viewHolder
to be the OnClickListener for

24
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:15,080
the view at that time of construction.

25
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:19,352
Then, you call the ForecastAdapter
OnClickListener from your

26
00:01:19,352 --> 00:01:22,290
individual ViewHolder OnClickListener.

27
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:24,170
If you have any questions,

28
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:26,770
I'm sure we'll have some
great instructor notes here.

29
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:33,038
Set the visibility of the empty view
In SwapCursor based upon the item count.

30
00:01:33,038 --> 00:01:34,545
So this is pretty simple,

31
00:01:34,545 --> 00:01:38,179
we're going to put back in empty
view handling which is awesome.

32
00:01:38,179 --> 00:01:41,031
And then in the ForecastFragment,

33
00:01:41,031 --> 00:01:45,888
we're going to add back in empty
view and onClick handling.

34
00:01:45,888 --> 00:01:49,392
When I say in ForecastFragment, add
back in empty view and onClick handling,

35
00:01:49,392 --> 00:01:53,290
what I mean is we commented a whole
bunch of code out in ForecastFragment.

36
00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:56,950
We're going to un-comment that, and then
we're going to connect it up to these

37
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:00,980
new mechanisms we've built to handle
empty view and onClick handling.
