1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,766
Reflecting back on my own experiences,
I never fully understood

2
00:00:03,766 --> 00:00:06,585
content providers until I
had to actually build one.

3
00:00:06,585 --> 00:00:09,471
When I was on the contacts team,
I used a content provider,

4
00:00:09,471 --> 00:00:12,650
but I didn't understand
the inner workings of it.

5
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:17,450
It was this unknown beast that
other engineers got to deal with.

6
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:20,700
When I became the tech lead of the
Google Keep app, which the note taking

7
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:24,570
app, we had to build the app from
scratch, including the content provider.

8
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:27,490
We face some really challenging
decisions in early days

9
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:29,500
about how to model data.

10
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:34,600
We knew we wanted to have a database so
that's we could easily search notes, but

11
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,140
there was still a lot of
details about the database and

12
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:39,619
the content provider that
we had to figure out.

13
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:42,840
We did some investigative work.

14
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,180
Talking to other app teams like Gmail,
calendar, music apps and

15
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:50,500
we also looks at their
code basis as well.

16
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:54,590
And even though we got
advice from these engineers

17
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:58,280
I still felt like I had
analysis paralysis.

18
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:02,520
I couldn't make decision on which way
we should go because I wasn't sure,

19
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:06,310
you know, if we met regret later or
in my influence.

20
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:09,890
It might limit us from extending
to other features in the future.

21
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:15,140
Ultimately, though I had to realize that
every decision we make will have trade

22
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:19,680
offs and you just have to make the best
decision you can with the data you have

23
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,350
available and know that in the future
you could always refactor the code.

24
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:29,000
So we buckled down, made some decisions,
built the content provider and

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,860
we also wrote a lot
of unit tests to make

26
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:35,460
sure that the provider was working
in the way that we expected.

27
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:39,150
Once the provider was solid, then we
could move on to other challenges, like

28
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:43,860
syncing notes across devices, and so
that it would appear on the Web as well.

29
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:48,380
And as we added all those features,
the team naturally grew, and

30
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:52,080
I had to work on my leadership and
mentoring skills,

31
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:56,740
and there are also many more technical
decisions that I had to make.

32
00:01:56,740 --> 00:02:00,600
One last stop before I close is when
we were first creating the nano degree,

33
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:04,430
I asked a lot of my coworkers, what are
the qualities of the best engineers that

34
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:07,540
you've worked with because we
want to teach those to our students.

35
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:11,240
And one answer I really love is when
someone said the best engineers

36
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,500
are fearless.

37
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:16,840
They're not afraid to tackle
a problem that seems impossible and

38
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,710
where they don't know if they're
going to succeed or fail.

39
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:23,578
Because I think that's how amazing
products and experiences get created.

40
00:02:23,578 --> 00:02:27,171
You don't have to have all
the technical knowledge on android, but

41
00:02:27,171 --> 00:02:29,890
the attitude that you carry
can bring you very far.
