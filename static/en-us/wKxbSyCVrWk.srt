00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,370
In the documentation for
the GraphDefinedDomain class, we can see

2
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:09,300
that it has only one constructor,
which takes as an argument a single int.

3
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:14,340
This int is the number of states
that the domain should have.

4
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:19,173
Since we have already defined and
initialized the variable numStates to

5
00:00:19,173 --> 00:00:22,380
be 6, we could either pass
the variable num_States or

6
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:24,810
the number 6 to the constructor.

7
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:28,410
Though it would probably be
better to pass numStates, so

8
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:30,940
we don't have a magic
number in our code.

9
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:33,230
Also, looking through the list
of methods available to

10
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:37,895
a GraphDefinedDomain object,
we can find the method, generateDomain,

11
00:00:37,895 --> 00:00:41,335
which takes no arguments and
outputs a Domain object.

12
00:00:41,335 --> 00:00:45,035
This Domain object will have six states
since we specified this in creating

13
00:00:45,035 --> 00:00:46,645
the generator object.

14
00:00:46,645 --> 00:00:50,075
I'll go ahead and fill in
the second blank with this method.

15
00:00:50,075 --> 00:00:53,725
Note that we could create a second
domain by calling the generateDomain

16
00:00:53,725 --> 00:00:55,490
function a second time.

17
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:59,410
This second domain would be functionally
separate from the original domain

18
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:03,930
object, but they would have the same
initial structure as defined

19
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:08,358
by the specifications given to
the GraphDefinedDomain object.

20
00:01:08,358 --> 00:01:12,130
Essentially a GraphDefinedDomain
acts like a blueprint for

21
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:14,270
the domain objects it generates.

22
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:17,320
However, since we won't be needing
tow different domain objects for

23
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:20,450
this project, I'll go ahead and
delete the object I just added.
