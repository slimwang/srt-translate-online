1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:04,420
Sorting through command line output like this, will get boring really quickly.

2
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:07,800
So I've created a visualization that we will use throughout the course.

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:11,640
We'll launch this with the following commands, but what I recommend is to have

4
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:16,260
one tab open, where we will compile and package our Storm program in Maven, and

5
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:20,430
run using the Storm submission process I just showed you.

6
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:23,960
I recommend you create on your local machine, and

7
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:27,350
depending on your operating system this can either be a new window,

8
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:31,680
where you launch a new batch shell, or simply a new tab on your terminal.

9
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:33,960
I've created three new tabs here.

10
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:38,180
But here we see the tab in real time, this is in my local machine and

11
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:42,830
if I type ls I can see that here is ud381, cd into ud381.

12
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:48,760
And now instead of vagrant up, we simply log into the machine using vagrant ssh.

13
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:52,590
So now you see I have one tab open with our mvn storm commands, and

14
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:55,380
one tab open that I'll be using for our visualization.

15
00:00:55,380 --> 00:01:01,840
In step one of the written direction, simply cd into /vagrant/viz and

16
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:08,330
ls and you'll see the Python program, app.py, along with the static and template

17
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:12,880
folders that, if you follow the optional exercise, you put your picture into.

18
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:18,360
In step two, launch your Flask microserver by typing python app.py.

19
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:21,790
Python app.py and hit Enter.

20
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:27,060
Here we see that our flat server is running on an IP address of 0.0.0.0:5000,

21
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:34,830
which simply means that it's running on our local machine on port 5000.

22
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:40,800
In step three of the written instructions, open a new tab in your web browser,

23
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:46,200
either Chrome, Firefox, or Internet Explorer, type

24
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:51,260
in the following address, or simply cut and paste.

25
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:53,480
It's http://127.0.0.1:5000.

26
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:57,546
I'm just going to copy and paste this.

27
00:01:57,546 --> 00:01:59,290
Copy, paste.

28
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:00,960
And once I hit Enter,

29
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,650
I'm now communication with our virtual machine through port 5000.

30
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:08,750
And you should see the visualization, Udacity and

31
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:11,410
Twitter bring you real time analytics with Storm.

32
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:13,760
Along with the Udacity and Twitter logo.

33
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,840
Next, if I look back to our flash server, we see that we

34
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:21,460
have a GET request that just came in for channel, WordCountTopology.

35
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:24,700
One note here is that if you're having problems making that connection,

36
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:25,440
that's okay.

37
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,800
And we do have a troubleshooting section at the end of this lesson,

38
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,460
that can review a few of the common troubleshooting solutions.

39
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:38,090
Finally for an optional personalization exercise this requires your photo or

40
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:42,940
icon to be located in the folder /vagrant/viz/static.

41
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:47,060
And remember this was the optional exercise to a previous lesson.

42
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:52,490
So in step one of the optional exercise open your text editor, and again I'm

43
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:57,750
using Atom in your text editor, and if you're using Atom click Open and click.

44
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:02,990
On the top level file, ud381, not any of the individual files, but

45
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:05,100
on the top level and click Open.

46
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:09,510
And you should see the file hierarchy appear on the left-hand side like so.

47
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:13,980
Once you have the top folder open in your text editor, navigate to.

48
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,610
Your vis templates section.

49
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:24,990
So we go to vis templates and open the file cloud.html.

50
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:27,060
So cloud html.

51
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:30,320
This is our basic html file for our visualization.

52
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,040
We see that the Udacity logo, and

53
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:36,480
Twitter logo, are defined right here in the body h1 tag.

54
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,220
To add our image, we simply copy and

55
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:42,840
paste the Twitter logo, and change the name to the picture that you defined.

56
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:47,290
Mine was LouisAtUdacity.jpg.

57
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:50,960
Let's personalize the page further, by coming to the Word Cloud

58
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,590
exclamation points, and just naming it with your name.

59
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:56,920
So I'll say Louis's Word Cloud.

60
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:01,350
Next, navigate to your visualization, and simply hit the refresh button.

61
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:05,980
And you should see your picture, and your name with your word cloud appear.

62
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:09,610
So congratulations, on personalizing your visualization.

63
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:13,450
And as we go through the course, you can take screenshots of

64
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:17,620
your visualization and post them to the forum, and we'll know it's you.

65
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:18,120
Great job.
