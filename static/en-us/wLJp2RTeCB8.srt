00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,450
Right now, the bullets the GigaGal
fires, just fly on forever.

00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:06,939
Hitting characters in
the next game over or,

00:00:06,939 --> 00:00:10,310
more practically,
eventually slowing the game down.

4
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:12,645
Let's fix that by cleaning
up the bullets and

5
00:00:12,645 --> 00:00:14,490
our plasma blasts that leave the screen.

6
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:17,930
Check out the to do's
in the course code.

7
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:19,550
To clean up after ourselves and

8
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:22,320
remove any bullets that are beyond
the visible area of the screen.
