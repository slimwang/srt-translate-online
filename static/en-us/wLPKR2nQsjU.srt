1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:03,940
This course is about learning how to make an iOS app.

2
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:06,620
The app we will build together lets you record your voice.

3
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:10,500
Comparing apples and oranges is fruitless.

4
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:16,920
And then it lets you replay the audio and effects to it like the chipmunk voice.

5
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,900
>> Comparing apples and oranges is fruitless.

6
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:22,790
>> My name is Kunal and I will be your instructor for the course.

7
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:24,140
While building this app.

8
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:27,900
We will use Apple's new programming language Swift.

9
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:28,750
But don't worry.

10
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:30,560
We want go too fast.

11
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,050
If you've never developed an iPhone app before.

12
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:34,950
Then, this is the class for you.

13
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:37,370
If you have some experience with Objective-C,

14
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:40,440
which is another programming language, then you may encounter some

15
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:43,130
familiar ideas in the course that you should feel free to skip.

16
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:46,970
In order to succeed in this course, you should be familiar with some

17
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:51,910
basic programming ideas like if statements, loops, and classes.

18
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:53,240
There is a link in the instructor notes,

19
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,940
that highlights all of the prerequisites.

20
00:00:55,940 --> 00:01:00,310
Throughout this course, we will grapple with a lot of new app related ideas.

21
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:01,880
Let's talk about them in the next video.
