00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:05,430
Here is Acme's vocabulary. Some of it should be similar to you from the Garland

2
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:08,920
and Shaw paper that you read, and terms that we have been using to describe

3
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:13,367
architecture so far. First off is components, these are computational elements

4
00:00:13,367 --> 00:00:17,860
and data stores. Along with them come connectors, which are communication and

5
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:24,350
coordination among. The components. Ports are com, component interfaces,

6
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:29,680
possibly including protocols. And roles are similarly connector interfaces. So

7
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:33,290
you can imagine plugging together components and

8
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:38,020
connectors using their their po, ports and roles. The Acme term for

9
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:42,490
configuration is a system. It is the set of components and

10
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:46,130
connectors you have for a particular architecture you're describing,

11
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:52,010
the actual configuration specified via what Acme calls attachments of the ports

12
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:58,220
to the roles. I'll also be talking about representations, which is Acme's way

13
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:04,000
of describing hierarchical decomposition across multiple levels of abstraction.

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,390
And rep-maps which are specific bindings between those levels of abstractions.

15
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:14,660
Those seven terms constitute all that Acme

16
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:18,720
requires of you to understand in terms of building architectural descriptions.
