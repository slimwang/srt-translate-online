1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
What breadth first search does is it always expands out in levels.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
So h expands into i and j, one and the other first, and then one of the other of these

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
has expanded but with only one level, and before we go any deeper, 3 has nodes,

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
j's nodes get expanded next, and only after everything distance 2

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
away from h has been expanded, will o all get its chance.
