00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
I'm here with Sara Alspaugh, who is a PhD student at Berkeley,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
in the lab where she works on energy-aware computing.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
So tell us about this here.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I'm working on a project in which we try to create electric loads

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
whose power consumption can be scheduled at a given point in time

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
in order to make use of renewable supplies of energy like wind and solar

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
which are only available when there's wind or sun

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
and not available when we necessarily need them to be.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
And so on this project we tried to create a computing cluster

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
in which we scheduled the work that the cluster did

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
at times when there was wind energy available.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
So for instance, the types of work this cluster might be doing

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
is you might have some set of these machines which act as web frontends

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
and respond to search queries, and they would need to respond to the search queries

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
as soon as the query came in, and you wouldn't be able to schedule this work any other time.

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
But some of the other stuff that the computing cluster might be doing

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
is building the index for the search engine,

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
and that sort of work has some flexibility in when you actually can do it,

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
so you can wait until there's wind energy available to schedule this work.

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
And so these machines can do their work powered off of wind energy,

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
and the rest of the time you can keep them in a low power state

22
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
so they're not consuming energy.
