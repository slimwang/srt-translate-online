1
00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:03,016
To find the balance after two years, we need to first start out with the amount

2
00:00:03,016 --> 00:00:08,830
of money that's in the account at the beginning of the second year. We know

3
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:13,510
that's the amount that the account has at the end of the first year. 10,000

4
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:18,816
times 1 plus 0.03. Now, in fact, that's the same value that belongs in these

5
00:00:18,816 --> 00:00:23,770
other two green boxes. The reason it goes here is because this is the quantity

6
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:27,865
that we're going to use to calculate the new amount of interest that needs to

7
00:00:27,865 --> 00:00:34,070
be added. Now if we look at this entire expression, we can see that what can be

8
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:40,650
factored out, is what's already in the green boxes, 10,000 times 1 plus 0.03.

9
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:44,130
If we factor that out of each term, then what we would end up with for the

10
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:47,790
first term here would just be 1, and for the second term it would be 0.03, as

11
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:55,633
we see in the parentheses here. Now looking right here, what we see is repeated

12
00:00:55,633 --> 00:01:02,443
multiplication of 1 plus 0.03. Using exponent notation, that gives us 10,000

13
00:01:02,443 --> 00:01:06,487
times the quantity 1 plus point oh 3 squared.
