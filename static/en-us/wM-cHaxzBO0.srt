00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,619
We can see here that the binomial we have is y minus z, which down here is going

2
00:00:05,619 --> 00:00:11,436
to mean x minus 2. So that's what belongs in this first set of parantheses. Then

3
00:00:11,436 --> 00:00:16,954
the trinomial is y squared which is x squared why don't you substitute in x,

4
00:00:16,954 --> 00:00:22,436
plus y c which is really x times 2, but I'm going to write that as 2x. And then

5
00:00:22,436 --> 00:00:26,706
plus z squared. Which is just plus 4. Awesome! I know it might feel a little bit

6
00:00:26,706 --> 00:00:30,600
silly to find a factorization that's so much more complicated than the initial

7
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:34,267
expression. But once we talk more about higher order polynomials, you'll

8
00:00:34,267 --> 00:00:38,330
understand what the importance of writing out factorizations like this is. I'll

9
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:42,697
give you a hint that we've already talked about. Each linear factor is showing

10
00:00:42,697 --> 00:00:47,165
us an x-intercept of a graph. There's a ton of exciting stuff ahead. So just get

11
00:00:47,165 --> 00:00:47,587
ready.
