00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,360
Reshooting video 11 solution.

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,710
So, previously we found a histogram of the signed errors of using our

3
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:10,820
guess of 1,451 and a half seconds.

4
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:15,200
Here we're trying to find a similar histogram, but of the absolute errors.

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,770
So, to do that we're going to do something extremely similar.

6
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:20,520
Lets again run through the time until next list.

7
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,870
So, here again we're going to run through the time until next list.

8
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:27,060
But instead of just depending the signed difference here,

9
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:30,950
we're going to create a new list, abs_diffs.

10
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:34,220
And we're going to append the absolute value of the very same difference.

11
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:36,760
So, lets just go ahead and evaluate that.

12
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:39,960
Now that we have those values, we can create a histogram.

13
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,730
So, let's just recall what we're looking at, we're looking at each actual

14
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:50,030
intertweet time and subtracting from it, our guess of 1,451 and a half seconds.

15
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:53,000
We've collected all of those differences together in a list and

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,490
this is the histogram of those differences.

17
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:58,910
And, let's use describe to get the answers that we want.

18
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:04,819
You can see here that the mean absolute difference is 4446.8.
