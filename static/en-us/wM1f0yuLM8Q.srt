[Norvig] Here's a definition of card_ranks that's almost right.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
We say what card_ranks does. It returns a list of the ranks sorted with higher first.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
We pulled the ranks out of the cards,

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
so here we're iterating over the cards and we're having 2 values: the rank and the suit.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
And what this is doing is saying each card is a 2 value element,

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
and we can break down those 2 elements into the first and second,

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
the one that has rank 0 and rank 1 or index 0 and index 1.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
And so we're saying a card consists of a rank and a suit,

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
and we're only going to collect up the ranks and make that into a list.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
So ranks is the list of ranks, then we sorted it and we said we want to reverse sort

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
so that the higher comes first rather than the lower, and then we return the ranks.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:57,000
This is almost right, but the problem is if we just pull out the rank of each card as is,

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:05,000
then the rank T for 10 is the highest because T comes alphabetically after A

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
and Q and all the other cards. But we don't want that.

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Instead we want 10 to map to the number 10 and J to the number 11 and so on.

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
So we're going to have to come up with a way of fixing that,

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
taking these letters that we pulled out of the cards

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
and mapping them into an integer in the correct way.

19
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
See if you can fix this definition of card_ranks

20
00:01:28,000 --> 99:59:59,999
to correctly return a list of numbers, not a list of characters.
