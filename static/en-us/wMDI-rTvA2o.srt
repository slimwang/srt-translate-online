1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,400
This first statement gives a definite time, which is like a point on a timeline.

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:09,515
So, point is the correct answer. The second describes a distance, which is like

3
00:00:09,515 --> 00:00:13,735
a vector. No specific point at sea level is given, so this does not describe a

4
00:00:13,735 --> 00:00:18,865
location. So, this statement describes a vector. This third sentence describes a

5
00:00:18,865 --> 00:00:23,577
duration and no specific time, so it's like a vector. Finally, the fourth

6
00:00:23,577 --> 00:00:30,507
describes the location, given another location, and a motion vector, so it's a

7
00:00:30,507 --> 00:00:32,063
specific point.
