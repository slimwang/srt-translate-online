1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,001
So a really important example

2
00:00:02,001 --> 00:00:04,371
of machine learning is SPAM detection.

3
00:00:04,371 --> 00:00:06,507
We all get way too much email

4
00:00:06,507 --> 00:00:08,442
and a good number of those are SPAM.

5
00:00:08,442 --> 00:00:12,003
Here are 3 examples of email.

6
00:00:12,003 --> 00:00:14,281
Dear Sir: First I must solicit your confidence

7
00:00:14,281 --> 00:00:16,718
in this transaction, this is by virtue of its nature

8
00:00:16,718 --> 00:00:19,156
being utterly confidential and top secret...

9
00:00:19,156 --> 00:00:22,291
This is likely SPAM.

10
00:00:22,291 --> 00:00:23,924
Here's another one.

11
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:25,125
In upper caps.

12
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:28,729
99 MILLION EMAIL ADDRESSES FOR ONLY $99

13
00:00:28,729 --> 00:00:31,031
This is very likely SPAM.

14
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:33,007
And here's another one.

15
00:00:33,007 --> 00:00:35,302
Oh, I know it's blatantly OT

16
00:00:35,302 --> 00:00:37,337
but I'm beginning to go insane.

17
00:00:37,337 --> 00:00:40,107
Had an old Dell Dimension XPS sitting in the corner

18
00:00:40,107 --> 00:00:41,408
and decided to put it to use.

19
00:00:41,408 --> 00:00:42,098
And so on and so on.

20
00:00:42,098 --> 00:00:45,488
Now this is likely not SPAM.

21
00:00:45,488 --> 00:00:47,214
How can a computer program

22
00:00:47,214 --> 00:00:49,816
distinguish between SPAM and not SPAM?

23
00:00:49,816 --> 00:00:51,985
Let's use this as an example

24
00:00:51,985 --> 00:00:55,622
to talk about machine learning for discrimination

25
00:00:55,622 --> 00:00:59,059
using Bayes Networks.

26
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:01,094
In SPAM detection

27
00:01:01,094 --> 00:01:03,497
we get an email

28
00:01:03,497 --> 00:01:05,199
and we wish to categorize it

29
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:07,134
either as SPAM

30
00:01:07,134 --> 00:01:10,103
in which case we don't even show it to the reader

31
00:01:10,103 --> 00:01:12,678
or what we call HAM

32
00:01:12,678 --> 00:01:15,409
which is the technical word for

33
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:19,713
an email worth passing on to the person being emailed.

34
00:01:19,713 --> 00:01:21,381
So the function over here

35
00:01:21,381 --> 00:01:23,183
is the function we're trying to learn.

36
00:01:23,183 --> 00:01:26,032
Most SPAM filters use human input.

37
00:01:26,032 --> 00:01:28,559
When you go through email

38
00:01:28,559 --> 00:01:32,125
you have a button called IS SPAM

39
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:34,598
which allows you as a user to flag SPAM

40
00:01:34,598 --> 00:01:37,798
and occasionally you will say an email is SPAM.

41
00:01:37,798 --> 00:01:40,234
If you look at this

42
00:01:40,234 --> 00:01:43,213
you have a typical supervised machine learning situation

43
00:01:43,213 --> 00:01:45,038
where the input is an email

44
00:01:45,038 --> 00:01:47,407
and the output is whether you flag it as SPAM

45
00:01:47,407 --> 00:01:49,276
or if we don't flag it

46
00:01:49,276 --> 00:01:52,246
we just think it's HAM.

47
00:01:52,246 --> 00:01:54,248
Now to make this amenable to

48
00:01:54,248 --> 00:01:55,148
a machine learning algorithm

49
00:01:55,148 --> 00:01:57,191
we have to talk about how to represent emails.

50
00:01:57,191 --> 00:02:00,387
They're all using different words and different characters

51
00:02:00,387 --> 00:02:02,723
and they might have different graphics included.

52
00:02:02,723 --> 00:02:06,026
Let's pick a representation that's easy to process.

53
00:02:06,026 --> 00:02:09,329
And this representation is often called

54
00:02:09,329 --> 00:02:10,898
Bag of Words.

55
00:02:10,898 --> 00:02:14,701
Bag of Words is a representation

56
00:02:14,701 --> 00:02:15,869
of a document

57
00:02:15,869 --> 00:02:17,671
that just counts the frequency

58
00:02:17,671 --> 00:02:18,839
of words.

59
00:02:18,839 --> 00:02:22,309
If an email were to say Hello

60
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:24,382
I will say Hello.

61
00:02:24,382 --> 00:02:26,547
The Bag of Words representation

62
00:02:26,547 --> 00:02:27,915
is the following.

63
00:02:27,915 --> 00:02:31,685
2-1-1-1

64
00:02:31,685 --> 00:02:33,739
for the dictionary

65
00:02:33,739 --> 00:02:36,029
that contains the 4 words

66
00:02:36,029 --> 00:02:38,959
Hello I will say.

67
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:41,395
Now look at the subtlety here.

68
00:02:41,395 --> 00:02:43,073
Rather than representing each individual word

69
00:02:43,073 --> 00:02:46,066
we have a count of each word

70
00:02:46,066 --> 00:02:49,102
and the count is oblivious

71
00:02:49,102 --> 00:02:52,222
to the order in which the words were stated.

72
00:02:52,222 --> 00:02:55,175
A Bag of Words representation

73
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:57,411
relative to a fixed dictionary

74
00:02:57,411 --> 00:03:01,014
represents the counts of each word

75
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:03,817
relative to the words in the dictionary.

76
00:03:03,817 --> 00:03:06,082
If you were to use a different dictionary

77
00:03:06,082 --> 00:03:08,488
like hello and good-bye

78
00:03:08,488 --> 00:03:10,029
our counts would be

79
00:03:10,029 --> 00:03:13,193
2 and 0.

80
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:14,795
However, in most cases

81
00:03:14,795 --> 00:03:17,164
you make sure that all the words found

82
00:03:17,164 --> 00:03:18,089
in messages

83
00:03:18,089 --> 00:03:19,009
are actually included in the dictionary.

84
00:03:19,009 --> 00:03:22,436
So the dictionary might be very, very large.

85
00:03:22,436 --> 00:03:25,845
Let me make up an unofficial example

86
00:03:25,845 --> 00:03:30,143
of a few SPAM and a few HAM messages.

87
00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:32,779
Offer is secret.

88
00:03:32,779 --> 00:03:35,616
Click secret link.

89
00:03:35,616 --> 00:03:37,826
Secret sports link.

90
00:03:37,826 --> 00:03:40,554
Obviously those are contrived

91
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:42,923
and I tried to retain the recovery

92
00:03:42,923 --> 00:03:44,073
to a small number of words

93
00:03:44,073 --> 00:03:46,026
to make this example workable.

94
00:03:46,026 --> 00:03:47,928
In practice we need thousands

95
00:03:47,928 --> 00:03:48,896
of such messages

96
00:03:48,896 --> 00:03:50,497
to get good information.

97
00:03:50,497 --> 00:03:52,399
Play sports today.

98
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:54,368
Went play sports.

99
00:03:54,368 --> 00:03:56,803
Secret sports event.

100
00:03:56,803 --> 00:03:59,909
Sport is today.

101
00:03:59,909 --> 00:04:02,843
Sport costs money.

102
00:04:02,843 --> 00:04:06,246
My first quiz is

103
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:08,582
What is the size of the vocabulary

104
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:12,331
that contains all words in these messages?

105
00:04:12,331 --> 99:59:59,999
Please enter the value in this box over here.
