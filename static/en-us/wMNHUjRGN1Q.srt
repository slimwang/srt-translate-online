1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:06,050
Let's talk about now a specific mathematical model of body reflection.

2
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:07,570
Remember before we said it comes in,

3
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:10,500
bounces around a little bit, and then scatters out.

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:15,260
Okay? So, the model we're going to talk about is called Lambertian model, or a,

5
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:16,660
it's a Lambertian BRDF, but

6
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:19,210
we'll just think of it as being a Lambertian, all right?

7
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:22,300
And we're only going to talk about the body reflection part.

8
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:25,670
And Lambert's law, Lambert being the guy who did this.

9
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:31,880
The sort of folksy way of thinking about it is, that no matter how I look at it,

10
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:36,530
no matter what direction of reflectance that I have,

11
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:39,620
it looks to be the same brightness.

12
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:43,990
That is the only thing that's going to impact this, is the incidence component

13
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:49,690
of the light, not you know, the more perpendicular the surface is

14
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:52,670
to the light source, remember the radiance and air radiance thing, right?

15
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:56,870
It gets more of the light and therefore the brightness will only be

16
00:00:56,870 --> 00:01:01,880
effected by the angle between the lig, the surface and the light source.

17
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:04,620
Now, most people, not most people,

18
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:07,970
some people will then show you a picture that looks like this.

19
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:11,290
And by the way, if the person who made this picture is listening,

20
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:13,200
I'm not saying that you didn't understand what happened.

21
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,280
I'm just going to say that most people when they see this picture

22
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:19,470
think the following, which is not true.

23
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:20,290
Okay?

24
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:22,560
What they think is that, you know,

25
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,470
depending on the light source coming in, you know,

26
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:30,240
the more, the more perpendicular it is, the more light you have reflecting out.

27
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,560
That is true, but what's drawn here is that the amount of

28
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,290
light coming out is the same in all directions.

29
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:40,225
That is just not true.

30
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:42,000
Okay?

31
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,322
By the way, I want to thank Berthold Torn,

32
00:01:44,322 --> 00:01:47,483
who by the way invented the shape from shading problems and

33
00:01:47,483 --> 00:01:51,032
most other computer vision problems way back in like the 70s and

34
00:01:51,032 --> 00:01:54,991
80s, because I took my first computer vision course and he made a big deal.

35
00:01:54,991 --> 00:01:57,200
And you see that Berthold, I was paying attention.
