1
00:00:00,563 --> 00:00:02,004
So let's take a look and see how our

2
00:00:02,004 --> 00:00:04,267
Jersey Square team is doing in tinkering out

3
00:00:04,267 --> 00:00:06,495
their revenue streams, that is how much

4
00:00:06,495 --> 00:00:08,882
money each segment is willing to pay

5
00:00:08,882 --> 00:00:12,035
and how would they like to pay this amount.

6
00:00:12,035 --> 00:00:14,265
So what they discovered as we found out earlier

7
00:00:14,265 --> 00:00:16,209
is that they have two customer segments

8
00:00:16,209 --> 00:00:18,879
Sport Jersey Owners and Single Game Attendees

9
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:22,319
and as you will think that the Single Game Attendees

10
00:00:22,319 --> 00:00:25,642
would actually like to pay per rental, that is

11
00:00:25,642 --> 00:00:30,128
you are going to rent a jersey for one-time use

12
00:00:30,128 --> 00:00:33,182
from Jersey Square but the people who already own

13
00:00:33,182 --> 00:00:36,634
Sport Jerseys kind of like the idea of an annual

14
00:00:36,634 --> 00:00:39,887
subscription and now getting out of the building

15
00:00:39,887 --> 00:00:41,790
they actually talk to enough customers

16
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:44,540
and have enough data to realize that these

17
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:48,893
Sports Jersey owners would pay $200 a year

18
00:00:48,893 --> 00:00:51,793
to get a clean, pressed, dry-clean jersey

19
00:00:51,793 --> 00:00:55,245
for each game. It isn't clear yet

20
00:00:55,245 --> 00:00:57,278
in their customer discovery process,

21
00:00:57,278 --> 00:00:59,407
how much the Single Game Attendees will

22
00:00:59,407 --> 00:01:01,474
pay but they intend to talk to more

23
00:01:01,474 --> 00:01:05,000
customers and fill in that data.
