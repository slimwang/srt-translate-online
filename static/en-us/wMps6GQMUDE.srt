1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:04,544
By providing the smart connection to
the rest of the world while respecting

2
00:00:04,544 --> 00:00:08,159
the user's attention,
Android Wear feels personal and global.

3
00:00:08,159 --> 00:00:13,395
It's simple and smart, and
it's unobtrusive and ever-ready.

4
00:00:13,395 --> 00:00:16,610
Now applications that represent
the following principles

5
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:21,190
will feel most at home in
the overall Android Wear experience.

6
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:25,700
Wearable apps are aware of
the user's context, their time,

7
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:28,330
location, and physical activity.

8
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:32,240
Now the apps use this information
to insert cards into the stream

9
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,910
when they become relevant.

10
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:38,405
This makes Android Wear timely,
relevant, and very specific.

11
00:00:38,405 --> 00:00:42,484
A classic wristwatch is designed to let
you see the time in a split second and

12
00:00:42,484 --> 00:00:44,246
get on with what you were doing.

13
00:00:44,246 --> 00:00:46,590
And it should be the same for
Android Wear.

14
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:50,400
The less time it takes to use your
software, the more time the user can be

15
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:54,860
present in whatever they're doing,
and the more overall value they get.

16
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:58,580
Android wear is fast,
sharp, and immediate.

17
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:00,600
Remember what we looked
at just a moment ago.

18
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,830
The wearable can talk to the user, and
the user can ask things of the wearable.

19
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:08,470
Now you can visualize this much
like a personal assistant.

20
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:11,052
It knows you and your preferences.

21
00:01:11,052 --> 00:01:14,655
It'll only interrupts you when
absolutely necessary, and

22
00:01:14,655 --> 00:01:17,990
it's always on hand to
provide a ready answer.

23
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:21,920
Android Wear is helpful,
it's respectful, and it's responsive.

24
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,520
Android Wear focuses on
simple interactions,

25
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:28,870
only requiring input by the user
when absolutely necessary.

26
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:32,517
Most inputs are based around
touch swipes and voice.

27
00:01:32,517 --> 00:01:36,750
And inputs requiring fine-grained
finger movements are to be avoided.

28
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:40,700
The Android Wear is gestural,
simple, and fast.

29
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:45,110
Now keep these in mind as you dream
up your Android Wear experience.

30
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:46,290
As with everything here,

31
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:49,320
