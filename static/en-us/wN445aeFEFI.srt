1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:03,494
So, this seems really brain dead. And before we go further on this, we should do

2
00:00:03,494 --> 00:00:07,360
a sanity check of whether this is actually practical. For a human, it certainly

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:10,512
wouldn't be. If the dates are a few years apart, you wouldn't want to count

4
00:00:10,512 --> 00:00:14,302
every day. But what about a computer. So the question is roughly how long do you

5
00:00:14,302 --> 00:00:18,130
think it would take, using this brain dead approach, to count the number of days

6
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:22,613
in a hundred years between December 12, 1912. And December 12, 2012. So here are

7
00:00:22,613 --> 00:00:26,514
the choices. A few nano seconds, that's a billionth of a second, a few

8
00:00:26,514 --> 00:00:30,999
milliseconds, that's a thousandth of a second, a few seconds, a few minutes, a

9
00:00:30,999 --> 00:00:34,272
few hours, or way, way too long. This requires a little bit of guessing or

10
00:00:34,272 --> 00:00:37,103
thought but I think you should know enough to be able to get the correct answer.
