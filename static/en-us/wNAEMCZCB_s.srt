1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The answer is what we have to pass in is the start state--

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
you've got to know where you're starting from, a successor function--

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
you have to know where you can get to from the start state,

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
and a goal function--you have to know when you're done applying successors.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
That's it. We don't need to pass in any other actions or states or paths,

6
00:00:18,000 --> 99:59:59,999
because those can all be generated from these three.
