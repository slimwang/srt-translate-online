1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Now I want to gather a little bit more data,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
and here, again, there is no right or wrong answer

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
even though the interface may tell you

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
that your answer was right or wrong,

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I just want to do this sort of as a sociological experiment

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
to see where people are.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
So just tell me what your crossover point is.

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Again, there is no right or wrong answer,

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
but what's the number of dollars--

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
or euros, if you prefer that--at which you'd be indifferent

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
between accepting this gamble and holding?

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
And put that in as an integer number,

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
not the number of millions.

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
So, if your crossover point is 1 million,

15
00:00:34,000 --> 99:59:59,999
write 1 million here, don't write 1.
