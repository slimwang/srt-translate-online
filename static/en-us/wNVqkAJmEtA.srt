00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:04,350
In this lesson, we're going to take a
look at the various kinds of statistics

2
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:07,689
that we can take on time series data.

3
00:00:07,689 --> 00:00:10,430
Let's start first with
global statistics.

4
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:18,620
Consider our trusty data frame DF1 with
columns for SPY, XOM, Google, and Gold.

5
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:21,330
We can take the mean

6
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:26,610
of each of these columns very
simply with a statement like this.

7
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:29,980
This statement will take
the mean of each column and

8
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:35,125
put it in the appropriate location
of a new one-dimensional or

9
00:00:35,125 --> 00:00:37,900
row-wise of the array.

10
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:40,890
Now because this is a data frame,
and remember,

11
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:45,930
a data frame augments NumPy and
provides a lot more functionality.

12
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:50,140
It's sort of in the array on steroids.

13
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:54,670
Now we get lots and lots of
functions we can access in this way.

14
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:58,490
We already mentioned mean in
addition to mean we've got median,

15
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:01,603
standard deviation, sum, prod, mode.

16
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:08,670
All together there's at least 33 global
statistics you can compute in this way.

17
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:10,910
And they're always adding more.

18
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:12,600
Let me hand it over to Dave and

19
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,990
she's going to show you
how to do this in code.
