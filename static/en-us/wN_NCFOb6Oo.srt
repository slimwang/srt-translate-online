00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:05,284
Let's get back to our original circle with a radius of 50 units. Here's the

2
00:00:05,284 --> 00:00:10,076
circle, and then this is the center of the circle, 0,0. It's at the origin.

3
00:00:10,076 --> 00:00:14,900
Now, not every single circle we encounter will be centered at the origin. Let's

4
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:19,235
try and move this one. Say we wanted to move the center 20 units to the right,

5
00:00:19,235 --> 00:00:25,009
to this point. This means if we move the center 20 units to the right. Then

6
00:00:25,009 --> 00:00:30,195
every other point on the graph must also move 20 units to the right. What would

7
00:00:30,195 --> 00:00:35,470
be the coordinates of these four points if we move them 20 units to the right?
