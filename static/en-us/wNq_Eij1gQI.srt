00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,424
So how do neurons send signals to and from the brain? Well let's take the

2
00:00:04,424 --> 00:00:08,026
example that you have a bee flying around your head. You either see it or you

3
00:00:08,026 --> 00:00:11,534
hear it. Your sensory neurons pick up this information and send it to your

4
00:00:11,534 --> 00:00:16,515
brain to be processed. Then your motor neurons take this signal and send it to

5
00:00:16,515 --> 00:00:19,536
your muscles and that allows you to swat the bee away or get up and run,

6
00:00:19,536 --> 00:00:24,500
whatever you're going to do. Now how these messages are sent are because of an

7
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:28,950
action potential. Now an action potential is an explosion of electricity that

8
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:34,280
sends information down an axon away from the cell body. When the electrical

9
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:37,630
voltage of a neuron reaches a threshold level, that's when the action potential

10
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:42,160
fires. Now this electrical impulse triggers a chemical release and that's how

11
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,988
neurons communicate with each other. There's a lot more details that go into

12
00:00:45,988 --> 00:00:48,440
these. So I'm going to let Greg explain it to you a little better.
