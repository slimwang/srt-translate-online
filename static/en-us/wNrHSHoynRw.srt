1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,450
Now that we have seen what
a relational database looks like,

2
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:07,530
we said it's a collection
of relations or tables, and

3
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:12,310
we looked at a table, and tuples, and
at the various attributes and so on.

4
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:16,610
So, what kind of operations
can you perform on tables?

5
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:18,890
Of course you can create a table.

6
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:23,420
We're talking about selecting certain
information out of a table of relations.

7
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:27,106
So for example, I can say everybody
who is in a certain department,

8
00:00:27,106 --> 00:00:29,903
we can read that information
out of that relation.

9
00:00:29,903 --> 00:00:32,944
That's what a query selection will do,
and

10
00:00:32,944 --> 00:00:35,911
we going to see examples
of that will return.

11
00:00:35,911 --> 00:00:40,098
So you can select information, you
can of course insert tuples, or rows,

12
00:00:40,098 --> 00:00:43,090
you can update attribute
values that are in there.

13
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:47,150
You can actually perform joint
operations across multiple tables and,

14
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:50,410
of course, you can delete tuples,
delete tables and

15
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:53,890
eventually delete a database,
that may be a collection of tables.

16
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:58,010
You know, create, delete are sort of
similar to what we have seen before, for

17
00:00:58,010 --> 00:00:59,210
example, files.

18
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:03,850
But some of the things like select,
insert, join, these are kind of

19
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:08,880
new to how you can manipulate and access
data that is stored in a data base.

20
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,990
What I do for,
we said we write queries or

21
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:16,980
programs to access data that is stored
in a data base and those programs or

22
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:20,580
queries can actually make use of these
operations that we're talking about.

23
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:25,570
So this is saying select, star means
everything, so all attribute values.

24
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:30,150
From the employee table that we
had where the department ID is 15.

25
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:34,320
So we are saying basically tell us,
give us the information about

26
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,100
every employee who works in
department that has ID 15.

27
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:42,370
So this is an example of how
I might access information

28
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:46,180
that is told in the relation or
the table that we just saw.

29
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:50,990
And this is an example of a read query,
because all we're doing is reading

30
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:54,210
selected pieces of information
that is there in that table.

31
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:57,660
And returning that to whoever
is making this request.

32
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:00,100
So actually if you are going to run this

33
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:02,970
query against the table
that we just saw.

34
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:08,860
You'll see that the department ID is
15 for two employees, Robin and Cody.

35
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:12,680
So we are going to get the tuples for
Robin and Cody.

36
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:17,030
In response to, when we run this query
against the database that we have.

37
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:20,710
So selection has happened because,
of course, we had a lot more employees.

38
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:24,240
Now we're only selecting the ones who
work in the department with ID 15,

39
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,680
who happen to be these two people.

40
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,450
And these are return of the programs,

41
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:31,250
the queries that return in a language,
a query language.

42
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:35,210
We talked about SQL before, and
we'll see some more examples of that.

43
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:38,170
But basically these programs or
queries that we're talking about in

44
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:42,200
this language allow you to
use these basic operations.

45
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:45,460
That you can perform on
tables of relations and

46
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:49,140
you can use these operations in
the programs that you write or

47
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:53,310
the queries that you submit to access
the data that is of interest to you.
