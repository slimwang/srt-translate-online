1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,399
Now, what do we learn from this? It seems like there may be some serious problems with this grammatical approach to language.

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:12,066
And I want you to tell me which of these you think are serious problems, true or false.

3
00:00:12,067 --> 00:00:21,999
So, one issue is, is it easy to write a grammar that will emit good parses accidentally? Tell me if that's true or false.

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,732
Is it easy to write a grammar that will include spurious parses, or bad parses?

5
00:00:28,733 --> 00:00:38,932
Is that true or false? And trees are unobservable compared to words, which are observable. Is that a problem, true or false?

6
00:00:38,933 --> 00:00:45,099
And then let's look at some possible solutions. Now, one possibility would be,

7
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:52,699
if we have too many parses to deal with, and we don't know which ones should be the right ones,

8
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:56,966
maybe we should associate a probability with each tree.

9
00:00:56,967 --> 00:01:00,499
Is that a good idea? True or false?

10
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:08,899
Secondly, if words are put together that don't seem to make sense, maybe we should bring back word association statistics,

11
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:16,166
like we had in the Markov models, and incorporate them into the tree models? Is that a good idea, true or false?

12
00:01:16,167 --> 00:01:23,866
And finally, if we have the problem of ambiguity of our trees, maybe we should make the grammar unambiguous.

13
00:01:23,867 --> 00:01:29,599
After all, that's what we do with our programming languages. We make our programming languages unambiguous,

14
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:39,299
so that, for example, A plus B times C, we know, is parsed as if it had parentheses around the B and C,

15
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:42,532
and is not ambiguous as to whether it could be parsed the other way.

16
00:01:42,533 --> 00:01:48,600
Would it be a good idea to make our grammar unambiguous?
