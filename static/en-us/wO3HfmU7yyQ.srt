1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:04,000
In this case the correct answer is B but
let's see why.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,430
FirebaseListAdapter and

3
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:10,360
FirebaseArray are providing the logic
to receive events from the database.

4
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:12,250
Answer A doesn't make any sense.

5
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:16,030
The FirebaseArray is stored at
a variable called M snapshots

6
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:18,330
within the FirebaseListAdapter.

7
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:21,870
As such, it's encapsulated within
the FirebaseListAdapter and there are no

8
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:26,210
methods in FirebaseListAdapter that
allow you to write to its contents.

9
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:27,440
So you or

10
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:31,850
your app's code cannot actually change
anything in FirebaseArray directly.

11
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:35,680
Because of that, you manually removing
ShoppingLIst from FirebaseArray is just

12
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,420
something you can't do.

13
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:39,650
C is incorrect for a similar reason.

14
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:42,515
Again you can't manually remove
things from the FirebaseArray.

15
00:00:42,515 --> 00:00:47,300
Now the FirebaseArray does have a bunch
of on child listener methods and

16
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:50,570
this is because it implements
the child event listener interface.

17
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:53,410
Which reactively changes
the underlying array when the Firebase

18
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:54,600
database changes.

19
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,300
Which is what this could
connection here is showing.

20
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:00,100
So, if you were to manually remove
the shopping list from the Firebase

21
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:04,910
database, that removal is automatically
pushed to the Firebase array.

22
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:07,190
Now Inter d is just a little bit funky.

23
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:09,000
While Firebase does make
a lot of stuff happen for

24
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,630
you automatically, If you want something
to be removed from the database,

25
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:15,950
you can't just sit around
hoping that it'll happen.

26
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:18,250
If you're using your app,
and let's say J.P.

27
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:22,540
deletes something, it could seem like
magic that both your database data and

28
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:25,290
your Firebase list adapter just so
happen to update.

29
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:26,760
But ultimately somebody,

30
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:30,680
somewhere is using the app to manually
make a change to the Firebase database.

31
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,600
So D really isn't a correct answer.
