Here are the equations for each of the pieces of our line over here. The first

2
00:00:03,942 --> 00:00:08,164
one was pretty easy to figure out, it's just y equals 0. Since this is just a

3
00:00:08,164 --> 00:00:12,800
horizontal line at well, y equals 0. For each of these other three equations, I

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:16,440
started out using point-slope form and then transformed to have equations in

5
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:20,678
slope-intercept form. Over here on the graph, I wrote the tax rates

6
00:00:20,678 --> 00:00:24,123
corresponding to each of the brackets to make reminding myself of the slope of

7
00:00:24,123 --> 00:00:28,803
each line really easy. Then I just picked a point for each line that was easy

8
00:00:28,803 --> 00:00:33,414
to identify. Plugging in all of that information gave us these equations. For

9
00:00:33,414 --> 00:00:39,259
the lowest bracket, we have y equals 0.1x minus 500. For the middle one we have

10
00:00:39,259 --> 00:00:44,535
y equals 0.2x minus 2000. And for the highest bracket, or at least the highest

11
00:00:44,535 --> 00:00:48,383
one shown here, we have y equals 0.3x minus 5500.
