00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:03,200
Using the skills we've covered
in this lesson you should now be

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:07,550
well equipped to implement a solid
focused strategy in your application.

3
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:10,740
The next step is to take all these
various interactive controls that we've

4
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:14,280
been working with and
start to infuse them with some meaning.

5
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:17,850
For instance, when a screen reader
lands on your custom radio buttons,

6
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:21,230
how is it going to tell the user that
these are in fact radio buttons.

7
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:23,460
And not just a bunch of divs.

8
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:25,800
For that, we're going to need
to learn about semantics.

9
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,195
And I'm going to turn it over to
Alice to tell you all about it.
