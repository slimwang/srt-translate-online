1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,900
For the first fraction we'll have s squared for a numerator and 2 k s squared

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:08,340
for the denominator. For the second fraction we'll have k for a numerator and 2

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:12,622
k s squared for the denominator. And now we're ready to add these two fractions

4
00:00:12,622 --> 00:00:16,290
together. We add the numerators together, just like from before and then keep

5
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:20,178
the denominator the same. Be careful that you don't multiply these two numbers

6
00:00:20,178 --> 00:00:25,870
together. We really just have s squared plus k. We don't multiply them, since

7
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:26,793
we're adding.
