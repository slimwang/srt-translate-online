00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,791
When we factor a number, we split up the number into the product of other

2
00:00:04,791 --> 00:00:10,061
numbers. 216 can be written as 2 times 108. This number is even, so I know I can

3
00:00:10,061 --> 00:00:15,258
divide by 2. Then I just continue my process to get all the other factors. 108

4
00:00:15,258 --> 00:00:20,061
breaks down into 2 times 54, and 54 breaks down into 2 times 27. 27 isn't

5
00:00:20,061 --> 00:00:25,264
divisible by 2, but it is divisible by 3. So we have 3 times 9 is 27 and then 9

6
00:00:25,264 --> 00:00:30,690
is 3 times 3. These factors are the prime factors, because the numbers only have

7
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:35,770
two distinct factors, 1 and itself. The only factor of 2 is 2 and 1, and the

8
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:40,872
only factor of 3 is 3 and 1. We can rewrite 216 using bases and exponents. We

9
00:00:40,872 --> 00:00:46,111
know we have 2 to the third power, since we have 3 2's. And we have three to the

10
00:00:46,111 --> 00:00:50,530
third power since we have three 3s. This is the prime factorization for 216,

11
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:54,937
since the only numbers that appear here are prime factors. Use what you know

12
00:00:54,937 --> 00:00:59,467
about prime factors to figure out what's the prime factorization for 192. You

13
00:00:59,467 --> 00:01:03,883
can write your answer in this box and be sure to include the appropriate bases

14
00:01:03,883 --> 00:01:04,843
and exponents.
