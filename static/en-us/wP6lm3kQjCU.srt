00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,670
Now that you've learned the basics about drawing texts let's combine it all and

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:05,390
make a simple mean generator.

3
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:08,260
We've given you a head start with some basic HTML.

4
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:11,120
Inside this HTML, you'll find a few things but

5
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:12,470
let me point out what's important.

6
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:16,520
Here in this section of HTML we're creating the top line and

7
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:19,680
bottom line entries, which you can see right here.

8
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,110
This is where a user will be able to type in text that they want to

9
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:23,450
appear on the image.

10
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:24,570
Inside the script tag,

11
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:29,230
we'll find all the necessary components to start building the meme generator.

12
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:33,120
We can see here, in this if statement, we're getting the text that was made in

13
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,080
the top and bottom lines, and then we have this function called

14
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:40,500
redraw meme where we get the canvas and select the context like we did before.

15
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,700
After that we can see a place where your code goes.

16
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:45,630
Then we've got this save file function which is going to let us use

17
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:49,610
the toDataURL method to hopefully save our images.

18
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:53,120
Then we've got this handleFileSelect method which will help us load a file from

19
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,190
the disk as an image for the background.

20
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:59,430
But the most important thing is that your code goes within this

21
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:00,360
redrawMeme function.

22
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,690
So put together everything that you've learned so far.

23
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:03,860
Use the background image and

24
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:06,110
put some text over it to create this meme generator.

25
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:09,690
So, now that you've got the starter code for a simple meme maker,

26
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:13,490
can you use the canvas to load images with that iconic meme text?

27
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:15,370
