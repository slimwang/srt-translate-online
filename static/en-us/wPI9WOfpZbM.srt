1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,510
It's great you learn about Bayes Rule.

2
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:07,470
And one of the things you use Bayes Rule a lot for is learning from documents,

3
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:09,760
or text learning.

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:13,760
And the methods they'll tell you about is often called Naive Bayes.

5
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:15,650
It's actually a misnomer,

6
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:19,330
it's not to be naive, not as in naive as Bayes Rule itself.

7
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:20,030
But that's the name.

8
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:24,295
Okay, so you're going to exercise this later in our practice exams using

9
00:00:24,295 --> 00:00:26,230
Enron email data sets.

10
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:27,920
But I give you the gist of it.

11
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:32,619
Suppose we have two people, one is called Chris and one is called Sara.

12
00:00:32,619 --> 00:00:35,310
And both people write a lot of email and for

13
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:40,180
simplicity I'll assume that these emails only contain three words, okay?

14
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:46,190
They contain the word love, the word deal, and the word life.

15
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:48,120
Same is true about Sara.

16
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,600
Obviously people use more than three words.

17
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:54,160
But this area here is a little bit small for 30,000 words.

18
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,760
The difference of these two people Chris and

19
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,760
Sara is in the frequency at which they use those words.

20
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:02,730
And just for simplicity let's say Chris loves talking about deals.

21
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:07,410
So 80% of his words or 0.8 are deal and he talks about life and

22
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:09,730
love for a bit with 0.1 probability so

23
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:13,890
if Chris a word in email he's going to 80 percent of the time use the word

24
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:17,070
deal and ten percent of the time use the word love or life.

25
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:22,390
Sara talks more about love, a little bit about deals, .2 and about life .3.

26
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:25,300
And again that's a simplified example.

27
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:28,280
What Naive Bayes allows you to do is to determine based on

28
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:32,260
a random email who's the likely person who sent this email.

29
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:35,970
Suppose says an email that goes as follows love life, and

30
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:38,390
you don't know who sent it but you'd like to figure that out.

31
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:41,426
Then you can do the space on base form and

32
00:01:41,426 --> 00:01:48,280
suppose you leave a priori that it's 50% probability by Chris or by Sara.

33
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,550
So we'll say p of Chris equals 0.5.

34
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:52,270
That means the prior probability for

35
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:55,470
it being Chris is fifty percent and that immediately means,

36
00:01:55,470 --> 00:02:00,960
because it is one of the two, that the probability of Sara is also 0.5.

37
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,980
So if you look at this intuitively, who's more likely er,

38
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:05,110
to have written this email?

39
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:07,650
Chris or Sara?

40
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:08,490
Just check one box
