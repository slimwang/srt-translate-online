1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,460
There are two things to do.

2
00:00:01,460 --> 00:00:05,440
Your end points method need to accept
two arguments, period and name.

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:06,530
Both of them are strings, so

4
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:09,790
you have to create a new resource
container with two fields.

5
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:11,800
And then you can define
the method itself.

6
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:15,520
The request will be handled by the same
request container you just wrote.

7
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:17,800
The output will be the same hello class.

8
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,710
And the path will be greet
by period as we said.
