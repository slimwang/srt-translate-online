1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Let's go through it together, and this first one starts with a left angle bracket,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
which looks super promising, but then it has this slash

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
which we don't see reflected up here, so this one doesn't match,

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
could not have produced this sequence of 5.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Over here we have a left angle bracket, a b, a right angle bracket.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Looking great. Salvador, looking good.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Dali, looking great. Oh, yeah, this totally matches.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Down here we have almost the same sentence, but there's no space

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
between salvador and dali.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
This is very close, but instead of getting 2 separate words at the end,

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
it would break down into just one word at the end, salvadordali,

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
so this one doesn't match.

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Over here we start with a bold tag, have salvador and then dali,

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
but then we have a few more characters that aren't shown in this list of 5,

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
so this doesn't match exactly.

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Here we have salvador followed by the bold tag.

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
That's getting the order wrong, and the order of this breakdown is really going to matter.

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
We really need to know the order of words in a sentence.

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Super important, it is.

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Finally, over here we start with bold, and we have salvador dali again.

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
This looks great. No problems there.

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Notice the spacing was a little different.

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Here we had a space between the bold tag and salvador.

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Here we had kind of a space over here.

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
These spaces don't matter very much.

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Salvador Dali was a Spanish artist famous for his surrealist paintings,

27
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
probably most famous for painting The Persistence of--

28
00:01:27,000 --> 99:59:59,999
I can't remember. Let's just go on.
