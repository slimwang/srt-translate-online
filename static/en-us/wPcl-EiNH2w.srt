00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:03,370
In the break point debugging scene,
we currently have way too

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:06,430
many spiders being created
when a user taps the screen.

3
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:09,600
But there's another more pressing
problem that I want you to solve using

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,020
break points.

5
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:14,425
If we tap the settings
icon from the main view,

6
00:00:14,425 --> 00:00:18,335
we should be able to set the spider type
that we want to spawn on the screen.

7
00:00:18,335 --> 00:00:20,645
However, if I tap any
of the spider icons or

8
00:00:20,645 --> 00:00:24,475
even the back arrow here,
the settings view doesn't dismiss.

9
00:00:24,475 --> 00:00:25,225
We're just stuck.

10
00:00:25,225 --> 00:00:28,895
I want you to solve this
problem using breakpoints.

11
00:00:28,895 --> 00:00:29,965
As you work through the problem,

12
00:00:29,965 --> 00:00:34,110
write the steps that you take
to debug it in this text box.

13
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:36,340
And when you're done you can
compare your steps with mine.

14
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:41,360
Now while you may not go the same
way solving the problem that I did,

15
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,850
it's always really useful to
see other's perspectives for

16
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:44,970
solving the same problem.
