00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:05,750
Let's do one more exercise on the same problem. Note that,

2
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:09,700
I have added one more rule into the procedural knowledge. This is

3
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:14,565
the rule that was the result of chunking. If two operators are suggested, and

4
00:00:14,565 --> 00:00:17,535
throw-fast-ball operator suggested, and the batter is Parra.

5
00:00:17,535 --> 00:00:23,070
Then dismiss the throw-fast-ball operator. Okay, given these rules and the same

6
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:27,420
situation, what do you think will be the operator that will be selected?
