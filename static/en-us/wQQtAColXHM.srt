1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,593
The answer is that base 6, and
base 16 would've worked as well.

2
00:00:04,593 --> 00:00:09,368
The key is to avoid carrying, so that
the effects of including a number on one

3
00:00:09,368 --> 00:00:11,990
column, never spill over into another.

4
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:13,115
2 and 3 won't work.

5
00:00:13,115 --> 00:00:15,595
6 and 16 on the other hand do work,

6
00:00:15,595 --> 00:00:19,960
since there is a total of
at most five in any column.

7
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:21,074
Actually, base four and

8
00:00:21,074 --> 00:00:24,890
base five work as well, thought the
argument is a little more complicated.

9
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:26,790
I'll leave it to you to
work out as an exercise.
