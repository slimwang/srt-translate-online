1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,550
So I just snuck one past you there.

2
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:07,430
Okay. We said the magnitude of the noise is determined by sigma.

3
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:08,270
Fine that's great.

4
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:13,190
In fact, we could just look at the noise function itself, right.

5
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:14,280
So don't add in the original image.

6
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,280
Just look at the noise function.

7
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:20,650
But we can't do that just yet until we make a decision, and the reason is this.

8
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:22,580
What's the mean of the noise.

9
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:23,770
Megan?

10
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:24,300
>> Zero.

11
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:25,350
>> Very good.

12
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:27,500
So that means some of the values are going to be what?

13
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:30,360
Positive, some of the values are going to be negative.

14
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:36,750
How do we look at a picture that has positives and negatives in it?

15
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:39,000
Right? If we said zero was black and

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,530
one was white, or zero was black and 255 was white, so how do we do this?

17
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:46,960
Well, the mistake is saying that zero is black.

18
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:47,760
Okay?

19
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,840
We're going to say, look, we'll map some minimum value to black,

20
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:56,270
some maximum value to white, and we'll distribute them in between.

21
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:59,380
In particular, zero should be what color?

22
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:01,890
What color do you think zero should be, between black and white?

23
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:04,810
What comes between black and white in the universe?

24
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:06,320
Grey. All right?

25
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,750
So let's suppose we have values that you know,

26
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:12,460
go from minus 20 to plus 20 in our image,

27
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:16,670
well we can make minus 20 black, plus 20 white and, and zero would be grey.

28
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:20,080
And if we did that, it would look like this.

29
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:24,650
So here we're showing you images of Gaussian noise.

30
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:28,610
Just the noise, So if there's a very small sigma, so

31
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:31,360
remember sigma's up here, so a very small sigma.

32
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,190
All right?

33
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:36,280
You can barely see that this is anything but a constant grey.

34
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:40,310
As we let sigma get bigger and bigger and bigger, you start to see more and

35
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:41,340
more speckle.

36
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:42,970
And that's the effect of sigma so

37
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:45,440
it's just a noise function being added to an image.
