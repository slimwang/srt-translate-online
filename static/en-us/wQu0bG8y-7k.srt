We can put all of our knowledge together about radicals, factors, variables and

2
00:00:04,176 --> 00:00:09,300
even exponents to simplify something like this. Try simplifying each of these

3
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:13,600
cube roots and then see if you can subtract the radicals. Be sure that if you

4
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:17,655
pull out any factor, you multiply it by what's out in front. This one's pretty

5
00:00:17,655 --> 00:00:21,750
tough so take your time on it and feel free to play around with the math. Good

00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:22,623
luck.
