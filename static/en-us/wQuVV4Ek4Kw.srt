00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:05,640
This argument is x squared minus 2x, and this argument is 15. Great thinking if

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:11,289
you got these. We know this argument is x squared minus 2x, since we just

3
00:00:11,289 --> 00:00:16,470
multiply x minus 2 times x. We multiply the arguments, when we add two

4
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:22,414
logarithms together that have the same base. So x times x equals x squared and

5
00:00:22,414 --> 00:00:27,471
x times negative 2 is negative 2x. For the right hand side we're going to

6
00:00:27,471 --> 00:00:31,188
multiple 6 times 5 to get 30 and then we'll divide by 2, since for subtracting

7
00:00:31,188 --> 00:00:39,298
a logarithm. So 30 divided by 2 equals 15. Remember when we add logs, we

8
00:00:39,298 --> 00:00:44,050
multiple the arguments and when we subtract, we divide by that number. This is

9
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:47,969
how we get a number of 15 here.
