00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:04,643
The equation we just came up with, y equals x over 10 minus 15, and the one we

2
00:00:04,643 --> 00:00:08,877
started out with, y equals 10x plus 150, are related to one another in a

3
00:00:08,877 --> 00:00:14,584
special way. To figure out what that is, I think it would be great if we

4
00:00:14,584 --> 00:00:18,618
plotted both of them. To get to that point, though, we need to know, well, some

5
00:00:18,618 --> 00:00:23,034
points on each line. Please fill out each of these x y charts to give us some

6
00:00:23,034 --> 00:00:24,849
of those points.
