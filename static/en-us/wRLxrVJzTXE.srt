1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,360
The next step now, is to have
a way to turn off the recording

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,500
once you've started recording something.

3
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:07,590
For that, we will need, you guessed it.

4
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:08,750
Our stop recording button.

5
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:13,170
We'll also need an IP-action
from the stop recording button

6
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:15,000
to the view controller code.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,130
Make sure you are on the assistant
view with the storyboard and

8
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:20,500
the view controller files open.

9
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,850
Control drag from this button
into the view controller and

10
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:25,770
select the option to
create an IB action.

11
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:29,140
Let's name this IB action
stopped recording.

12
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:34,850
In this action, let's add a line to
print out when this button was pressed

13
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:36,160
by adding the following code.

14
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:39,450
We should be able to run
the pitch perfect app now.

15
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:41,780
And if we press the stop
recording button,

16
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:45,570
we'll see our caveman debugging
output in the Xcode console.

17
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:46,180
Let's give it a try.

18
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:48,110
We're almost there.

19
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:51,560
The next step is to add the constraints
to our new label and button and

20
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:54,960
then to wire up some IBOutlets so
that the Recording and

21
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,310
Stop Recording buttons are not
both enabled at the same time.
