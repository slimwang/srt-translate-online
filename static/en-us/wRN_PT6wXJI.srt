00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,678
In this exercise, you'll start with a directional light pointing at the back of

2
00:00:02,678 --> 00:00:06,314
the bird. It doesn't look very good. I want you to hook up a slider to the

3
00:00:06,314 --> 00:00:09,672
light. Use the slider to vary the light's x and z direction by the cosine and

4
00:00:09,672 --> 00:00:13,696
sine of the angle. In other words, x is related to cosine, z is related to

5
00:00:13,696 --> 00:00:18,450
sine. And by the way, save your solution. You'll reuse it in the next exercise.

6
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:21,115
When you've got the code running, the program should look like this as you vary

7
00:00:21,115 --> 00:00:25,910
the angle. Also don't forget the cosine and sine want to be fed radians, not

8
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:27,210
degrees.
