1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
And so we're in the last piece in detail is what gain are you creating.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
What are the benefits the customer expects, desires or surprise about.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
So again you're going to start with your hypothesis--"What makes the customer happy,"

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
or is that you're going to create savings and time or money and effort.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Is this a product that delights them because the outcome is better than you could even imagine,

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
better quality, or more of something or less of something they're going to like.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Does it just simply outperform current solutions that delighted customer.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Does it make your job or life easier, or does it create positive consequences

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
that a customer desires.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Again, it could be a social consequence for a need or it could be a business consequence--

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
they get more sales, etc.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
And so much like thinking through pain, you'll start with a set of hypothesis,

13
00:00:51,000 --> 99:59:59,999
but the only way to understand this is outside the building in front of lots of customers.
