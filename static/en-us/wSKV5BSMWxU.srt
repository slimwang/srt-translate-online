Now I want to mention two less frequently used UML diagram types.

2
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:10,500
One is the interaction overview diagram. It's a kind of activity diagram,

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:14,880
where the nodes in the diagram correspond to lower level interaction diagrams

4
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:19,550
which could be of any sort, sequence, communication, interaction overview, and

5
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:20,590
timing diagrams.

6
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:25,270
In the diagram example, the term ref denotes a specific interaction occurrence.
