1
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:04,230
Another issue we come across when
we're working with data is finding

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:06,300
extra characters in fields.

3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:10,030
This could be anything,
like currency symbols or number signs.

4
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:13,900
We'd need to remove these before
changing between field types.

5
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:17,890
For example, we might need to
change strings to number types so

6
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:19,740
we can do arithmetic.

7
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:23,350
We may be working with fields with
strange symbols in them because they

8
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:27,820
come from some system that automatically
embeds these symbols in the field.

9
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:31,660
The easiest way to fix
up these types of errors

10
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:33,520
is to simply get rid of the characters.

11
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:39,300
In this session, we're going to look at
three different problems where we find

12
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,420
extra characters in fields.

13
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:45,015
In the first situation,
we've got quotation marks around names,

14
00:00:45,015 --> 00:00:46,925
which we need to remove.

15
00:00:46,925 --> 00:00:49,945
The second field has
a letter after the zip code.

16
00:00:49,945 --> 00:00:50,921
And then third,

17
00:00:50,921 --> 00:00:54,974
a currency symbol at the beginning
of the number in the amount field.

18
00:00:54,974 --> 00:00:56,559
