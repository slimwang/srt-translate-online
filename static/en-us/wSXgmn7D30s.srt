00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,740
In this lesson, you'll learn how to
use an ARIMA model, which stands for

2
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:06,440
Auto Regressive Integrated
Moving Average.

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:09,940
I know, it sounds intimidating, but
we'll take it step by step, and

4
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:11,090
by the end, you'll be a pro.

5
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:15,340
Your first step to becoming a pro will
be look at a process that transforms

6
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:18,030
a time series into
a more workable format.

7
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:20,790
Then we'll discuss each component
of the model in detail, and

8
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:25,040
finally, we'll go through the process
to build a model and make a forecast.

9
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:28,850
There are two types of ARIMA models,
non-seasonal and seasonal.

10
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:30,810
We'll first discuss
non seasonal ARIMA and

11
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:32,381
then move into seasonal ARIMA later on.

12
00:00:32,381 --> 00:00:35,480
Non-seasonal ARIMA
models forecast future

13
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:39,553
points based upon the construction of
three components, an autoregressive, AR,

14
00:00:39,553 --> 00:00:44,950
a differencing, I, and
a moving average, MA, component.
