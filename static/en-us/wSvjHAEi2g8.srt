1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:03,780
And the answer should be 8. There are 3 odd rows and each odd row has 2

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:09,587
circles, so we get 6 circles from odd rows. And there are 2 even rows and each

3
00:00:09,587 --> 00:00:14,545
of those has 1 circle, so we add 2. In general, that would be the number of odd

4
00:00:14,545 --> 00:00:18,915
rows times the number of circles per odd row. Plus the number of even rows

5
00:00:18,915 --> 00:00:23,843
times the circles per even row. You'll want to use this equation in your

6
00:00:23,843 --> 00:00:25,159
program.
