[Norvig] Now, I said that with the correct shuffle algorithm,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
the Algorithm P, every permutation of the deck has an equal probability.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
The next question is, for the teacher's algorithm

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
does every permutation have an equal chance? What do you think?

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Yes, they're all the same, it just takes longer to get them;

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
no, some of them will be different, have a different probability;

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
or no, some will have a 0 probability,

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
that there will be some permutations that it's impossible for the teacher's shuffle to generate.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Tell me which you think.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
This is a hard question. It takes some analysis to be able to figure it out.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
You may be able to tell just by looking at the algorithm,

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
or you may want to write some code to analyze what the situation is.
