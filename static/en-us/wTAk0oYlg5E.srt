1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,160
Big O notation is the final tool for analyzing algorithms

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:07,730
that you need to know about before we can analyze Alice algorithm.

3
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:10,830
As we've just seen even talking about worst-case running time

4
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:13,660
can be a bit tricky if we're trying to be very precise.

5
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:18,620
We have to identify the worst-case input in detail, which can be counter intuitive

6
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:21,180
and then work through a lot of different cases.

7
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:26,520
And also as we noticed it's annoying to have to count every single step an algorithm makes.

8
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:32,020
So for example if you have two algorithms and one had a running time of 2n²+23 time steps

9
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:38,160
and the other one had 2n²+27 time steps, you wouldn't really care about the 23 or the 27.

10
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,160
You would say that essentially they have the same running time.

11
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:45,040
So we are going to introduce a huge simplification

12
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:48,540
to stating running times and that is called Big O-notation.

13
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:51,920
If you've had an algorithm course before, you should already be familiar with this

14
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,010
but we'll review it here just to make sure you understand.

15
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:59,170
So let's say we have two algorithms, algorithm A and algorithm B,

16
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:04,870
and algorithm A has a running time 3n²-n+10 for an input of size n,

17
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:12,250
and algorithm B has a running time of 2^n-50n+256.

18
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:18,220
So what I would like you think about is which of these two algorithms you would prefer

19
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:23,100
if you don't know anything about the input other than that you're going to get different sizes.

20
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:27,690
So no other structural assumptions or anything else that you know.

21
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:31,510
And I would like you to check this box if you think it's algorithm A that if you take

22
00:01:31,510 --> 99:59:59,999
in general and this box if you think it's algorithm B.
