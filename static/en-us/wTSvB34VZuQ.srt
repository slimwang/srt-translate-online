To understand more deeply the properties of means and analysis,

2
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:10,406
let us look at another, slightly more complicated example. In this example,

3
00:00:10,406 --> 00:00:14,660
there are four blocks instead of the three in the previous example. A, B,

4
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:18,940
C, D. In the initial state, the blocks are arranged as shown here.

5
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:23,240
The goal state is shown here on the right. The four blocks are arranged in

6
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:28,030
a particular order. Now if you compare the configuration of blocks on

7
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:32,590
the left with the configuration of blocks on the right, in the goal state,

8
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:37,590
you can see there are three differences. First, A is on Table,

9
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:43,980
where A is on B here. B is on C. That's not a difference. C is on Table.

10
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:50,030
C is on D here, D's on B, D's on Table here. So there are three differences.

11
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:55,350
So, this is a heuristic measure of the difference between the initial state and

12
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:57,280
the goal state. Once again,

13
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,790
we'll assume that the AI agent can move only one block at a time.

14
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:05,590
Given the specification of the problem, what states are possible

15
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:10,760
from the initial state? Please write down your answers in these boxes.
