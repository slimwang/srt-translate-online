1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,590
Now that you know how to create
an arbitrarily complex nested layout,

2
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:07,330
it's important to understand
that they don't come for free.

3
00:00:07,339 --> 00:00:11,655
Once again, the resource constraints 
of the platform spoil the party.

4
00:00:11,655 --> 00:00:14,951
Inflating complex layouts 
can be expensive,

5
00:00:14,951 --> 00:00:19,427
potentially impacting the performance 
and responsiveness of your app.

6
00:00:19,427 --> 00:00:22,135
So there are two good 
rules of thumb to help.

7
00:00:22,135 --> 00:00:27,790
First, keep your layout shallow and wide, 
rather than deep and narrow.

8
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:31,820
That means you're better off
with more siblings and fewer children.

9
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:35,000
Because it's never as simple as that, 
you also want to avoid

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,820
having excessive Views.

11
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:39,953
In the most general terms, 
that means your activities'

12
00:00:39,953 --> 00:00:43,466
full hierarchy should never have 
more than ten nested Views

13
00:00:43,466 --> 00:00:46,110
or over 80 Views in total.

14
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:48,590
That probably sounds like a lot, 
but let's open up

15
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:51,350
the Hierarchy Viewer tool
in Android Studio

16
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:53,470
and see just how quickly
that can add up.
