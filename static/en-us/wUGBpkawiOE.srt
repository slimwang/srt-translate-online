00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:05,350
I've presented a very basic introduction
to FHIR which is still very much

2
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:06,890
in development and testing.

3
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:11,490
The standard encompasses many
other issues including what

4
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:13,990
values termed value sets

5
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:17,630
are allowed to define structured
data elements within resources.

6
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,280
I encourage you to explore further and

7
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:25,010
stay up to date as
the standard develops.

8
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:29,807
Recently for example, an article
appeared proposing three new FHIR

9
00:00:29,807 --> 00:00:33,212
resources to represent
patients genomic data.

10
00:00:33,212 --> 00:00:37,520
According to Grahame Grieve, a key
challenge facing the FHIR standards

11
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:42,182
development effort is achieving the
right balance between functionality and

12
00:00:42,182 --> 00:00:43,040
complexity.

13
00:00:44,055 --> 00:00:47,970
FHIR is not intended to
represent all of healthcare.

14
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:51,130
Rather, it is intended to
contain the key resources and

15
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:55,420
details needed to represent the most
common elements of healthcare.

16
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:59,560
I've served on standard
development teams, and

17
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:03,410
it is entirely predictable that
people whose favorite use case isn't

18
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:08,260
perfectly covered will push for
inclusion of more and more detail.

19
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:11,690
Doing so clearly risks
creating the very complexity

20
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:14,280
that led to the idea of
FHIR in the first place.
