1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:04,610
So far we've discussed the structure and
purpose of standards.

2
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:07,610
The final dimension is technology.

3
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:10,854
And this is particularly
applicable to messaging standards,

4
00:00:10,854 --> 00:00:14,771
where the messages must constructed
from data standards in a manner that can

5
00:00:14,771 --> 00:00:17,299
be understood by the systems
that receive them.

6
00:00:17,299 --> 00:00:19,755
We just discussed why.

7
00:00:19,755 --> 00:00:24,710
Departments in a hospital that want to
share information with each other, so

8
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:28,020
for example, an order can flow
from the physician caring for

9
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:32,070
the patient to the lab, and
the result of the test can come back.

10
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:36,060
Messaging standards serve that purpose,
but now we're looking at

11
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:40,440
the technology in which those standards
are implemented and formatted.

12
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:45,036
Early messaging standards
were created using EDI/X12,

13
00:00:45,036 --> 00:00:48,790
a standard that evolved in other
industries to automate business

14
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:51,900
processes such as ordering,
invoicing, and payment.

15
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:56,460
EDI/X12 was developed in the early
days of computing when memory and

16
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:58,620
storage were still dear.

17
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:01,980
So it is quite cryptic and
compact as you can see here.

18
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:05,310
Note that with some effort,

19
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:10,210
we can tell that this involves
a clinical lab and a glucose test.

20
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:13,000
But most of the details are not obvious.

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:13,520
In fact,

22
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:18,420
to understand each specific field,
typically requires a reference guide.

23
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:23,330
More recently, messaging and document
standards have been developed using XML,

24
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:28,190
a modern syntax that is verbose, but
has the advantages of being more human

25
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:31,180
readable and
easily rendered in a browser.

26
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:34,690
This is the same lab test
result we just looked at.

27
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:39,446
While it's still not easy to read,
we can much more easily tell

28
00:01:39,446 --> 00:01:44,129
that it was a blood glucose level,
that its value was 182.

29
00:01:44,129 --> 00:01:46,500
It says value right there.

30
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:53,404
And we can see the normal ranges for
the test are 70 to 105.
