Just as we can change the color of an object using a texture, we can also

2
00:00:03,812 --> 00:00:07,568
change its transparency. Here's a simple scene with a leaf added to it by

3
00:00:07,568 --> 00:00:11,019
putting a leaf texture on a square. Here's the same scene with the square

4
00:00:11,019 --> 00:00:14,954
selected, so you can see the underlying geometry. The two key things I needed

5
00:00:14,954 --> 00:00:18,178
to do was mark the square as transparent, and to make a texture with an alpha

6
00:00:18,178 --> 00:00:22,726
channel. Recall that a transparent object needs to be given a transparent

7
00:00:22,726 --> 00:00:26,985
material. This ensures that it'll be rendered after all opaque objects, and

8
00:00:26,985 --> 00:00:30,040
that blending is turned on so that any transparent pixels will blend properly

9
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:35,012
with the objects behind. In this case most of the pixels are either opaque or

10
00:00:35,012 --> 00:00:39,146
fully transparent, but the idea is the same. By turning on blending, the leaf's

11
00:00:39,146 --> 00:00:43,756
RGB values are properly blended using its alpha values. Actually making the

12
00:00:43,756 --> 00:00:47,234
texture with an alpha channel, I leave to you. Packages such as GIMP,

13
00:00:47,234 --> 00:00:51,516
Paint.net, or Photoshop can create an alpha channel for an image. You'll

14
00:00:51,516 --> 00:00:55,420
typically want to use the PNG format to store the results, since PNG supports

15
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:59,792
alpha. Here's an example of an object with its alpha texture. White areas are

16
00:00:59,792 --> 00:01:03,248
where the plant is, black is transparent, and gray alphas mean the pixels are

17
00:01:03,248 --> 00:01:05,930
partially covered by some leaf.
