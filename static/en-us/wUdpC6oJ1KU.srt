00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,710
Now that we've walked through the
derivation of the projection formula.

2
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:06,180
It's your turn to implement
it in your library.

3
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:09,920
Also write a function to compute
the component of a vector orthogonal

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:11,540
to a given basis vector.

5
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:14,354
After you finished,
use your code to compute the following.

6
00:00:14,354 --> 00:00:20,315
First find the projection
of the vector 3.039,

7
00:00:20,315 --> 00:00:26,553
1.879 onto the vector 0.825, 2.036.

8
00:00:26,553 --> 00:00:32,873
Second, find the component of -9.88,
-3.264,

9
00:00:32,873 --> 00:00:37,492
-8.159 orthogonal to the basis vector

10
00:00:37,492 --> 00:00:42,623
-2.155, -9.353, -9.473.

11
00:00:42,623 --> 00:00:47,303
Finally decompose the vector 3.009,

12
00:00:47,303 --> 00:00:50,592
-6.172, 3.692,

13
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:55,903
-2.51 into a sum of two
orthogonal vectors,

14
00:00:55,903 --> 00:01:01,847
one parallel to, and
one orthogonal to, 6.404,

15
00:01:01,847 --> 00:01:07,350
-9.144, 2.759, 8.718.

16
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:10,180
As usual, please make sure to
express your answers within

17
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:12,320
an accuracy of three decimal places.
