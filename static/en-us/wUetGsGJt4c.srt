00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:02,940
Now, I'm sure you've noticed many different areas of the brain are involved in

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:06,886
memory. When it comes to long term memory explicit and implicit memories are

3
00:00:06,886 --> 00:00:12,237
stored in different areas. Explicit memories are taken in from the prefrontal

4
00:00:12,237 --> 00:00:16,654
cortex and processed in the hippocampus. Then they're returned to the area

5
00:00:16,654 --> 00:00:21,160
where the sensory information was originally processed. [INAUDIBLE]. So, for

6
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:24,680
example, your explicit visual memory would be stored in the occipital lobe,

7
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:28,310
whereas, for example, your explicit memory about the way something felt would

8
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:33,731
be stored in this sensory cortex. And the auditory memories would be stored in

9
00:00:33,731 --> 00:00:37,650
the auditory cortex. Implicit memories are processed and stored in their

10
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:41,786
cortexes. As well as the straitum, amygdala, and cerebellum.
