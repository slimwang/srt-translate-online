1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,300
They're our Klout scores. So first let's calculate the mean. Push Cmd down arrow

2
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:11,632
key and then you see that there are 1,048 values. And make sure we don't have a

3
00:00:11,632 --> 00:00:20,628
header row, which we don't. So we know that n is 1,048. So anywhere really, we

4
00:00:20,628 --> 00:00:29,930
can write equals, average, A1, colon A1048. So we get that the mean is 37.72

5
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:37,257
approximately. Let's calculate the standard deviation. We calculated our mean in

6
00:00:37,257 --> 00:00:50,632
cell D1048. Cell rate in cell B1, equals A1 minus $D $1048, which keeps the

7
00:00:50,632 --> 00:01:01,776
value in cell D1048 constant. Okay, the we'll go to cell B1 hit Cmd+C to copy

8
00:01:01,776 --> 00:01:10,760
it, go to cell A1, Cmd down arrow key go to cell B1048, Cmd+Shift up arrow key.

9
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:18,976
So all of column B is highlighted, Cmd+B. Now we have all our deviations. And

10
00:01:18,976 --> 00:01:25,124
actually what we could do is instead, we can just calculate the square

11
00:01:25,124 --> 00:01:33,410
deviations. So let's put parenthesis around the deviation and then square it.

12
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:40,957
Now let's copy this and paste it. Now we have all our squared deviations in

13
00:01:40,957 --> 00:01:49,120
column B. So we calculate the variance by taking the average of this, equals

14
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:59,083
average B1:B1048. So that's our variance and then our standard deviation is the

15
00:01:59,083 --> 00:02:04,145
square root, equals square root of D1.
