1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,120
Inside my editMenuItem function,

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:05,775
I see that in my render_template,
I'm passing in three variables that my

3
00:00:05,775 --> 00:00:08,710
editmenuitem.html file is
going to have access to.

4
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:11,270
The restaurant_id, the menu_id, and

5
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:13,880
i, which is going to represent
the item we want to edit.

6
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:15,450
So to edit a new menu item,

7
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:19,160
I'm going to create a form, just like
I did when I created a new menu item.

8
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:22,150
Inside the form I'm going to
call my edit menu item function

9
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:24,060
with the appropriate parameters.

10
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:27,990
Here I'll prompt for the name of the new
menu item and create an input field.

11
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:32,310
Using the placeholder attribute of HTML
I can have that field already filled out

12
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:34,670
with the name of the item
I'm going to edit.

13
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:36,390
I'll then add a button called Edit.

14
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:39,552
And here I create another link to
cancel just in case I realize I

15
00:00:39,552 --> 00:00:41,770
actually don't want to
edit my menu item.

16
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:45,450
When I save and run, I see that I can
now change the name of my menu items.

17
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:48,040
