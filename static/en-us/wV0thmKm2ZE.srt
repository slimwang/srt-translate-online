00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,284
To transform a surface normal you need to use the transpose of the inverse of

2
00:00:03,284 --> 00:00:07,671
the matrix you used to transform the surface itself. Anisotropic filtering is a

3
00:00:07,671 --> 00:00:10,660
way of improving how a texture map looks by taking additional samples and

4
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:15,087
blending them. Skinning is an animation technique that uses bones to define the

5
00:00:15,087 --> 00:00:19,525
area of influence of the rigid parts of the model. Lambertian reflectance is

6
00:00:19,525 --> 00:00:24,205
the model used for the diffuse component of the basic illumination model. The

7
00:00:24,205 --> 00:00:27,725
axis/angle formulation in a quaternion describe the same thing, a rotation

8
00:00:27,725 --> 00:00:32,494
transform. The vertex shader uses the model-view matrix to transform points in

9
00:00:32,494 --> 00:00:33,730
view space.
