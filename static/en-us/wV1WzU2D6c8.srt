00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:06,116
We had to make changes in two classes, the car class and the stimulation class.

2
00:00:06,116 --> 00:00:10,778
In the car class, we now return an ArrayList which is allocated here, we add a

3
00:00:10,778 --> 00:00:17,605
passenger to that ArrayList, whenever one has reached his destination. And all

4
00:00:17,605 --> 00:00:23,700
the way in the end, we return that ArrayList as the return value of the method.

5
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:27,590
Did you modify the Java Doc, to add an add return statement. If so, pat

6
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:33,170
yourself in the back. In the drives car method, we call the drive method. That

7
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:37,436
returns an ArrayList. For each person in that ArrayList, we print the drop off

8
00:00:37,436 --> 00:00:43,154
message. Note, that I didn't even bother to save the return value of the drive

9
00:00:43,154 --> 00:00:47,865
method in a variable. You can of course and you may find that it makes the code

10
00:00:47,865 --> 00:00:53,535
easier to understand. But here I say c.drive returns an ArrayList. And for

11
00:00:53,535 --> 00:00:59,670
every person in that ArrayList, I do something with this loop. Now, we have

12
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:03,474
achieved the goal of our reorganization. The car class no longer knows anything

13
00:01:03,474 --> 00:01:07,996
about system.out. The Simulation class does, but that doesn't bother me so much

14
00:01:07,996 --> 00:01:11,636
because that simulation class also needed to know about system.in to read the

15
00:01:11,636 --> 00:01:17,698
user input. So the simulation class deals with input and output, the car and

16
00:01:17,698 --> 00:01:22,690
person class are blessedly unaware of that. Congratulations for having worked

17
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:26,370
through such a complex example. Real life code does look like that, with lots

18
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:33,059
of classes. And in the next unit, you will see the Java way of organizing

19
00:01:33,059 --> 00:01:36,303
related classes.
