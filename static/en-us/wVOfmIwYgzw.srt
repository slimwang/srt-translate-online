00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:02,590
So let's see if we understood the difference between

2
00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:05,224
the disks and the tape. If we want to read

3
00:00:05,224 --> 00:00:08,584
a gigabyte file from start to end it is okay

4
00:00:08,584 --> 00:00:11,368
to use disk or tape, or is it okay to

5
00:00:11,368 --> 00:00:16,321
use both as far as performance is concerned? But

6
00:00:16,321 --> 00:00:19,016
if we want to read just the first and just the

7
00:00:19,016 --> 00:00:21,942
last byte of a one gigabyte file that will work

8
00:00:21,942 --> 00:00:25,561
reasonably well with a disk, with a tape, with neither

9
00:00:25,561 --> 00:00:29,000
of them, or with both of them. And if we want to make a

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,890
cat happy, we would give it a hard drive or a reel of magnetic tape.
