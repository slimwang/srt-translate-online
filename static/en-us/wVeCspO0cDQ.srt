1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,290
Now, we're ready for the next step.

2
00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:04,790
So far, you've seen quite
a few buttons and labels.

3
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:08,560
But remember, the UI kit offers
a diverse palette of UI controls.

4
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:11,470
This gives us the freedom to
choose UI elements that make for

5
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:13,160
the most intuitive user experience.

6
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:18,210
In the next step, Color Maker,
we have three UI switch controls.

7
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:21,660
Which are fairly similar to buttons
with one new type of event.

8
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:23,220
When the user flips the switches,

9
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:26,670
we see the combination of the three
color components in the window.

10
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:29,990
Here we'll use three controls
hooked up to three outlets and

11
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:33,960
we'll route the events from all
three into a single action.

12
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,580
The code and story board
are complete but the outlets and

13
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:38,350
actions aren't connected yet.

14
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:41,090
Go ahead and download the project
from the downloadable section.
