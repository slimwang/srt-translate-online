1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
This answer is not at all trivial, and I don't blame you if you get it wrong.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The answer is actually 1, but the projection itself is nonlinear.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I can draw, really easily, a nice 1-dimensional space that follows these data points.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
If I am able to project all the data points on this 1-dimensional space,

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I capture the essence of the data.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
The trick, of course, is to find the nonlinear 1-dimensional space and describe it.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 99:59:59,999
This is what's going on in the state-of-the-art in dimensionality reduction research.
