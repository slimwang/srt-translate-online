00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:03,756
Once you've picked an object, you might want to drag it to a new position. Here

2
00:00:03,756 --> 00:00:06,944
is a demo of dragging in action. It's a bit more involved, since you also have

3
00:00:06,944 --> 00:00:10,380
to track and respond to mouse move and mouse self events. I'm not going to walk

4
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:13,378
through the codes since you can take a look yourself. The main question with

5
00:00:13,378 --> 00:00:17,025
dragging in 3D space is how to constrain the third dimension? There are usually

6
00:00:17,025 --> 00:00:19,860
two choices. One is to constrain the movement to be parallel to the screen

7
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:23,908
surface as seen in this demo. The other method is to limit movement of the

8
00:00:23,908 --> 00:00:28,258
object to be on a world plane or other geometry in the scene. For example, if

9
00:00:28,258 --> 00:00:31,064
you drag a handle on a face of a box to resize it, you limit interaction to be

10
00:00:31,064 --> 00:00:35,988
along the face's normal direction. Beyond the various mouse and keyboard

11
00:00:35,988 --> 00:00:39,173
combinations, double-click, Shift, and Ctrl keys, there are also different

12
00:00:39,173 --> 00:00:42,902
forms of selection. In areas as diverse as real time strategy games, and

13
00:00:42,902 --> 00:00:45,586
computer-aided design programs, you can select a whole set of objects by

14
00:00:45,586 --> 00:00:50,365
drawing a rectangle around them on the screen. This sort of selection is done

15
00:00:50,365 --> 00:00:53,245
by finding which objects are fully or partially inside what is essentially a

16
00:00:53,245 --> 00:00:57,893
smaller frustum on the screen. Lasso selection lets you draw an arbitrary shape

17
00:00:57,893 --> 00:01:01,987
on the screen for choosing a set of objects. Yippee ki-yay, these aren't built

18
00:01:01,987 --> 00:01:05,620
into 3GS. I just wanted to point out some ways of doing selection. Keep in mind

19
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:09,682
that you don't have to make a selectable object a visible object. For example,

20
00:01:09,682 --> 00:01:12,412
for positioning a directional light, you might put an invisible sphere in the

21
00:01:12,412 --> 00:01:16,038
scene and make it selectable. Wherever the user clicks on the sphere determines

22
00:01:16,038 --> 00:01:20,320
a point in space, which in turn, determines the direction the light comes from.

23
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,374
This is a far as we're going with selection and interaction. The rest of this

24
00:01:23,374 --> 00:01:26,110
unit will be about animation, which is a huge topic.
