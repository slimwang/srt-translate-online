1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
This should look familiar from the previous material.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
It's 77, and the reason is in A3,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
we have an 80% chance

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
for the action going east to reach 100.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
But the remaining 20%, we either stay in place or go to the field down here,

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
both of which have an initial value of 0.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
That gives us 0, but we have to subtract the cost of 3,

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
and that gives us 80 - 3 = 77.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
It's also easy to verify that any of the other actions have lower values.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
For example, the value of going west will be

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
0 in all possible outcomes given the current value function

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
minus 3, so the value of going west would right now

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
be estimated as -3, and 77 is larger than -3.

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Therefore, we'll pick 77 as the action that maximizes

15
00:00:49,000 --> 99:59:59,999
the updated equation over here.
