00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:02,360
The DOM is a data structure.

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:05,800
It can best be described as a tree, much like a family tree.

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:09,000
So, I've got a sample family tree here.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,215
This family tree has parents, it has children, and it even has siblings.

5
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:26,639
Elements that are nested inside each other in the DOM are children, like, for

6
00:00:26,639 --> 00:00:30,280
instance, this unordered list, which is a child of div.

7
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:34,660
Elements at the same level are siblings, like these two list elements or

8
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:36,270
this unordered list and this form.

9
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:40,690
And of course, we can go up the DOM as well.

10
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:43,980
For instance, this div is the parent to that div.

11
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:48,620
When writing HTML, you create a collection of nested elements that, in the end,

12
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:51,990
resembles a structure much like this family tree.

13
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:54,930
This HTML would map to the DOM tree you see over here.

14
00:00:55,998 --> 00:01:00,240
Here, the body's at the top level and it has some divs nested underneath it.

15
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,960
For this quiz, I want you to examine this DOM tree.

16
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:07,120
Which of the following DOM elements is the immediate parent of

17
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,920
the two list elements?

18
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:12,220
You can see them in the HTML here and in the DOM tree over here.

19
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:19,710
Is it the body, this div, this ul, or is it none of these?
