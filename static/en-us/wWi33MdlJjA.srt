If you chose 24 minutes, nice work. I know that there's 60 minutes in an hour,

2
00:00:04,834 --> 00:00:09,619
so I need to split that 60 minutes up into five equal pieces. I know 60 divided

3
00:00:09,631 --> 00:00:14,221
by 5 is 12, so if I go 1 5th of an hour, I've just gone 12 minutes. But I need 2

4
00:00:14,233 --> 00:00:18,867
5ths an hour, I need double that. So to go 2 5ths in an hour, I need to go 2

5
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:24,044
times 12 minutes, so I need to go 24 minutes. 2 5ths of an hour is really just

6
00:00:24,056 --> 00:00:24,688
24 minutes.
