00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Megan has a question about security in the real world.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
She saw an ebook company that encrypts the ebook using as a key

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
the person credit card number to place reliance presumably on the user

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
to decide whether it's safe to share it.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
This sounds like a really bad idea to me to be embedding personal information

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
in the ebooks.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The goal here is to watermark, to have the digital content specific to each user

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
in a way that if they distribute copies of it--they put it on a file-sharing site

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
or they abuse the copyright in someway--

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
that it can be traced back to them.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
There has been quite a bit of work on using cryptography to make watermarks,

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
especially in videos but also possibly in books and images.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
You can embed something that makes each image unique and as hard to remove without breaking the image.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
This is probably much harder to do for plaintext than it is for video

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
just because you can't really modify the text, but you could do things that--

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
and this gets a little towards stenography where you're hiding a message

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
inside something that looks like an unencrypted document.

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
You could be doing things where you are varying the spacing or you're changing

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
things that don't really affect the content.

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Or, in the embedded information in the ebook that you don't actually see when you read it,

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
you could be hiding some extra information which could embed the identity

22
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
of the person who bought the book.

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
That would be possibly easy to strip out, so that's something that you need to worry about.

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
If you want to use a watermark--in this case it seems like it's a really improper way

25
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
to treat the customers if they're not knowing this is happening and especially if it's their

26
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
credit card information that could be used in a way that's abusing the user.

27
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
There are legitimate reasons to want to do watermarking of digital content like this

28
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
and cryptography provides a great way to do it.

29
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
The challenge if you're doing it for something like video is

30
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
you can do a lot of things to modify the video that might get rid of the watermark.

31
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Simple things like using the lowest bits in each pixel to encode the watermark--

32
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
well, those are really easy to remove, because you can change all the lowest bits

33
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
in the pixels without changing what the video looks like.

34
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
So there are lots of clever schemes that try to do things that are hard to remove,

35
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:23,000
like changing the timing of black screens between scenes and doing things

36
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:30,000
that are more pervasive in the whole image but still don't make the content broken.

37
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
There are lots of social issues here about whether you can secretly track people

38
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
and whether that should be illegal or encouraged

39
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
or what kind of authorization you need to do that.

40
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Then there are interesting crypto issues of if it seems acceptable to do this in some context,

41
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
like when a Hollywood studio is distributing a movie.

42
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
They have a pretty good reason and good understanding of the people they distribute to

43
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:59,000
that they want to keep close track on it and find out if anyone is leaking copies early

44
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
to put a watermark in those things--to find a way to do that cryptographically

45
00:03:03,000 --> 99:59:59,999
that can't be easily removed and doesn't damage the content in ways that are noticeable.
