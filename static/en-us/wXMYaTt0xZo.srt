1
00:00:00,005 --> 00:00:02,560
We know that 21 equals to 3 times 7.

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:06,010
And 3 and 7 are prime numbers.

3
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:10,030
Therefore, totient 21
should be 2 times 6.

4
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:12,490
And the result is then 12.

5
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:14,420
So 12 is the answer.
