00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,245
Now let's see how to implement
an interstitial ad in Android Studio.

2
00:00:04,245 --> 00:00:06,973
And for this I'll be using
the Amazon Mobile Ads API,

3
00:00:06,973 --> 00:00:09,649
which I've downloaded from
their developer site.

4
00:00:09,649 --> 00:00:11,554
If you still need to download that API,

5
00:00:11,554 --> 00:00:14,964
please refer back to our reading
node for instructions, otherwise,

6
00:00:14,964 --> 00:00:18,222
follow along with my code and
we'll test our end result together.

7
00:00:18,222 --> 00:00:23,405
So I've opened Android Studio and titled
a new project named My Interstitial Ad.

8
00:00:23,405 --> 00:00:25,074
You can name yours whatever you want,
but

9
00:00:25,074 --> 00:00:27,992
keep in mind that it's always good to
have a clear and descriptive name.

10
00:00:27,992 --> 00:00:30,860
Then let's create a new
blank activity and

11
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:33,655
I'll name it Interstitial Ad Activity.

12
00:00:33,655 --> 00:00:37,487
Okay, great, and we can see we have
a few bare bones things in here already.

13
00:00:37,487 --> 00:00:43,033
We have our xml layout file here,
and our interstitial ad activity.

14
00:00:43,033 --> 00:00:46,557
The most important method to us here
is going to be our on create method,

15
00:00:46,557 --> 00:00:49,811
which sets our view up so
that we can display our interstitial ad.

16
00:00:49,811 --> 00:00:53,226
So I've copied this Java file,
and pasted it into our project,

17
00:00:53,226 --> 00:00:54,625
in the Java lives folder.

18
00:00:54,625 --> 00:00:57,430
Then we need to click it and
say add as library.

19
00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:01,442
Now, we should be able to open it,
and we can see all the classes and

20
00:01:01,442 --> 00:01:06,101
interfaces that we have access to,
like add layout and listener, and also,

21
00:01:06,101 --> 00:01:07,260
interstitial ad.

22
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:11,549
We also need to add a couple lines of
code to our android manifest XML file.

23
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:12,953
So let's take a look at that.

24
00:01:12,953 --> 00:01:14,739
Inside our applications tag,

25
00:01:14,739 --> 00:01:18,591
I've added lines that reference
Amazon's ad activity package.

26
00:01:18,591 --> 00:01:22,027
And outside of the application tag,
you can see that I've also declared

27
00:01:22,027 --> 00:01:25,759
the permissions we need to use, which
let us use the Internet to retrieve ads.

28
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:29,890
I've also added these extra runs that
allow us to get the user's locational

29
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:33,899
data, these can be useful if you want
to target ads to specific location.

30
00:01:33,899 --> 00:01:38,052
So make sure you've changed your android
manifest and included your library.

31
00:01:38,052 --> 00:01:41,395
And now, let's dive into our Java
code to make an interstitial ad.
