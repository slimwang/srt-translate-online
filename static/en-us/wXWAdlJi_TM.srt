Since between group variability deals with the variability between groups,

2
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:10,342
obviously, then we're concerned with the number of groups we have. There are

3
00:00:10,342 --> 00:00:14,186
three groups, and the degrees of freedom is then 2. For within group

4
00:00:14,186 --> 00:00:20,636
variability, we add the degrees of freedom from every group. 2 plus 2 plus 2,

5
00:00:20,636 --> 00:00:23,405
which is 6.
