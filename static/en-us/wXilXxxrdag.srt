00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:07,780
For f of x equals a to the x. When x increases by 1, f of x is multiplied by a.

2
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:11,510
A here is the growth rate. And that means we can tell what the growth rate of

3
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:15,584
an exponential function will be by looking at its base. Which we can see, in

4
00:00:15,584 --> 00:00:17,288
this equation, is a.
