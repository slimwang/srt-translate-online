1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,700
The answer is false, here's an example,

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:07,800
here's a fine graph that maps to this
course graph under this matching.

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:12,490
Notice that the matching is even
maximal but look at the projected cut.

4
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:14,010
This cut is sub-optimal.

5
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:16,950
It would have been better to
cut the graph down the middle,

6
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:20,970
the important point to remember
is that corsening is a heuristic.

7
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:24,090
An interesting follow up
question might be well,

8
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:28,780
what if you had coarsened based on a
maximum rather than a maximal matching?
