00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:05,905
We just mentioned Blue Button,
which began in the VA in 2010,

2
00:00:05,905 --> 00:00:08,876
and was adopted by ONC in 2012.

3
00:00:08,876 --> 00:00:14,116
Their SNI work group expanded
the standard, added more structure,

4
00:00:14,116 --> 00:00:18,760
and dealt with direct integration
to create Blue Button+.

5
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:23,920
This graphic from the Blue Button+ site,
shows how it can be used in conjunction

6
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:31,380
with direct, to move the data from the
providers, EMR, to the patients, PHR.

7
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:34,940
This one shows that Blue Button+ can
be used to bring data from multiple

8
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:41,590
providers, into one patient
manage technology, such as a PHR.

9
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:46,280
The data itself is in an XML document,
formatted according to CCDA.

10
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:51,250
You should recall that CCDA documents
are constructed from templates for

11
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:55,070
the document, its sections,
and the actually data entries.

12
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:59,490
Here's a list of some of the sections
of the Blue Button+ CCDA.

13
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:05,010
More recently,
the Blue Button+ rest API effort,

14
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:09,340
is offering a restful API approach
to using Blue Button+ for

15
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:14,380
both its traditional role, push, where
providers send the files to patients.

16
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:19,655
Or their designated PHR app,
as well as pull, where patients can in

17
00:01:19,655 --> 00:01:25,529
effect subscribe and receive updates, as
new data comes into their providers EHR.
