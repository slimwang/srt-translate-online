1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
And now for the answer.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Indeed, I gave a hint right within the story.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
"Battery" is the correct answer.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
After 3 hours, my battery had run out.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Which means that until then, I had worked on battery power.

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
In order to recharge my battery, I reconnected to AC power.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
And it turned out that it was this difference that caused the program to fail.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
When my laptop ran on AC power, which was precisely the configuration

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
with which everything was installed,

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
the program worked just fine.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
If it ran on a battery, however, the program failed.

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
It turned out that my laptop ran slower when running on batteries.

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
This saved energy, but also introduced interesting timeout errors.

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
So I made a mental note to fix this as soon as we got home,

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
and of course, I gave the demo on AC power

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
to make sure that all our tests were not in vain.
