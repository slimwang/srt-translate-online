As I've tried to indicate, ACME is relatively simple as far as ADL's go.

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:09,660
There are lots of other features that other ADL's have that ACME does not.

3
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:13,650
So I'd like you to think for a minute, what other features it might be nice for

4
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:17,030
an architectural description language to have that ACME doesn't, and

5
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:18,110
see if you can list them here.
