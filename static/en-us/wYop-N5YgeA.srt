Hello, I'm Seerajperhead.

2
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:09,870
I'm a program manager at Udacity, and
this is my bad interview experience.

3
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:11,640
So, after three years
of engineering college,

4
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:16,190
I really wanted to intern at this
one tech company in Cupertino.

5
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:18,040
I spent all year preparing for this and

6
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:19,890
I knew that this was the company
I wanted to work for.

7
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:23,790
I nailed my first interview and
then got into the second interview

8
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:26,410
which was a tech screen
with one of their teams.

9
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:28,290
And I completely failed it.

10
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:29,740
I don't even remember the questions.

11
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:31,690
I don't remember if I was dizzy or
tired or

12
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:35,120
sleepy or what, or
just unqualified I guess.

13
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,500
But that interview was terrible.

14
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:40,440
I spent about two weeks
like depressed about it,

15
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:43,028
thinking about like that it's time for
me to move on.

16
00:00:43,028 --> 00:00:45,710
And find like a different
company I'd be interested in.

17
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:47,900
Surprisingly the recruiter
called me back.

18
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:52,240
And that while I didn't make their
one position, they wanted me for

19
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:53,310
a different one.

20
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:57,510
So I agreed, and happily took another
interview which I also failed.

21
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:00,650
At that point I realized that maybe
I wasn't cut out to be an engineer

22
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:01,990
at their company.

23
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:04,220
And I decided that I would
look at other companies and

24
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:06,700
finally move on from these dreams.

25
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:10,035
But then the recruiter
messaged me again and said,

26
00:01:10,035 --> 00:01:14,250
Sia, while you're not cut out for one of
our engineering positions the summer,

27
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:17,270
would you like to have
a product interview?

28
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:19,780
And I didn't know much about products,
but I was like, sure.

29
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:20,860
This is the company.

30
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:21,840
This must be it.

31
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:22,600
Whatever.

32
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,300
Let's do this.

33
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:27,030
And that interview went amazing.

34
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:31,110
Looking back at that summer, I realize
that the product role was a much better

35
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:35,360
fit for me than any engineering role
could have been at that company.

36
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,330
So my takeaway from this is that
sometimes interviews don't go the way

37
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:40,000
you want them to,

38
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,640
and sometimes job positions don't enough
the way that you think they will.

39
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,010
Don't stress too much about a bad
interview, because in the end,

40
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:49,960
it just becomes a funny
story to tell your friends.
