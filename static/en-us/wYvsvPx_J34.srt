00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,636
Alright. Before we get started on the class project,

2
00:00:03,636 --> 00:00:07,376
this lesson's assignment will allow you to get comfortable with

3
00:00:07,376 --> 00:00:09,960
the type of work that data scientists do using

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:13,800
a small and classic data set. This data set describes

5
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:16,010
the riders on the Titanic and a bunch of

6
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:19,340
information about them. For example, what class they were in,

7
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:21,650
whether they were male or female, how old they

8
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:25,500
were, etcetera. Over the course of the assignment, you'll build

9
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,670
a few different models. The models will

10
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:31,510
start out simple, but they'll get increasingly complex.

11
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:34,210
To see if using data science, we can

12
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:36,790
predict who will survive and who won't survive

13
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:39,990
the Titanic tragedy. This may sound complicated, but

14
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:43,210
don't worry. We'll give you plenty of help.

15
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:44,360
This assignment is meant to get you in

16
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:46,430
the habit of thinking like a data scientist.
