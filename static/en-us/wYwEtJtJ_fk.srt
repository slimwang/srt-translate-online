00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:02,719
When I started these last
version three updates,

2
00:00:02,719 --> 00:00:04,810
there were two things
that I really wanted.

3
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:07,930
First was to know if somebody
had already bought something.

4
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:09,870
On me and my roommate's limited budgets,

5
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:12,250
it kind of sucks to
double buy Cheesy Flakes.

6
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:15,770
The second thing I wanted was some
way to know who was shopping.

7
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:19,133
If I'd had known that JP was in the
store, I would have been able to just

8
00:00:19,133 --> 00:00:22,970
call him immediately instead of
randomly calling all my roommates.

9
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:25,360
Now, you've effectively
solved the first issue.

10
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:26,315
By implementing buy and

11
00:00:26,315 --> 00:00:29,620
un-buy it's pretty clear whether
an item's been bought or not.

12
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:31,672
So, can we try to add this feature here?

13
00:00:31,672 --> 00:00:36,460
I am imagining a button that when
clicked put's you in shopping mode.

14
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:39,800
When you're not in shopping mode
you can't buy or un-buy things.

15
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:43,180
Shopping mode would signal that you
are in the store and actively shopping,

16
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:46,090
and when your not in shopping mode
you couldn't accidentally buy

17
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:47,220
or un-buy things.

18
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:49,660
But if you were at the store,
you could click this button,

19
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:53,180
turn on shopping mode, and
be able to buy and un-buy things.

20
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:56,460
This would also signal to everybody that
you are in the store at that moment.

21
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:59,540
I'm going to provide you with an updated
layout that includes this button here.

22
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:02,180
Something should probably change
in the Firebase Database, but

23
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:04,110
to tell you the truth,
I'm not sure what.

24
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:07,144
What do you think should change in
the Firebase Database to support

25
00:01:07,144 --> 00:01:08,943
the shopping mode that I talked about?

26
00:01:08,943 --> 00:01:09,730
And remember,

27
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:13,620
the goal is to eventually be able to
know who's shopping in the store.

28
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:16,800
Here's some options that I came up with,
which one do you think is the best?

29
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:20,470
Option A would be to change the item
POJO to have a boolean, and

30
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:23,750
this boolean would basically
represent whether the list

31
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:26,690
that the item was a part of is
currently being shopped on.

32
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:29,380
Option B would be to actually
change the shopping list,

33
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:32,980
POJO itself, to store a list
of who's currently shopping.

34
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:36,220
Option C would be to change
the shopping list POJO to

35
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:39,800
have a boolean that represents whether
the list is being shopped on or not.

36
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:43,170
And option D would be to not change
either the shopping list class or

37
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:47,440
the item class, but to instead
change the user class to store for

38
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:51,280
that current user, what shopping
lists they are currently shopping on.

39
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,220
Now, I do think that shopping mode
should be on a per list basis.

40
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:58,970
After all, one shopping list
could be for outdoor supplies and

41
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:00,810
another shopping list could be for food.

42
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:05,380
So users shop on specific lists and not
universally, just to make that clear.

43
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:06,400
All right, tell me what you think.
