1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:03,560
So overall, I think the interview
candidate marketed pretty well.

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:08,472
He asked a lot of clarifying questions.

3
00:00:08,472 --> 00:00:12,256
Asking the clarifying questions like
really trying to understand the problem.

4
00:00:12,256 --> 00:00:17,262
A lot of times as an interviewer,
you have an idea of where you want

5
00:00:17,262 --> 00:00:22,190
him to go, but getting him to
that point is his responsibility.

6
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:24,767
He has to ask those questions
to get himself there.

7
00:00:24,767 --> 00:00:29,407
I think he also did a really good job
of following my lead like when I was

8
00:00:29,407 --> 00:00:33,247
trying to get him somewhere
of actually like listening to

9
00:00:33,247 --> 00:00:37,167
the feedback that he was given and
going down those roads.

10
00:00:37,167 --> 00:00:41,004
Yes, so I think a little more white
board practice would have helped

11
00:00:41,004 --> 00:00:41,553
him out.

12
00:00:41,553 --> 00:00:44,309
You tend to want to start in
the top left of the board.

13
00:00:44,309 --> 00:00:46,417
That way,
you have plenty of room to write.

14
00:00:46,417 --> 00:00:49,300
You want to make sure that you
leave space between lines,

15
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:52,811
because you're always going to have to
go back and add lines in the middle.

16
00:00:52,811 --> 00:00:56,026
And then there were opportunities
where he would close out a tag and

17
00:00:56,026 --> 00:00:59,645
then he'd have to erase it and move
that closing down further and further,

18
00:00:59,645 --> 00:01:01,441
as we progress through the problem.

19
00:01:01,441 --> 00:01:05,545
So I would say,
give yourself more space for writing and

20
00:01:05,545 --> 00:01:08,614
don't close the tag until you're done.

21
00:01:08,614 --> 00:01:13,239
So the teach me something in five minute
question, I really like that one.

22
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:14,656
Because as an engineer,

23
00:01:14,656 --> 00:01:18,103
you're constantly having to
teach your fellow engineers.

24
00:01:18,103 --> 00:01:20,801
There's not an engineer on the face of
the Earth that it was everything about

25
00:01:20,801 --> 00:01:21,316
everything.

26
00:01:21,316 --> 00:01:24,040
So, they're constantly
helping each other and.

27
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:26,280
Teaching someone something they don't
know in five minutes is actually

28
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:30,220
a really important part of the job
that you'll do numerous times per day.

29
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:33,384
So I asked about what interested
in web development and

30
00:01:33,384 --> 00:01:36,615
what he was excited about
coming down in the future, and

31
00:01:36,615 --> 00:01:39,597
that's a question looking for
passion and drive.

32
00:01:39,597 --> 00:01:41,611
This is a career field
that's constantly changing.

33
00:01:41,611 --> 00:01:44,860
And if someone's not passionate about
the field or the product itself,

34
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:47,111
they're not going to remain
on the cutting edge.

35
00:01:47,111 --> 00:01:49,238
So it's a question
designed to determine,

36
00:01:49,238 --> 00:01:51,313
if they're going to
be someone that will.

37
00:01:51,313 --> 00:01:52,098
Stay educated and

38
00:01:52,098 --> 00:01:55,190
remain at the cutting edge the whole
time they're with your company.

39
00:01:56,210 --> 00:02:00,200
So, the question about the palindrome is
a pretty typical programming question

40
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,320
you'll receive.

41
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:05,326
The interviewer's not too interested
in whether you can actually solve

42
00:02:05,326 --> 00:02:09,197
the problem, they just want to see if
you can think like a programmer and

43
00:02:09,197 --> 00:02:13,019
if you understand the basic syntax
rules of the language being used.

44
00:02:13,019 --> 00:02:16,594
So the image carousel question is
another basic programming question

45
00:02:16,594 --> 00:02:18,901
that's just trying, it's pretty simple.

46
00:02:18,901 --> 00:02:22,102
So, we're just trying to get the
candidate warmed up at that point and

47
00:02:22,102 --> 00:02:23,629
get used to writing on the board.

48
00:02:23,629 --> 00:02:27,981
And once again, we're just trying to
see if they think like that a developer

49
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:30,506
would within the role
though be fulfilled.

50
00:02:30,506 --> 00:02:34,996
So, the question on closures is actually
the one question that I was actually

51
00:02:34,996 --> 00:02:38,594
testing the candidate's
understanding of the language on.

52
00:02:38,594 --> 00:02:43,398
It gets pretty low level and we ask some
deep questions that really let me know

53
00:02:43,398 --> 00:02:48,146
whether the candidate knows what's
going on when they're writing code.

54
00:02:48,146 --> 00:02:51,942
So the question about the technical
challenge and how did you solve it,

55
00:02:51,942 --> 00:02:55,623
that's kind of a cool-down question
coming off of the whiteboard.

56
00:02:55,623 --> 00:03:00,262
And just lets me understand some of the
things that the candidate has challenge

57
00:03:00,262 --> 00:03:03,775
themselves with and
how do they approach that problem, and

58
00:03:03,775 --> 00:03:05,751
their problem solving ability.

59
00:03:05,751 --> 00:03:11,273
And I really want to see the candidate
get through a complicated problem and

60
00:03:11,273 --> 00:03:15,913
not say, well, I had this problem and
I just gave up or I went and

61
00:03:15,913 --> 00:03:17,771
asked someone for help.

62
00:03:17,771 --> 00:03:19,048
Overall, the tone was good.

63
00:03:19,048 --> 00:03:22,008
Probably could have slowed
down a little bit and

64
00:03:22,008 --> 00:03:27,250
thought about the response to a question
a little more before answering it.

65
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:32,460
Particularly there were moments where it
felt like the candidate was going on and

66
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:35,570
on and on a little bit and they probably
could've just wrapped it up quicker.
