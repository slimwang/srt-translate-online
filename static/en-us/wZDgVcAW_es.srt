1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:02,990
There are other ways we could have noticed this important feature

2
00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:06,300
of the data set. But, there are also other ways, that

3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:10,100
by jumping into a different analysis, we might have missed this.

4
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:12,800
For example, if we just look at a five number summary

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:16,120
of the data, we might not notice this so easily. One

6
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:19,630
clue to the discreteness is that the 75th percentile is the

7
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:22,810
same as the maximum. We could also see this discreteness by

8
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:26,180
looking at how many distinct prices there are in the data set.

9
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:29,360
So here it looks like there's about 20 different prices.

10
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:32,119
Tabling the variable we get an idea of the distribution

11
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:34,650
like we saw in the histogram. So now that we

12
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:37,390
know something about the price, let's figure out on a given

13
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:40,760
purchase occasion how many eight ounce yogurts does a household

14
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:43,770
purchase. To answer this we need to combine accounts of

15
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:47,590
the different yogurt flavors into one variable. For example, for

16
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:51,340
this particular household, on one purchase occasion, they bought three different

17
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:54,700
types of yogurt. To figure this out for all the households,

18
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:57,300
we need to make use of a new function. The function

19
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:00,426
is called the transform function. Now I haven't introduced this function

20
00:01:00,426 --> 00:01:03,290
yet, but I want you to look up the function and run

21
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:05,860
the examples of the code at the bottom of the documentation

22
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:08,360
to figure out what it does. See if you can create

23
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:12,300
a new variable called all.purchases, which gives the total counts of

24
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:16,410
yogurt for each observation or household purchase. Keep in mind that you

25
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:18,710
need to save this variable to the data frame,

26
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:21,150
so this may or may not be in your syntax.
