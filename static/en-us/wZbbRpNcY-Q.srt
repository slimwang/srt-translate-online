00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:05,420
So, to calculate how many pixels we need per second, we take the horizontal

2
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:11,439
resolution, 1920, multiply it by 1200 and multiply that by 60. The answer is

3
00:00:11,439 --> 00:00:17,514
138,240,000 pixels. By the way, the word pixel is short for the phrase, pixel

4
00:00:17,514 --> 00:00:21,804
element. Note that this value is the minimum number of pixels to compute. This

5
00:00:21,804 --> 00:00:25,444
huge number helps explain why all computers may nowadays, have some sort of 3D

6
00:00:25,444 --> 00:00:29,024
graphics acceleration hardware inside them. This can take the form of a $2

7
00:00:29,024 --> 00:00:32,735
integrated chip on up to two or more graphics cards, each costing hundreds or

8
00:00:32,735 --> 00:00:34,073
even thousands of dollars.
