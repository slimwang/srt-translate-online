1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,820
Before we go any farther, deconstructing this chart we created in the previous

2
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:09,540
lesson, I wanted to take a step back to talk about what type of narrative we

3
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:14,270
might want to build around this data, and also how we might achieve it.

4
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:18,910
It is important to keep in mind as we iterate on this graphic here,

5
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:21,090
that it's okay to make mistakes.

6
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:23,820
And when I say it's mistakes are okay.

7
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:27,180
I mean that the process of creating an affective and

8
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:31,600
engaging visualization, is often a winding road.

9
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,530
We may not perfectly deconstruct and

10
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:38,270
build upon this chart to achieve the affect we want.

11
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:41,180
We might have to backtrack, try a new approach, and

12
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:42,940
go down a different direction.

13
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:46,700
Again, this is all part of the process of prototyping and

14
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:48,820
sketching of visualization.

15
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:52,620
I've said it before and I'll say it again, is that the difference between

16
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:56,040
something like EDA and the process we're about to go through with data

17
00:00:56,040 --> 00:01:02,290
visualization, is that EDA typically helps you find a message you want to tell.

18
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:06,140
In my case, the message I want to convey to my audience is that

19
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:11,190
we're in an increasingly global and capitalist age.

20
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:12,890
What do I mean by that?

21
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:14,690
And how might I tell it?

22
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:19,920
Well, even from looking at this simple chart of total World Cup attendance over

23
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:25,060
the years, we can see that the trend of the World Cup attendance games.

24
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:28,590
An aggregate is steadily increasing over time.

25
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:33,950
Proving causation is very hard, as we've seen previously, but

26
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:37,960
what I want to propose is that early on in World Cup history,

27
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:42,530
it was one less known and less popular.

28
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:48,360
But also the past was a world much more constrained by geographic and

29
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,190
logistical issues.

30
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:55,190
As we've seen advances in transportation, such as, planes and trans-Atlantic and

31
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:59,280
Pacific flights, maybe people from all of the world are able to

32
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,440
attend a World Cup Held in a single country.

33
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:07,990
And the capitalist side of it is that as the games become more and more popular,

34
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:13,740
both FIFA the organization that organizes the World Cup, and the home country

35
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:19,660
itself could benefit economically from the influx of visitors and tourism.

36
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:24,030
But also from the games itself by creating more stadiums and

37
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:28,580
more public works projects to help support the influx of people.

38
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:32,540
But I'm sure you're thinking it's a far journey to go from this

39
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:37,620
simplistic line plot to convey this message is a succinct and

40
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:43,870
effective way, but that's what the next series Of videos and code will address.

41
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:48,770
This iterative process of data visualization, which helps us

42
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:52,750
communicate our message in the most effective and efficient manner.

43
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:56,990
We've already done our EDA, and have the message we want to tell.

44
00:02:56,990 --> 00:03:00,840
We just have to work and iterate, on visualization such that,

45
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,390
we can communicate that message to our audience.
