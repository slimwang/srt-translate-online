00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,770
This is a big question in psychology. What is intelligence? Some people might

00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:08,728
channel Justice Stewart of the United States Supreme Court. And say, well, I

3
00:00:08,728 --> 00:00:11,796
know it when I see it, as he did when he was trying to define obscenity and

4
00:00:11,796 --> 00:00:16,950
pornography. But psychologists have come up with a basic answer. Intelligence

5
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:21,465
consists of a set of cognitive skills or abilities. Including abstract thinking

6
00:00:21,465 --> 00:00:26,556
and reasoning, problem solving, the ability to understand complex ideas. The

7
00:00:26,556 --> 00:00:30,651
ability to acquire knowledge, and the ability to learn from experience and

8
00:00:30,651 --> 00:00:36,960
adapt to a changing environment. Other less agreed upon intelligent components

9
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:43,630
are memory, working memory, spatial ability and mathematical ability. So, how

10
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:46,937
can scientists disagree about the theory of intelligence? Well, let's go to

11
00:00:46,937 --> 00:00:49,209
Greg and can tell us a little more about that.
