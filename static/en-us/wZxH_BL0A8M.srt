Now let's go back to our Performance pillars, and move on to Compute. The

00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:07,270
first thing understand about optimizing computation for

3
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:10,790
mobile CPUs. Is of course, the mobile hardware

4
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:13,040
is generally going to be less powerful,

5
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,430
than desktop equivalents. Your app is going

6
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:20,230
to have to deal with slower CPUs and GPUs than you're used to on desktops.
