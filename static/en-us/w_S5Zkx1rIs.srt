1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:04,950
Comparing this to what we have up here, P the principal belongs right here.

2
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:08,854
Now, what goes here is the interest rate that we use every time interest is

3
00:00:08,854 --> 00:00:14,886
compounded. This is equal to the annual interest rate, r, divided by n, the

4
00:00:14,886 --> 00:00:20,748
number of times interest is compounded per year. We can see that that's what we

5
00:00:20,748 --> 00:00:27,056
have up here. We have a 3% annual rate. 0.03 divided by 2, which gives us this

6
00:00:27,056 --> 00:00:32,610
number. Great, we're really close. Now what belongs in the exponent? We know

7
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:36,579
that what needs to go here is the total number of times that interest has been

8
00:00:36,579 --> 00:00:43,778
compounded. It's compounded n times for every t years. So, that means that the

9
00:00:43,778 --> 00:00:49,153
total number of compoundings is just nt. There we go, we have a formula that

10
00:00:49,153 --> 00:00:53,709
should be pretty easy to use. And I hope, more than anything else, that this

11
00:00:53,709 --> 00:00:55,020
makes sense.
