1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:02,940
Udacitask1.0 was a hit, but

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:07,060
list making applications are evolving,
and so has Udacitask.

3
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:12,060
You now want Udacitask 2.0 to support
a variety of item types, text, quotes,

4
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:15,940
lengths, tasks,
calendar events, you name it.

5
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:20,302
For this project you are going to focus
on completing a prototype of Udacitask

6
00:00:20,302 --> 00:00:25,570
2.0 that will support three item types,
tasks, events, and links.

7
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:30,690
But you want to keep in mind that
Udacitask 2.0 could support 10 or

8
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:34,170
20 item types some day,
organization is key.

9
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:36,970
Keeping your code scalable and

10
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:40,900
organized gets much harder as
your projects get more complex.

11
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:43,140
So it's best to anticipate
these challenges early on.

12
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:49,280
In this project you will refactor and
expand on Udacitask with modules,

13
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,850
while using Gems and Bundler to improve
your desk task style and functionality.
