1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:03,550
Okay, JP,
I've been procrastinating long enough.

2
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:06,490
I need to do something about privacy and
chopping the sharing.

3
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:08,460
Right now,
when you click on the my list screen,

4
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:10,930
you see every single shopping list.

5
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:14,180
And while it does show you who
owns each list, it still shows you

6
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:17,580
all of the lists that were created
even from strangers that you frankly,

7
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:19,030
don't care about.

8
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:20,740
Instead of this being a free for all.

9
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:23,730
I think the best idea would be to
implement some sort of sharing.

10
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:25,190
Here, let me show you what I've got.

11
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:29,330
My plan is that when you make a list,
only you can see and access that list.

12
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:32,165
So if I have my generic grocery
list here and I just made it.

13
00:00:32,165 --> 00:00:33,675
Only I can actually see this.

14
00:00:33,675 --> 00:00:36,285
But what I'll do is,
I'll add a little share button up here.

15
00:00:36,285 --> 00:00:38,325
Clicking share opens up
a list of your friends.

16
00:00:38,325 --> 00:00:40,905
Out of the hundreds or
thousands of users, or hopefully,

17
00:00:40,905 --> 00:00:43,860
hundreds of thousands of users,
that they'll someday be.

18
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:46,380
You probably have a smaller circle
of friends that you actually want to

19
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:47,560
share shopping lists with.

20
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,980
So we'll store the data of who
you say that you often share

21
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:51,000
shopping lists with.

22
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,910
And then you could add additional
friends by clicking this

23
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:53,560
button down here.

24
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,470
And this will take you to
the add friend activity.

25
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:58,560
And this activity here would have
a list of all users of the app.

26
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,280
So you can scroll through the users and

27
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,880
find one that you want to
be your friend, say Kagure.

28
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:03,720
Press her name.

29
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,920
And that would add her to
the list of your friends.

30
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,580
Then, with any of these friends, you
can click the little plus icon here and

31
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:11,120
that will turn the sharing on.

32
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:14,180
So if this is Walter's screens and
he just clicked this,

33
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:15,480
then he'd be sharing with me.

34
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,440
Then when I open my version of the app,

35
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:20,350
I'd be able to see the new list
that Walter just shared with me.

36
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:22,110
>> That sounds good, Layla.

37
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:24,640
So I have another idea to add here.

38
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:29,150
What if we design the data structure
like this, let me show you my screen.

39
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:33,470
Here, you've got your list of users and
in each user is a list of push IDs for

40
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:35,970
the shopping list they own and
are shared on.

41
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:38,860
We can set them to some
dummy value like, true.

42
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:42,670
>> JP, so that does sound interesting
but I'm already seeing one problem.

43
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:43,430
The issue is,

44
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:46,580
how do you use the Firebase list
adapter with this kind of data.

45
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:49,090
The Firebase list adapter
will be passed to location.

46
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:52,630
So, I could pass them this user list
location that has all these children.

47
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:54,780
And then I'll try to
display all these children.

48
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:56,978
So I could display a list of
these push IDs pretty easily.

49
00:01:56,978 --> 00:02:00,611
But ultimately, I'm going to try to be
using that populate view method to make

50
00:02:00,611 --> 00:02:02,217
a list item that looks like this.

51
00:02:02,217 --> 00:02:05,332
But I can't get this data here unless
I make some additional listeners, and

52
00:02:05,332 --> 00:02:07,280
it just sounds like a lot of overhead.

53
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,639
>> Yeah, that's rough.

54
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:13,252
You could duplicate some of the data or
possibly use some Firebase built-in

55
00:02:13,252 --> 00:02:17,226
filtering capabilities to only
grab the list you have access to.

56
00:02:17,226 --> 00:02:19,709
I'll look into those but
honestly, right now Iâ€™m beat,

57
00:02:19,709 --> 00:02:21,188
I'll check in tomorrow morning.

58
00:02:21,188 --> 00:02:22,055
You should get some rest.

59
00:02:22,055 --> 00:02:25,300
>> Nah, I've got some coffee.

60
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:27,040
So, I'll think about
it a little bit more.

61
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,430
It's just so
important to get the data right.

62
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:32,602
I don't think I should work on
anything else until the developer and

63
00:02:32,602 --> 00:02:33,278
I have a plan.

64
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:36,315
>> If only there were some way to
know how users would use the app and

65
00:02:36,315 --> 00:02:39,249
what kind of performance
constraints you need to deal with.

66
00:02:39,249 --> 00:02:40,570
>> [LAUGH] Yeah.

67
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:42,369
Well, it's not like we
could see to the future.

68
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,402
>> I certainly can't.

69
00:02:44,402 --> 00:02:47,355
[SOUND]
>> All right, good night.

70
00:02:47,355 --> 00:02:50,174
[SOUND]
