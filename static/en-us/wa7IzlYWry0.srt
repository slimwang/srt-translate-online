00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Okay. Welcome back. Let's go and implement this thing.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Since we're addressing a global variable,

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
we need to declare it.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
All we do is we take the command that's being input in here and append it to our list.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
To see whether everything has been recorded properly,

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
we print out saved commands at the end of the execution.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Let's see how this works.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Here again we do have our three commands as they're being processed.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
This is the recorded commands, namely: open, save, and quit.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
If you're running this outside of the web page--

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
that is, on a command line--

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
then you can actually uncomment this line and interact with the program itself.

00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
