1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:05,060
Ultimately, behavior is about how
a device responds to these events.

2
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:07,950
To model this, we need to
understand what those events are.

3
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:10,850
For the next step in the state
chart modeling process,

4
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:16,059
we will look at how to determine,
for each of the external controls,

5
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:19,390
what stimuli or
events they can provide to the device.

6
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:21,990
Using the use cases we
have developed earlier,

7
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:27,280
why don't you begin to make a list of
the user actions that might generate

8
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:30,400
events that we would expect
the radio to respond to.

9
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,610
And as a hint, go back and
look at the picture, and

10
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:37,790
use it to find each of the ways
that user can affect its behavior.

11
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:38,470
>> Okay.
So,

12
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:43,970
the first is that the user can
switch the mode button, and

13
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:47,280
that's going to change our
state machine based on, we have

14
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,380
to look at what mode we're coming out of
to determine what mode we're going into?

15
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:54,030
>> So what is the event?

16
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:56,270
What is it that the user does?

17
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:59,040
>> It's just clicking
that little knob over.

18
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,330
>> So, sliding the thing?

19
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:03,590
And, there's really two events here.

20
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:07,560
There's one is pushing it to the right,
and one is pushing it to the left.

21
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,160
>> Okay.

22
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:11,290
>> Okay?
And, as a programmer,

23
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:13,642
if you were eventually
doing an implementation for

24
00:01:13,642 --> 00:01:15,770
this thing, you would have
to deal with both of those.

25
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:17,480
And you want to deal with
them separately, right?

26
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,140
You have to know.

27
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:22,970
Now we could model those as two separate
events, or we could model them as one

28
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:26,950
event, maybe called slide, and have a
parameter to it that says left or right.

29
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:28,870
What else?

30
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:32,250
>> Okay, so
we can also turn our tuning dial.

31
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:33,480
>> Okay.
And here again,

32
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:39,180
we might want to have a parameter which
indicates the rotational angle or

33
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:44,830
something that indicates the information

34
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:49,940
that is being communicated from
the dial to the system, that's actually

35
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:55,410
going to change the vertical bar and
the actual tuning behavior of the radio.

36
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:55,910
>> Right.

37
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:58,400
Okay.

38
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,870
Another one is flipping our switch for
the AM or FM.

39
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:04,971
>> And, once again,
that's a left-right thing.

40
00:02:04,971 --> 00:02:07,100
Okay?
>> I guess, is it not toggle, though?

41
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:09,940
It seems like since we just have two
options, kind of like toggling between,

42
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:12,590
do we need a-
>> Well, this particular clock radio

43
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:18,230
that I modeled, that's on the picture
there, is a slide switch left and right.

44
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:19,380
>> Okay.

45
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:23,610
And then I have pressing
the snooze button, but

46
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:26,360
I felt like it might need to be split,
because you could press the snooze

47
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:30,790
button while it's beeping, like kind
of the intended use case for that.

48
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:33,660
But you could also press
the snooze button when

49
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:35,550
It's just sitting there on accident or
something,

50
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:36,810
or you just fumble-
>> Okay, so

51
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:38,040
let's think about this a second.

52
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:41,730
As far as the user is concerned,
the event is pressing the button.

53
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:43,160
>> Okay.
>> Okay.

54
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:46,610
What's in the user's head
is irrelevant here, okay?

55
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:51,050
At least as far as our initial
approximation of things.

56
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:55,650
Certainly, we want to consider the
possibility of what it means if the user

57
00:02:55,650 --> 00:03:00,838
presses the snooze button when
the alarm is not going off.

58
00:03:00,838 --> 00:03:06,590
And presumably, our resultant
state chart will describe for

59
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:08,710
us what behavior will happen.

60
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:14,950
This is one of the real reasons
we want to do this sort of thing,

61
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:20,790
is to come up with insights about,
well, I haven't thought about that yet.

62
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:23,360
And I need to take care of it.

63
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,910
We certainly don't want
the radio to go off

64
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:31,950
when it's not playing,
just because we hit the snooze button.

65
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:33,230
What else you have?

66
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:37,850
>> So, this is kind of
like three parts to this,

67
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:41,530
but when you press the wake button and

68
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:47,180
then press either the hour or minute
button, and then that's going to affect.

69
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:48,290
>> So is that one event or two?

70
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:53,165
>> I think the first event, there's
one event of pressing the wake button,

71
00:03:53,165 --> 00:03:55,560
because that's going to
affect our different systems,

72
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,400
like displays is now going to
have to display our wake time.

73
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:04,410
So that's a separate event, and
then there's a conjoined event when you

74
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:09,198
press the wake button, and then you
press either the hour or minute buttons.

75
00:04:09,198 --> 00:04:11,010
Now you're going to be
adjusting the display time,

76
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:16,060
so that's switching modes from your
display to wake, for instance.

77
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:20,709
And then you have this separate case for
actually changing the time.

78
00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:23,680
>> Okay.
So, we want to be clear about this,

79
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:28,910
because this one of the different
ways that state chart modeling

80
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:30,970
forces us to think about things.

81
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:34,920
As far as the user events are concerned,
they're separate.

82
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:38,065
Okay, so, there's an event of
pressing that wake button and

83
00:04:38,065 --> 00:04:39,600
releasing that wake button.

84
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,870
So another event here is release.

85
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:43,350
Pressing the wake button.

86
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:46,230
And then, there's a separate thing
going on, pressing the hour button.

87
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:49,840
The order in which those
happen is very important.

88
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:54,310
If you press the hour button first,
it's going to change the time of day.

89
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:54,870
>> Right.

90
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:58,255
>> Okay, if you press the wake button
first, then press the hour button,

91
00:04:58,255 --> 00:04:59,990
it's going to change when you wake up.

92
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:04,570
So its important that the state chart
that we end up with reflects that

93
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:08,980
difference, because the user intends
them to be used differently.

94
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:12,930
The event is pressing the wake button,
the event is releasing the wake button.

95
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:17,510
Another event is pressing the hour
button and pressing the minute button.

96
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:22,810
And our machine, as we eventually refine
it to deal with all these contingencies,

97
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:27,611
had better behave in an expected way
as far as all of the precepts in all

98
00:05:27,611 --> 00:05:32,220
of those possibilities,
all of those possible situations.
