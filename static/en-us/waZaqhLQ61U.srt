1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:02,900
Just stepping through this diagram,
okay?

2
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:05,880
We start off with some
underlying distribution,

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:08,550
pardon my inability to trace, okay?

4
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:10,730
But, of course, we don't actually
have a real distribution.

5
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:13,750
What we have is a set of particles,
okay?

6
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:16,100
Those particles are not
uniformly weighted, remember?

7
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:19,160
The sum of all the weights is one, some
particles have more weight than others.

8
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:22,320
That is, they,
that particle has a higher probability.

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,160
All right?

10
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,070
So here's what we do.

11
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:30,140
The first thing we do is we draw
a set of samples from this set, okay?

12
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:33,670
Now, you'll notice here, in this nice
picture, one of my big particles happen

13
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:39,210
to gets, to get sampled three times,
the medium particles got sampled twice.

14
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:41,450
And the this one got sampled once.

15
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:42,160
And by the way,

16
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:46,420
notice, how many times that these
itty-bitty particles get sampled?

17
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:47,930
Not at all.

18
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:52,050
That's okay, because you're doing a
random sample because it corresponds to

19
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:56,310
the density, and that random sampling
sometimes gets all the particles,

20
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:59,090
sometimes only gets the ones
with significant weights.

21
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:00,000
So, we do the sampling.

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,120
Now, the next thing you'll see is that
each one of these particles has been

23
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:10,400
shifted, but you'll notice that
the shifts are not always the same.

24
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,440
So, why do you think that is?

25
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:14,450
Do you know why that is?

26
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:23,560
>> There's a deterministic part,
nothing says that my deterministic

27
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:29,100
part has to be the same for all my
guesses of the previous state, okay?

28
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,890
Let's suppose what I do is I take a step

29
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:34,752
proportional to the number of lines
that are on the floor, right?

30
00:01:34,752 --> 00:01:37,170
So I'm going to step three lines.

31
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:40,220
But if the lines are closer
here than they were over here.

32
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:41,440
Relax, Megan.

33
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:45,360
Then going three step, three lines over
here would actually mean I'd moved

34
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,760
a smaller amount than
if I was over here.

35
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:50,020
If I had gone three lines,
I would have gone a further amount.

36
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:52,570
All this means is that
the deterministic part

37
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:54,740
doesn't have to be the same everywhere.

38
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,440
It's just deterministic.

39
00:01:56,440 --> 00:02:00,870
Then, we add in essentially what could
be thought of as the diffusion part or

40
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:02,270
the uncertainty part.

41
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:04,330
Remember when we were
generating the new sample,

42
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:07,880
we did the deterministic part,
plus the probabilistic part.

43
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,050
And that's what's here, right?

44
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:13,180
So, after we take a sample and
we move it, we add some noise.

45
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:15,750
And we do that every time
we have drawn a sample.

46
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:18,450
So since we did three
samples from this particle,

47
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:20,500
it ended up at three different places.

48
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,769
Likewise for all the others.

49
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:25,510
Then what we do is we
take our measurement, and

50
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:28,480
we've got p of z given x.

51
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,710
That's what this value is.

52
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:33,510
And we just multiply these weights,

53
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:38,160
which are all 1 to start with,
by that value, okay?

54
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:38,670
Oh, here it is.

55
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:40,350
p of z given X.

56
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:44,070
We just multiply it, and we end up
with this new set of particles, okay?

57
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:48,660
So if I erase my, my figures there you
take a look, that's a beautiful figure.

58
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,370
It's all of particle filtering.

59
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:54,040
Just sleep with it under your pillow and
you'll be in, in great shape.
