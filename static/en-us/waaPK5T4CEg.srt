00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:03,160
If you look at the diagram of the object relationships.

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:06,090
You'll notice that it hasn't changed, since the prototypal version of our code.

3
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:09,950
And that's because the pseudo-classical version is really just a thin layer of

4
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:13,560
syntactic convenience over top of the prototypal pattern.

5
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:17,110
In fact, the primary difference between these two patterns is the number of

6
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:20,880
performance optimizations that the JavaScript engines have implemented,

7
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,001
that only apply when you're using the pseudo-classical pattern.
