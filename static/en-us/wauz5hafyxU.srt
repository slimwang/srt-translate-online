1
00:00:00,702 --> 00:00:04,510
I'm going to be tackling this coding
task by following these four steps.

2
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:07,410
So first, we'll need to update
the word class to store the audio

3
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:09,050
information for each word.

4
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:12,990
After that, we will need to update the
way that the list of words are created.

5
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:15,850
Following, we'll need to
update the OnItemClickListener

6
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:19,280
to play the correct sound file
when an item is clicked on.

7
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:22,800
And then lastly, for now I'm going
to focus on the numbers activity but

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,520
then we're going to repeat the process
for all our other categories.

9
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:30,740
Now here in our world class, I want to
start by adding an integer variable

10
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:32,990
that we can use to store
an Audio Resource ID.

11
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:36,370
Now, this will just be
the resource ID that we reference,

12
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:38,550
where the actual audio
file can be found.

13
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:42,375
And notice here,
that I've called it mAudioResourceId.

14
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:45,797
Then, I want to modify the word
constructors to accept another input,

15
00:00:45,797 --> 00:00:48,068
in order to set the audio field.

16
00:00:48,068 --> 00:00:50,880
So I'm going to add it to both
constructors because all words will have

17
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53,690
to have an audio file, regardless of
whether they have an image or not.

18
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:58,070
Then, I'm going to set the member
variable mAudioResourceId

19
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:00,510
to be equal to the audio
parameter that was passed in.

20
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:03,780
Now every time you
modify the constructor,

21
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:06,190
remember to update the java.comment.

22
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:09,150
That way, any other developers
who are calling the constructor

23
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:11,090
knows what inputs to pass in.

24
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:13,630
Since we declared the audio
variable to be private

25
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:15,960
we should create a public getter method.

26
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:19,070
Just like we created public methods for
other classes in order to access

27
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:22,180
the English and Miwok strings,
as well as the Image Resource ID.

28
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:27,030
So, I want to make a public method here,
the returns an Integer Resource ID and

29
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:30,212
I'm going to name the method
getAudioResourceId.

30
00:01:30,212 --> 00:01:33,490
There are going to be no
input requirements and

31
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:36,890
the method will just return
the private audio variable.

32
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:39,730
Also, since it's a public method,
I'm going to add a comment to

33
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:42,512
the method just to clarify
what the purpose of it is.

34
00:01:42,512 --> 00:01:45,530
All right, so those were all the changes
we need to make the word class.

35
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:48,910
So, now we have a new private
audio variable and it's set

36
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:53,412
via the two constructors, and we have
a public method to access that variable.

37
00:01:53,412 --> 00:01:55,460
All right,so that finished
off our first step, and

38
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:57,650
since we modified the word
class constructors,

39
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:00,510
we'll need to modify the places
that we use those constructors.

40
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:03,740
So, for example in the NumbersActivity,
the FamilyActivity, and

41
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:05,130
all the other activities.

42
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:08,250
So there we need to change how
the word objects are created.

43
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:12,180
Now in the numbers activity,
we created an array list of words and

44
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:14,710
each word was created
with three arguments.

45
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:19,830
So first, the English word,
the Miwok word, and then the image.

46
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:22,530
Now we need to add a fourth argument
which will be the resource ID

47
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:25,020
of the audio file that
goes along with the word.

48
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:29,949
So for the number 1,
I'm going to add R.raw.number_1.

49
00:02:29,949 --> 00:02:33,973
And as you can see here, Android Studio
is smart enough to automatically suggest

50
00:02:33,973 --> 00:02:36,813
the files that have been added
to the Raw folder already,

51
00:02:36,813 --> 00:02:39,440
just in case I forget what
the resources were named.

52
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:44,059
Now for the number 2,
I'm going to add R.raw.number_2.

53
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,560
So I'm going to copy and
paste and make modifications for

54
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,780
the rest of the ten numbers.

55
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:52,610
And this is what the code should
look like when all the words have

56
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:53,520
an Audio Resource ID.

57
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:58,370
So the rest of the code in the numbers
activity can continue using the words

58
00:02:58,370 --> 00:02:59,350
array list as before.

59
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:02,780
Now, I want to make the updates
to the other categories so

60
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:04,880
that they use the right constructor.

61
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:08,850
I when I open up a PhrasesActivity,
I see that there are errors showing up.

62
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:12,235
And this is because that there
are no valid word constructors for

63
00:03:12,235 --> 00:03:13,619
just two inputs anymore.

64
00:03:13,619 --> 00:03:16,490
So let's make some changes
to get rid these errors.

65
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:19,140
So here's what the words list
should look like when each word

66
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:21,450
is using the correct
three input constructor.

67
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:25,550
Now remember, if the line of
code exceeds a 100 columns,

68
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:29,995
we should wrap the text to the next
line and then indent by 8 spaces.

69
00:03:29,995 --> 00:03:32,810
Also, note here that
the ArrayList is now final.

70
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:36,000
So I want to make similar changes to our
FamilyActivity and our ColorsActivity.

71
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:41,383
And here's what the finished code
looks like for the FamilyActivity and

72
00:03:41,383 --> 00:03:42,732
the ColorsActivity.

73
00:03:42,732 --> 00:03:45,098
All right, so
now the word class has been updated,

74
00:03:45,098 --> 00:03:47,980
as well as the places that we
call the word class constructor.

75
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:50,338
Next, we're going to update
the OnItemClickListener so

76
00:03:50,338 --> 00:03:52,758
that it plays the correct audio file.

77
00:03:52,758 --> 00:03:55,380
In the NumberActivity,
I'm going to modify the code for

78
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:57,260
when a list item gets clicked on.

79
00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:01,580
So right now, we always play
the same number_one MP3 file.

80
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:03,050
Let's insert some code above it.

81
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:05,950
But first we need to figure out
which word is getting clicked on and

82
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:08,130
then store that in a variable.

83
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:11,190
So from the onItemClick
method position parameter,

84
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:14,720
I can check the words array list to
get the word that was clicked on.

85
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,950
So, to do that,
I can just call words.get and

86
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:21,060
pass in the position variable.

87
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:24,378
So, this method will return a single
word variable, I can go ahead and

88
00:04:24,378 --> 00:04:26,750
store that variable on
the left-hand side here.

89
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:31,470
Now, if you get a red squiggle
under here indicating an error, and

90
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:35,570
the error says something like variable
words is accessed from within and

91
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:38,150
enter class needs to be declared final.

92
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:41,930
Remember, that means that we need to
declare the words ArrayList as final, so

93
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:44,650
double check that you have
the set as final up here.

94
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:47,060
So, once I know what word is clicked on,

95
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:51,660
I can get the Audio Resource ID of it
and then pass that into the MediaPlayer.

96
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:56,550
So, that means I can delete this
R.raw.number_one that we've

97
00:04:56,550 --> 00:05:01,190
hard coded in here, and
just use word.getAudioResourceId.

98
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,930
There we go, and that should work.

99
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:07,438
So, once the MediaPlayer is created,
we can start playing the audio file.

100
00:05:07,438 --> 00:05:10,570
Now I'm going to add in some
comments as well here, so

101
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:11,640
we remember what's going on.

102
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:14,730
So that finished off our third step.

103
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:17,110
Now the last step is to
make sure that it works for

104
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:19,540
the rest of the category activities.

105
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:23,880
Now, to make the FamilyActivity work,
I copied over the MediaPlayer variable

106
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,485
as well as the code for
the setOnItemClickListener.

107
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:29,260
Remember that when you copy and paste,

108
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:35,000
make sure to grab the final curly brace,
closing parentheses, and semi-colon too.

109
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,370
Also, I made the words
ArrayList final so

110
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:40,780
that I can reference it within
the item ClickListener.

111
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:43,748
Now the media player needs to
reference the activity context,

112
00:05:43,748 --> 00:05:46,830
so I changed it from the NumbersActivity
to the FamilyActivity,

113
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:50,320
because that's the activity
that we're currently in.

114
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:54,420
And then I repeated the same process for
the Colors class, and one more time for

115
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:56,240
the PhrasesActivity.

116
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,550
Now hopefully, after setting this up
several times, you're getting the hang

117
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:02,630
of setting up ItemClickListeners
as well as using the MediaPlayer.

118
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:07,986
Now let's demo the app, and we should
be able to hear Andrea's voice for

119
00:06:07,986 --> 00:06:08,744
all the words.

120
00:06:08,744 --> 00:06:10,147
So, let's start with Phrases this time.

121
00:06:10,147 --> 00:06:13,979
>> [FOREIGN]
>> Nice.

122
00:06:13,979 --> 00:06:14,699
And then go to Colors.

123
00:06:14,699 --> 00:06:19,018
>> [FOREIGN]
>> Sounds good so far.

124
00:06:19,018 --> 00:06:20,585
Now to Family Members.

125
00:06:20,585 --> 00:06:23,311
>> [FOREIGN]
>> And lastly,

126
00:06:23,311 --> 00:06:24,277
our good old Numbers Activity.

127
00:06:24,277 --> 00:06:28,700
>> [FOREIGN]
>> Perfect.

128
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:29,800
So I want to take a moment and

129
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,790
congratulate you on all
the hard work that you've done.

130
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:36,400
So you've reached a really big milestone
by incorporating all these features

131
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,010
into this app, as well as learn so
many new skills along the way.

132
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:42,420
So take a moment and
give yourselves a pat on the back.

133
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:45,040
And then go show off your app
to your friends and family.

134
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,830
We're really proud of you and
you deserve it.
