00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:01,770
Now, I want you to add
some functionality

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:03,469
inside of your G Connect method.

3
00:00:03,469 --> 00:00:05,300
When a user logs in
with her Gmail account,

4
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:08,470
we are going to see if her email
address is already in the database.

5
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:11,160
If not, then we make a new
user account for her locally.

6
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,680
After either making a new account, or

7
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:16,800
retrieving an existing one, we store
her user ID in the login session.

8
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,360
Use any combination of the three new
functions presented in the last video

9
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:21,680
to help you compete this task.
