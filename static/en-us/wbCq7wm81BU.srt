00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:01,690
Suppose this over here is your data.

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:07,160
Which of the two lines do you think maximize the margin and

3
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:10,880
would be the correct result of a support vector machine?

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,260
Warning, this question is tricky.

5
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:16,480
It's either this line over here or this line over here.
