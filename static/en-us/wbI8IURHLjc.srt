00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:05,705
Our equation would be 30 divided by x plus 4 equals 15 divided by x. Great

2
00:00:05,705 --> 00:00:10,682
thinking if you found this. Again the key works here are in the same time. We

3
00:00:10,682 --> 00:00:17,006
know Olivia can bike 30 miles in the same time that Terrance can go 15. So,

4
00:00:17,006 --> 00:00:20,974
since we have expressions for time, for those two distances, we can set these

5
00:00:20,974 --> 00:00:23,600
times equal to one another.
