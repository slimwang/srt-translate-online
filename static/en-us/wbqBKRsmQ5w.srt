1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:07,015
Now let's look that the answers. The first
set, -4, 1, and 5 is indeed a subset of

2
00:00:07,027 --> 00:00:12,358
the original set because all of the
numbers contained in the subset are in the

3
00:00:12,358 --> 00:00:21,263
original set. Let's look at the second
subset, -3, -2, 0, and 5. Since -2 is not

4
00:00:21,263 --> 00:00:28,190
in the original set, this cannot be a
subset of the original set. Looking at the

5
00:00:28,202 --> 00:00:35,910
subset zero. Zero is, indeed, in the
original set. So that the set zero would

6
00:00:35,922 --> 00:00:43,820
be a subset of the original set. Let's
look at the set. 0.5, 0.6, 1, and 2. There

7
00:00:43,832 --> 00:00:50,356
are a couple of numbers there that are not
in the original set so that, that set

8
00:00:50,368 --> 00:00:56,942
would not be a subset of the original. Now
let's look at the set 4,5. Again the

9
00:00:56,954 --> 00:01:04,197
number four is not in the original set so
this is not a subset of the original. And

10
00:01:04,209 --> 00:01:10,697
the last set, 5 and 8. Both of these
numbers are in the original set, so this

11
00:01:10,697 --> 00:01:14,926
is indeed a subset of the original set.
