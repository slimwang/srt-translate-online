00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,610
The Android platform is incredibly powerful. It unlocks

2
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:06,760
so many capabilities for you to exploit in

3
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:10,090
using your applications to deliver amazing delight to

4
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:14,180
your users. Now, with that incredible power comes

5
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:16,200
great responsibility, and there's two things that you

6
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,580
can't violate. These are two really, really important

7
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:21,600
and prime directive light constraints. The first one

8
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,630
is, you must be purposeful. What does that mean?

9
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:28,780
Just because an API exists in Google Play services

10
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:30,490
or because there's a thing that you can do, there's

11
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:33,190
a sensor that exists, doesn't mean that you should use

12
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:37,180
it just for that reason. Be purposeful means that, understand

13
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:39,510
how you're going to delivery delight or some use to

14
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:42,920
your user. Why does that feature or sensor need to

15
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:45,660
be in your application? And if it doesn't, don't put

16
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:50,810
it in there. Actually, be restrained in how you're creative.

17
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:52,680
And the second one is,

18
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,930
>> To be respectful. You need to be respectful of your user because

19
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:59,220
your application might know a lot about your user and it's really important

20
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:03,230
that you use that information to deliver delight to your user. A Contextware

21
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:07,600
application can go from being amazing to being kind of creepy pretty fast.
