Congratulations, we're at the end of lesson four.

2
00:00:03,165 --> 00:00:08,098
[SOUND] Wow. That was a lot of stuff

3
00:00:08,098 --> 00:00:10,840
we covered. Well, lesson four is also the

4
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:14,000
most content-heavy lesson in this course, so we're

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,662
really happy to see you here. We covered

6
00:00:16,662 --> 00:00:19,734
data relationships, specifically the ancestor and that has

7
00:00:19,734 --> 00:00:23,290
a relationship. We also looked at queries, query

8
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:26,390
by kind and then filtered by ancestor and

9
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:30,350
then filtered by different properties. Datastore indexes,

10
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:32,930
we took an in depth tour of datastore

11
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:38,130
indexes, it allows you to do queries in datastore and we've wrapped it up with

12
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:42,570
different consistency modelsa and transactions in datastore.

13
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:44,570
In the next lesson, we will look at

14
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:49,790
heavy duty stuff. You want to know what heavy duty is? Well, be here to join us.
