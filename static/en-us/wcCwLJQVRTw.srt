1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:01,540
Now In the studio,

2
00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:06,580
I modified the activity mainly layout to
replace the numbers category text view

3
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:10,110
with the code snippet that was provided
in the previous instructor's notes.

4
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:14,490
So I added a different background
as well as a black textColor.

5
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:17,590
Now I'm going to install the app on
my device and see how that looks.

6
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:19,820
So here's the new version running.

7
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:23,540
Hm, so there's no longer a colored
background on the numbers text view.

8
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:26,660
Well, that's expected because I
did change the background color.

9
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:29,160
So it looks like the background
is now the same color

10
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,130
as that of the whole activity.

11
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:32,890
So to answer a quiz question,

12
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:35,190
of what do we observe when we
tap on the numbers activity?

13
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:36,740
Let's see what that looks like.

14
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:38,580
So I'll click on the numbers activity.

15
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:39,830
And when I release,

16
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:43,520
I see that cool gray circle animation
starting when I put my finger down.

17
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,440
And as soon as I release,
the button click gets triggered and

18
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,180
the numbers activity opens.

19
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:51,050
So we go back and do it one more time
because it happened really quickly.

20
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:55,848
See if you can catch it.
[BLANK_AUDIO]

21
00:00:55,848 --> 00:00:59,423
Now note that if you have an older
Android device, you may just see a grey

22
00:00:59,423 --> 00:01:02,461
or blue rectangle up here when
you press down on the view, but

23
00:01:02,461 --> 00:01:04,129
going back to the main activity,

24
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:08,490
I won't get any of that animation when
I press on any of the other activities.

25
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:09,760
So let me show you.

26
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:15,400
So the family members activity,
no ripple, colors activity typing on it

27
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:19,490
no ripple and
phrases activity also no ripple.

28
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:25,690
But with the numbers activity one more
time, we saw the circular ripple.

29
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:29,700
So when you modify the background
of the numbers text view to be

30
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:31,520
the selectable item background,

31
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,820
then you'll see a visual change on the
screen when you press down on a view.

32
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:36,040
And on Lollipop devices and

33
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:39,320
newer, they'll show up as
a circular ripple animation.

34
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:42,350
So next, we'll talk about why
having a touch feedback on your app

35
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:43,330
is an important feature.
