1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:02,705
Now you have the development
environment ready, and

2
00:00:02,705 --> 00:00:04,470
can get the application source.

3
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:07,220
That's the next part of
the instructions in the Read Me.

4
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:10,490
We've provided a sample application
that also serves as a presentation on

5
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:11,850
the topic of Devops.

6
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:14,370
So, since this is meant to be
a development environment,

7
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:17,510
it would make sense to have a fork
of the application you can push to.

8
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:20,172
So, if you have a GitHub account,
you can fork the repo in GitHub and

9
00:00:20,172 --> 00:00:22,254
then clone it down onto
the vagrant home directory.

10
00:00:22,254 --> 00:00:25,243
If you'd rather just get it running,
you can clone the master repo, but

11
00:00:25,243 --> 00:00:26,573
you won't be able to push to it.

12
00:00:26,573 --> 00:00:29,840
Which really isn't much
a development environment.

13
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:33,840
Then cd into the app directory and do
the last couple of steps in the readme.

14
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:39,131
run sudo npm install,
then run the tests using grunt -v.

15
00:00:39,131 --> 00:00:40,555
Then after the test pass,

16
00:00:40,555 --> 00:00:44,193
just open up your regular browser and
go to localhost:8080.

17
00:00:44,193 --> 00:00:47,790
And when you do, what's the first
word you see on the app's home page?

18
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:48,400
Fill it in here.
