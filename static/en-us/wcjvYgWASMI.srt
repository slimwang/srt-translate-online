00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:03,150
In the last lesson, we looked at the behavior of functions, including their

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:06,762
maxima and their minima, and where they're increasing or decreasing. In this

3
00:00:06,762 --> 00:00:11,292
lesson, we're going to focus on polynomial functions in particular. We're going

00:00:11,292 --> 00:00:15,683
to look at their graphs as a whole, and then, also zoom in on certain regions.
