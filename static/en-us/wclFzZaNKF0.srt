00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,396
Now back when the Nintendo 64 was still in prototype, the execs over at

2
00:00:03,396 --> 00:00:07,463
Nintendo did a little bit of tricky marketing. They brought in a bunch of

3
00:00:07,463 --> 00:00:10,258
reporters, put them in a room, they pretty much had a screen rendering a little

4
00:00:10,258 --> 00:00:14,444
character on it, and a little interesting black box in front of them. Now the

5
00:00:14,444 --> 00:00:17,575
black box was completely hidden. All the reporters could do was stick their

6
00:00:17,575 --> 00:00:20,573
hands inside and fumble around with the controller that was in it. After a

7
00:00:20,573 --> 00:00:23,647
while of playing with these things, one of the reporters said that the

8
00:00:23,647 --> 00:00:27,251
controllers were so revolutionary, it was like his thoughts were being extended

9
00:00:27,251 --> 00:00:32,272
right into the game, which is a great case and point. If you get the controls

10
00:00:32,272 --> 00:00:35,714
right, the world plays along with you. Get it wrong and, well I'm pretty sure

11
00:00:35,714 --> 00:00:37,480
you can guess what happens then.
