1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,910
So we know that this blue curve gives us a pretty good estimate of the world

2
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:09,690
population. But, how good is it really? Well, current estimates right now say

3
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:16,329
that the world population in 2013 is just under 7.1 billion people. So is the

4
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:21,215
actually population growth of the world slower or faster than this graph

5
00:00:21,215 --> 00:00:26,030
predicts? In other words, are there more people or fewer people than predicted

6
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:31,330
here. Slower growth means that there are actually fewer people. And faster

7
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:34,510
growth means that there are actually more people than the blue graph shows.
