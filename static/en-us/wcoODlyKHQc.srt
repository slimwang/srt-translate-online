1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
There's just a single change in here--

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
instead of using x at the old step, we're using x at the new step.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
We see that they're taking almost eight orbits around that planet

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
and the trajectory does not seem to explode or to implode.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Even better, we see that the energy follows a periodic pattern.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:30,000
There is no drift up or drift down in energy, and the overall changes of the energy are pretty small,

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
but keep in mind that the energy is not precisely conserve.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
With some mathematical sophistication, one can show that there's a series of quantities

9
00:00:38,000 --> 99:59:59,999
that are close to energy and are conserved better and better.
