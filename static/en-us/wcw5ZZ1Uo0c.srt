00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:05,670
Let us return to our problem from the intelligence test to see how generate and

2
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:09,940
test might apply as a problem solving method. Again, here is a problem that

3
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:14,580
we encountered earlier. Notice that this is a more complicated problem

4
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:19,700
than the guards and prisoners problem. Here is why. In case of the guards and

5
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:24,570
prisoner problem, each transformation from one state to another,

6
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:28,842
was a discrete transformation. One could take a certain number of guards to

7
00:00:28,842 --> 00:00:32,380
the other side. One could take a certain number of prisoners to the other side,

8
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:36,020
or one could take a certain of number of guards and prisoners to the other side.

9
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:38,950
In this case, if I look at the approximation between A and B,

10
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:44,730
and I notice that the diamond inside the circle is now outside the circle and

11
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:50,350
is larger. Now suppose I were to try the same transformation from C

12
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:55,090
to D. So I can look at the circle inside the triangle,

13
00:00:55,090 --> 00:01:00,300
put it outside, and also make it larger. I notice that when I put it outside,

14
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:03,420
I can put it outside right next to the triangle, a little bit farther,

15
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:07,680
a little bit farther, a little bit farther away. I can make it the same size, or

16
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,869
a little larger, or a lot larger. Increase its size by 50% or 51% or 52%.

17
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:19,380
So this space of possibilities here is very large. So for problems of this kind,

18
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:23,650
the need for a smarter generator and a smarter tester is critical,

19
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:28,530
because this space of possibilities can become very large, very quickly.
