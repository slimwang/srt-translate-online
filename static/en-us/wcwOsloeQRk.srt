1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
This question is about key distribution.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Suppose Alice and Bob execute the Diffie-Helman protocol

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
but pick a value for g that is not a primitive root of q.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Which of the following could happen?

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Alice and Bob could produce different keys.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
The generated key would be more vulnerable to an eavesdropper.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
The number of possible keys that could be generated would be smaller than q.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Or an in-the-middle attacker would be more powerful than if g is a primitive root.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Check all that apply.
