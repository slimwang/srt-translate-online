1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:01,849
Here's the answer.

2
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:02,780
At level zero,

3
00:00:02,779 --> 00:00:08,279
we have 1 node on the tree and iterative
deepening has only visited 1 node.

4
00:00:08,279 --> 00:00:11,139
At level one,
we now have 4 nodes in the tree.

5
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:12,818
Iterative deepening level is at 5,

6
00:00:12,817 --> 00:00:17,199
the 4 nodes in the tree now and
1 node from the previous level.

7
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:21,780
At level two we now have 13 nodes in the
tree and iterative deepening level is

8
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:26,609
at 18, 13 from this tree plus
5 from the previous time.

9
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:30,399
At level three we have
40 nodes in the tree,

10
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:33,729
plus 18 makes 58 nodes visited
by iterative deepening.

11
00:00:33,729 --> 00:00:37,449
Finally, level four we have
121 nodes in the tree.

12
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:40,330
Iterative deepening
will be visiting 179,

13
00:00:40,329 --> 00:00:44,460
which is actually less than 1.5 times
the number of nodes in the tree.

14
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:45,399
Remember that before,

15
00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:51,189
when the branch factor of 2 we had
2 to the d + 1- 1 nodes in tree.

16
00:00:51,189 --> 00:00:54,128
Now, with a brand new factor of 3,

17
00:00:54,128 --> 00:00:58,446
we have 3 to the d + 1- 1
over 2 nodes in the tree.

18
00:00:58,447 --> 00:01:01,010
Let's go ahead and generalize this.

19
00:01:01,009 --> 00:01:05,640
For a branching factor of K,
the formula is K to the d plus 1 minus

20
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:09,549
1 over K minus one for
the number of nodes in the tree.
