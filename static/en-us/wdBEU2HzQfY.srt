1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:04,270
Learning management systems are tools or
collections of tools that are meant to

2
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:08,600
help teachers and educators with
the administration of their classrooms.

3
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:11,409
They take a lot of things that
traditionally we may have done in

4
00:00:11,409 --> 00:00:13,353
person or done by hand and
put them online or

5
00:00:13,353 --> 00:00:15,783
put them on a computer in
order to make things easier or

6
00:00:15,783 --> 00:00:19,308
to help with distrivuted classrooms
like the one's here in the LMS program.

7
00:00:19,308 --> 00:00:22,196
They might have things like
a grade book or a facility for

8
00:00:22,196 --> 00:00:26,020
collecting assignments or
a workflow for grading assignments.

9
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:28,870
By now, you're very familiar with one
particular learning management system,

10
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:29,721
which is T-Square.

11
00:00:29,721 --> 00:00:32,650
You've seen T-Square's assignment
system, its announcement system,

12
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:35,870
its resources system,
its testing quizzes system, maybe.

13
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:38,970
Those are all different tools that are
collected together under one management

14
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:42,610
system in order to try and deliver
a cohesive classroom environment.

15
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:45,300
Even though we use a lot of tools here,
the ultimate goal of learning

16
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:48,950
management systems is to put
a lot of things together.

17
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:51,820
Of course, one difficulty with
learning management systems is it's

18
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:54,890
easy to approach them from
a purely system perspective.

19
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:59,160
It's easy to look at them as software
solutions to a software problem.

20
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,670
But that actually can be
a little bit dangerous.

21
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:03,500
To design good learning
management systems,

22
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,850
we need to have some understanding
of the learning process as well.

23
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:08,320
We need to have some understanding
of the pedagogy behind

24
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,410
learning management systems.

25
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:13,450
We need to have some understanding of
the learning behaviors in which students

26
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:15,190
will engage while they're
using our systems.

27
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:16,800
So that's what we'll
talk a lot about here.

28
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:20,800
Not only what a learning management
system needs to be able to do, but

29
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,710
how to design it in such a way that it
actually helps the learning process.
