00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,590
Before we get started, I want to be clear about

2
00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:04,980
what we're not going to teach you in this course. We're

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:07,950
not going to be teaching mobile frameworks like bootstrap, or

4
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:11,990
native app wrappers like PhoneGap. These are great tools, but we

5
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:14,170
want to teach the fundamentals that you as a mobile

6
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:18,380
web developer need to know first. Many of our coding examples

7
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:21,710
are centered around a single conference application, which we put in

8
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:25,680
a GitHub repository. Not every concept fits well in that app,

9
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,730
so we'll be using other examples too. We're going to begin

10
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:31,630
with a lesson on mobile development tools, showing you how to hook

11
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:34,610
up the DevTools to your mobile browser. If you already know how

12
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:37,550
to do this, feel free to skip this section. Let's get started.
