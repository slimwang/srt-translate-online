00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,350
Let's do a quiz.

2
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:04,660
This quiz is on the rules
on IP fragmentation.

3
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:07,260
You can imagine that we
can implement these rules

4
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:11,150
in a packet filtering firewall
to check valid IP fragments.

5
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:14,370
Here, please mark all
answers that are true.

6
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:18,890
First, each fragment must not share
a common fragment identification number.

7
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:21,800
Second, each fragment must
say what its place or

8
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:25,290
offset it is in the original
fragmented packet.

9
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:28,580
Third, each fragment must tell
the length of the data carried

10
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:29,720
in the fragment.

11
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:33,110
Fourth, the fragment does not need
to know whether more fragments

12
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:34,520
follow this one.

13
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:36,490
Please mark all answers that are true.
