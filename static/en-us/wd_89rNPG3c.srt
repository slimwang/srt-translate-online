1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:02,969
Before going further,
let's discuss scopes.

2
00:00:02,969 --> 00:00:07,080
When defining your API client to sign
in, you'll be defining a scope for

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:09,120
how the sign in works.

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,620
A number of the scopes that
are available are these.

5
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:13,190
First, is Profile.

6
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:14,950
This is the basic login scope.

7
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:18,010
It gives your app access
to the authenticated user's

8
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:20,110
basic profile information.

9
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:23,870
This includes things such as the ID,
the display name, the image URL or

10
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:25,950
the profile URL for the user.

11
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:28,523
Secondly, there's PlusLogin.

12
00:00:28,523 --> 00:00:31,690
And this gives access to the social
features from Google Plus.

13
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:34,260
It includes the same
as the Profile scope.

14
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:38,010
But it gives access to a number of other
information, such as the age range,

15
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:42,210
the list of circles that the user
has given permission to access and

16
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:43,860
things such as the ability to read and

17
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:46,670
write activities on
the person's Google Plus wall.

18
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:49,020
The next is the Email scope.

19
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:52,220
An Email scope gives the access
to the user's email address for

20
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:54,940
their Google account that they
use to sign in as well as

21
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:59,430
the Google Apps domain that the user
belongs to, if this is appropriate.

22
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:01,540
Next is the Email scope.

23
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:05,489
This gives access to the user's email
address for their Google account and

24
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:09,170
the Google App Store name that
the user belongs to if appropriate.

25
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:12,620
Next is the PlusProfilesEmailsRead.

26
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:14,610
This is very similar to the Email scope,
and

27
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:18,610
it gives the same as the Email scope,
except it also gives your app access to

28
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:23,250
any public verified addresses that
are in the user's Plus profile.

29
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:26,140
For this example we're going
to be using the Profile scope.
