Welcome to the coffee break challenge.

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:07,260
During this challenge I'm going to
ask you a series of ten questions.

3
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:10,530
If you get the question correct be
sure to check the question feedback.

4
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:13,550
It'll give you a clue that you need for
your final prize.

5
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:15,710
Now there are no answer videos for
these questions.

6
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:17,380
So you can't really cheat, but

7
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:20,160
hints are provided in the instructor
notes if you need help.

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:20,890
All right.

9
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:23,590
Let's get our mental
loading bar on the screen.

10
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:26,360
As you complete questions,
the loading bar will get filled.

11
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:29,330
When it's full,
you've completed all the questions.

12
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:31,350
Okay.
First question.

13
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:34,920
If I want to show a picture on my phone,
what XML element should I use?

14
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,980
You can put your answer here.
