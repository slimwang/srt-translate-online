1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,630
To call this function as a method,

2
00:00:01,630 --> 00:00:04,610
we first need to add that function as a property of an object.

3
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:07,670
In this case, we'll make it a property of the red object.

4
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:09,220
Now, when I call the function,

5
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:13,230
I can do it immediately after a dot access on that object.

6
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:15,600
We already know what the positional parameters would be based on

7
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,070
the earlier example.

8
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:18,980
But what about the this identifier?

9
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:20,260
What object will it refer to?
