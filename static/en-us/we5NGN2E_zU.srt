1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,700
If you're a coach or a mentor, what you're responsible for

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:07,800
is spending 1 to 3 hours per week for every team.

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:12,080
And you're going to be working with 1 to 4 teams for up to 3 weeks.

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,610
We encourage you to meet up once a week in person

5
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:18,520
and/or once a week online per team with Skype or Google Hangout.

6
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:24,090
But what we're really looking for is you to offer your critiques and your expertise

7
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:26,910
in their LaunchPad Central narratives.

8
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:31,440
As they start talking about the customers they're actually interacting with,

9
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,420
we want you to offer comments.

10
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:36,630
Was this the right interaction? What should they have learned?

11
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:38,890
Should they have done something different?

12
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:43,600
You need to actually be giving them feedback, you need to be giving them contacts,

13
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,090
people to talk to, and sharing all your domain expertise.

14
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:50,300
This is not just kind of, "I showed up as a mentor."

15
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:53,240
This is a full-time engagement with these teams.

16
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:56,870
So think of yourself as almost their venture investor.

17
00:00:56,870 --> 00:01:01,400
Assume you just put a substantial fraction of your net worth into these teams.

18
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,880
Care like that.

19
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:06,270
Let me be clear, though. We don't want you to do their work for them.

20
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:10,120
But we want you to guide them to the right places to talk to,

21
00:01:10,120 --> 99:59:59,999
to see the right patterns in the data, and to understand what you understand.
