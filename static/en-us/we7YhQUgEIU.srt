1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:02,070
Let's go back and talk about pixels.

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:04,540
By the way everybody know
what pixels stands for?

3
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:06,910
Pixels stands for picture element.

4
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:10,060
If you talked to a television
engineer thirty years ago,

5
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:12,450
forty years ago, he talked about pels.

6
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:13,890
Computer people call them pixels.

7
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:15,320
Television people call them pels.

8
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:16,290
Little bit of information.

9
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:19,790
So we know that we have pixels
at every sort of location,

10
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:23,130
x y in image it has some we'll
just use the word color for now.

11
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:26,570
So let's zoom in on a little,
area, here and we take a look at

12
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:30,220
some particular pixel, and we can say,
that pixel's at X location,

13
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:35,670
here it says 243, Y location of 84,
and what's the value in that pixel?

14
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:39,480
Well the value actually
was three of them, right?

15
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:40,560
And here they are.

16
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:44,720
A red, a 150, a 173, and
81 written as R G and B values.

17
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:48,225
Those are the values, the intensities
of each of the three channels.

18
00:00:48,225 --> 00:00:49,845
Red, green and blue.

19
00:00:49,845 --> 00:00:50,655
All right?

20
00:00:50,655 --> 00:00:53,575
So, the color, here, are vectors.

21
00:00:53,575 --> 00:00:55,835
Remember, we talked about
them as being a vector image?

22
00:00:55,835 --> 00:00:57,145
Right?
So, at every location,

23
00:00:57,145 --> 00:00:59,575
we get a different vector.

24
00:00:59,575 --> 00:01:03,930
By the way, you see, over here, on this
white pixel, it says 254, 255, 251.

25
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:07,010
This is obviously an eight bit
image that goes from zero to 255.

26
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:11,610
If this was a floating point number
that we let go from zero to one or

27
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:15,293
floating point image, then that would
be you know 0.98, 0.999 or 1.0 and

28
00:01:15,293 --> 00:01:17,540
0.97 or something like.

29
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:18,480
All right.

30
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:25,240
So those three values together,
give you the perceived color.

31
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:28,880
When you're displaying an image,
what you're really doing

32
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,290
is you're plotting a different
locations on the screen.

33
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:37,630
A vector by essentially turning on a red
light or green light and a blue light.

34
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:40,690
You're essentially doing a plot of
those colors, but when you look at it,

35
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:43,390
it looks like a, picture, alright?

36
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:47,150
What would happen if instead
of plotting them in x y,

37
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:50,520
you plotted them in RGB space?

38
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,820
Okay?
So you're going to make them be the same

39
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:55,560
color as before, but you're going to put
them down in a, in a three dimensional

40
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:59,405
space not according to x, y, but
according to what their RGB value is.

41
00:01:59,405 --> 00:02:02,075
Well, so here I have that
same little picture, and

42
00:02:02,075 --> 00:02:04,225
I pull out the first, pixel.

43
00:02:04,225 --> 00:02:07,405
And you can see here that red is 152,
green 50, blue 40.

44
00:02:07,405 --> 00:02:12,405
So that's what down here and
this is in this three dimensional space.

45
00:02:12,405 --> 00:02:13,522
All right?
All right?

46
00:02:13,522 --> 00:02:17,652
Here's another point closer to white, so
it's all the way up, in the corner, and

47
00:02:17,652 --> 00:02:20,372
finally, here's a,
third point, all right?

48
00:02:20,372 --> 00:02:24,632
So these are plotting these
pixels in the RGB Space.

49
00:02:24,632 --> 00:02:27,952
So we go from Image Space
to Color Space.

50
00:02:27,952 --> 00:02:32,862
So, let's take those fruit pixels,
and plot them all in RGB Space.

51
00:02:32,862 --> 00:02:34,340
What would that look like?

52
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:35,800
Well, it would look like this, and

53
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:40,410
this is sort of, kind of an elegant,
three dimensional, plot of that.

54
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:43,690
And what you can notice right away
is that the pixels are sort of

55
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:44,190
grouped, right?

56
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:48,490
These kind of reddish pixels presumably
have something to do with the apples.

57
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:50,010
You know, what are these whitish pixels,

58
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:51,790
we'll they're going to
be the background.

59
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:54,350
And here are these yellowish pixels,
probably have to do with the oranges.

60
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:58,190
And you start to think about, you know,
we might be able to use your location in

61
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:02,540
color space, to try to segment out
the different parts of the image.
