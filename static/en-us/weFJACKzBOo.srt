00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,812
Now I would like you to figure out what you need to do to either side of the

2
00:00:03,825 --> 00:00:07,708
equation to make it so that what we end up with next has all the terms of x on

3
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:11,717
the left side of the equation, and no more terms with x on the right side. You

4
00:00:11,729 --> 00:00:15,790
can still have constant terms on the left side, and if you want to combine like

5
00:00:15,802 --> 00:00:19,731
terms in places where that's possible, you're totally open to that. But, you

6
00:00:19,743 --> 00:00:20,433
don't have to.
