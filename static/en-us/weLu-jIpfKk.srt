1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:02,330
Here is what I would say.

2
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:04,390
Let me explain myself.

3
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:08,189
One way to think about the question
is to ask an analytical question.

4
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:12,250
Mainly, when does the alpha
term dominate the beta term?

5
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:13,030
When that happens,

6
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:16,890
then we might not care that
the beta term depends on log p.

7
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:21,020
Algebraically, this term dominating this
term is the same as saying that it's

8
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:22,060
much, much greater.

9
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:25,710
You'll notice the log p's cancel.

10
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:28,309
That leaves us with something like this,

11
00:00:28,309 --> 00:00:32,479
which basically says n is much less
than the ratio of alpha to beta.

12
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:34,970
So let's compare that to our options.

13
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:37,790
The first option is
algebraically equivalent.

14
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:38,920
The fourth option,

15
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:43,780
even though it's qualitative,
kind of captures what this says.

16
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:48,150
So this says that we want n to
be small compared to something.

17
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:50,940
So to me, this is kind of
an acceptable intuitive answer.

18
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:53,700
What about the other options?

19
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:56,580
Option two has the relationship
algebraically wrong.

20
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:01,640
Option three is just kind of irrelevant,
there's no dependence on p here.

21
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:04,760
The last option is also
a bit of a red herring.

22
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,960
I don't know what that's
supposed to mean.

23
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,050
In fact,
even if you assume n is constant,

24
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:11,410
it doesn't satisfy this relationship.

25
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:14,010
You also remember,
it's far from reality.

26
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:16,178
Remember, I said at
some point you expect,

27
00:01:16,178 --> 00:01:18,970
in real networks, for
alpha to be much greater than beta.
