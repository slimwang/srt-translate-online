1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,750
In this exercise you'll let
GIGAGAL land on top of platforms

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:06,700
mostly by filling in this
landedOnPlatform check.

3
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:10,190
First we check to see if GIGAGAL has
fallen past the top of the platform in

4
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:13,310
the last frame, then we check
to see if either her left or

5
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:16,180
right foot is currently in
the platform's horizontal span, or

6
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:18,170
if she's straddling the platform.

7
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:24,578
And that finally means we can careful,
careful.

8
00:00:24,578 --> 00:00:25,660
Yes!

9
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:30,060
So it's time for you to give GigaGal
the ability to land on platforms.

00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:31,900
Check out the to do's in
the course code to get started.
