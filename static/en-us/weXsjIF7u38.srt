00:00:01,090 --> 00:00:03,351
Now it's your turn to
play with RTL layouts.

2
00:00:03,351 --> 00:00:06,610
You'll want to implement RTL support for
Sunshine.

3
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:07,910
When modifying the layout properties,

4
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:11,810
remember that Sunshine supports
back to SDK version 10.

5
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:15,825
It helps to have a test device or
emulator running Lollipop, because

6
00:00:15,825 --> 00:00:20,665
Android introduced a new developer
option to force RTL layout direction.

7
00:00:20,665 --> 00:00:23,325
This way you won't need to change
the language of the device

8
00:00:23,325 --> 00:00:24,935
to see what you're working with.
