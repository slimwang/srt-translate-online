00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,370
Besides looking for Waldo what is template matching good for?

2
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:06,090
Lets look at some cases.

3
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:09,330
Can you find lines in an image with templates?

4
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:13,830
Including vertical horizontal and diagonal lines.

5
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:15,270
How about faces?

6
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:17,970
Some small, and some large.

7
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:19,810
Icons on a computer screen.

8
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:24,230
Can we use template matching to find cracks and fissures in metal components?

9
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:28,610
This is actually something that computer vision is successfully used for,

10
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:30,420
in real assembly lines.

11
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:33,640
Mark the situations in which you think template matching can be

12
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:34,710
fairly successful.
