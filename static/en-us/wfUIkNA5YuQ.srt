00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:03,050
Here is the full answer for this, solution.

2
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:06,290
You have, or I have, for some things I have truncated the value.

3
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:10,630
Again, if you noticed, the 0 is there because 2 times 28,

4
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:17,610
24 is 48 minus 78 would have been a negative number and I have placed a 0 there.

5
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:20,720
Similarly, the zeros are to kind of account for those negative numbers.

6
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,914
In this case none of the pixels went to full, to 55
