1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,210
So are there any worse problems than undecidable ones?

2
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:06,880
Well, that kind of depends on your subjective view,

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:08,880
but from a perspective of computer science

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,330
undecidability is the biggest and meanest monster of complexity;

5
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:16,420
for a computer, there's no worse thing than

6
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:18,160
"I can't do it."

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,320
Which is undecidability, so the answer here is no,

8
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,330
but that also means

9
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:26,200
that you have completed your journey,

10
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,800
which means that all that remains to be said is

11
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,270
Congratulations for completing our Introduction to Theoretical Computer Science!

12
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:35,700
I consider this to be a rather challenging course,

13
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,400
so you should really be proud of yourself

14
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,150
for having learning so many advanced concepts.

15
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:43,300
You have learned about NP complete problems, some of the toughest problems

16
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:47,090
that are out there, and you have also learned how to recognize these problems,

17
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:49,360
so detecting NP completeness.

18
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,480
You have also learned how to navigate around NP completeness

19
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,610
using techniques such as search trees,

20
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:57,430
pre-processing, fixed parameter tractability,

21
00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:00,250
approximation algorithms, and other techniques

22
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:02,250
such as randomized algorithms,

23
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:05,150
and finally, and this is all but trivial,

24
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:09,330
you now even understand the cliffs of undecidability.

25
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:12,730
I hope I've conveyed to you for many problems

26
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:15,260
that are very, very challenging to solve,

27
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:18,300
digging deeper into underlying algorithms

28
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:20,230
and techniques

29
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:23,260
can really be rewarding, because not only is it fascinating,

30
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:27,390
but actually, problems that to many people will seem unsolvable

31
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:30,230
can be solved using the tools that you've now learned.

32
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:33,890
Theoretical Computer Science or the science of challenging problems

33
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:35,670
is a very rich and deep field

34
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:37,280
and you're no ready to dig deeper.

35
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,980
Whether you want to dig deeper into the theory

36
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:42,210
or you want to dig deeper into writing your own algorithms

37
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:45,470
to solve nearly impossible problems,

38
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:47,610
that is up to you, but in any case,

39
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:49,290
I wish you all the best for that journey,

40
00:01:49,290 --> 99:59:59,999
and once more, congratulations for completing this course.
