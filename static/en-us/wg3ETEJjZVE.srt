1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,443
And the answer is A, this vertical line right here. Since every single point

2
00:00:04,443 --> 00:00:08,932
along a vertical line has the same x-coordinate, but a different y-coordinate,

3
00:00:08,932 --> 00:00:13,230
this definitely doesn't fit the criterion for a function that we've put up.

4
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:17,256
However, for every other curve or line on this graph, each horizontal position

5
00:00:17,256 --> 00:00:21,380
only has one corresponding vertical position. Even though, two of the graphs on

6
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:25,340
here, F and D, don't represent equations that you've seen before, you can still

7
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:29,389
tell, right off the bat, that both of these are functions. Even though you don't

8
00:00:29,389 --> 00:00:30,940
know anything else about them.
