1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:06,150
So I think Charlie was
a great interviewee.

2
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:09,760
I think she did excellent job
at answering my questions.

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,340
She definitely took her time thinking,

4
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:17,280
right, she thought, she didn't feel
rushed trying to answer my questions.

5
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:22,520
And that's very important because it
allowed me to stay connected with her.

6
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:26,660
I think she did an excellent job with
answering the questions in general,

7
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:29,980
she went straight to the answers
which was very good.

8
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:35,320
I think she was very good at
explaining what she was thinking and

9
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:37,470
taking me with her through
the process of getting to the answer,

10
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:39,237
which i think is very important.

11
00:00:39,237 --> 00:00:42,910
There are three things
that she did very well and

12
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:45,460
the first one was guiding me
through her thought process.

13
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:47,590
Whenever I asked her a question
she would not just rush in and

14
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:49,030
start answering.

15
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:52,830
I asked her a SQL question, right,
and she explained exactly what

16
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:55,970
she was going to write before she
even started writing on the board.

17
00:00:55,970 --> 00:01:00,850
Same with a programming question,
she told me how she would solve it.

18
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:03,230
She told me how it's not
the optimal solution.

19
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:07,290
We agreed that it was
a good enough solution.

20
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:07,990
She started writing.

21
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:12,330
I think that those are that
the most important thing

22
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:13,980
to do in a technical interview.

23
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:19,190
And she was very clear with how she
explained which is something that they

24
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:23,610
don't is you need to be very good at I
would look for I want her to be able to

25
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:27,350
explain things to other people
because it's a huge part of our job.

26
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:31,970
The things that she could have worked
on a little bit more was definitely

27
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:33,290
being more familiar with the machine,

28
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:36,770
learning algorithm that she
mentioned during the interview.

29
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:42,540
I think another point where she might
be able to improve a little bit,

30
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:46,940
is when once she saw
the program in question.

31
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,550
When she went to work through examples.

32
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:51,880
It was a bit too fast it was
kind of hard for me to follow.

33
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:55,110
So maybe even making a table of
what a viable look like operation

34
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:56,650
to ration of the for loop.

35
00:01:56,650 --> 00:02:00,790
Might help me be able to keep keep
up with what she was saying and

36
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:02,200
stay connected with her.

37
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,690
And you know I think she
did a good interview.
