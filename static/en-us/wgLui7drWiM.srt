1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,590
So, here I've added some print
statements, and we can see what's going

2
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:07,340
on inside this function when it
gives us these weird results.

3
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:09,450
Hm, location -1.

4
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:10,910
That looks kind of odd.

5
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:14,360
So when the find method doesn't
find sub inside some string,

6
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:19,090
like do isn't inside ding,
it returns -1, but then reusing that

7
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:22,820
value as if it were an actual
location in the string, down here.

8
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:24,970
Looking at these
variables shows us that.

9
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:28,940
Now, really what we should do is
if find doesn't find anything,

10
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:31,410
we could return some string unchanged.

11
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:35,090
Now that we've found the bug, we should
remove the print statements we added.

12
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:37,700
That's one thing you have to be careful
with when you use print statements

13
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:38,610
for debugging.

14
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:40,210
If you don't take them all out,

15
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:42,650
your code will print debugging
information when you don't want it to.
