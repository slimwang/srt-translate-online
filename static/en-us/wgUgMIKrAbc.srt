00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,980
Let's also look at examples of what focal length does in terms of

2
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:06,350
what viewpoint do you want to capture.

3
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:08,550
Here I'm showing two examples.

4
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:11,950
Again, our two friends that have come visited us before, and

5
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:14,360
here I've basically shown two images.

6
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:18,340
This image was captured with a focal length of 18 millimeter on

7
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:19,960
a 35 millimeter sensor.

8
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:22,940
That was a full frame camera.

9
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:25,620
Distance to the first subject is half a meter, and

10
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:27,710
distance to the second subject was two meters.

11
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:34,120
In this case, I used a focal length ten times as larger 180mm.

12
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:37,100
Again, the same camera.

13
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:39,560
And, the distance to the first subject is no longer 0.5,

14
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:42,090
but I moved 2.5 meters away.

15
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:45,856
And, of course, that meant the distance to the second subject is also now

16
00:00:45,856 --> 00:00:48,170
2.5 meters more, 4.5.

17
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:49,480
Exactly the same scene,

18
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:54,070
shot by two different focal lengths with the same camera.

19
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:57,470
And you can note this that each one of them has a different impact.

20
00:00:57,470 --> 00:01:01,210
What this shows is that changing the focal length allows us to move back and

21
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:02,740
still capture the entire scene.

22
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:07,040
But, of course, changing this form of a viewpoint also does change

23
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,240
a perspective change.

24
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,330
For example,

25
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:15,500
these two scientists are appearing to be actually much closer than they are.

26
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:18,620
They are actually almost 1.5 meter apart.

27
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:21,420
But by looking at this image, you can't tell.

28
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:23,880
They almost look to be sitting next to each other.

29
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:27,530
One of the best ways to kind of visualize this is to see the vertigo effect.

30
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:29,450
I recommend you look it up on YouTube.

31
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:32,809
But this kind of scene perspective tricks are widely used in

32
00:01:32,809 --> 00:01:37,777
movies like The Lord of the Rings trilogy, where you could see Gandalf and

33
00:01:37,777 --> 00:01:42,041
Frodo sitting next to each other, but looking much different sizes.

34
00:01:42,041 --> 00:01:46,337
Of course, there's still approximately same human size, but

35
00:01:46,337 --> 00:01:48,495
in case Frodo looks much shorter.

36
00:01:48,495 --> 00:01:52,988
And this is exactly the kinds of tricks that were done in movies like this,

37
00:01:52,988 --> 00:01:55,234
by basically moving farther away and

38
00:01:55,234 --> 00:01:59,809
using a high-focal length lens to kind of show them to be different sizes.

39
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:05,020
So this is the kind of tricks again that are widely used in movie industry.

40
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:08,610
But just by changing the focal length we can actually change the perspective

41
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:09,195
and the viewpoint.
