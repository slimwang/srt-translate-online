1
00:00:00,005 --> 00:00:08,214
1.2 times 4 is 4.8. We multiple this by 10th to the 15, since 8 plus 7 is 15.

2
00:00:08,214 --> 00:00:12,790
There's one important thing we need to note here. Using this method, your

3
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:17,145
answer is not always going to end up in scientific notation, since sometimes,

4
00:00:17,145 --> 00:00:21,433
depending what two numbers we have multiplied here, this number won't end up

5
00:00:21,433 --> 00:00:26,890
being between 1 and 10. So, make sure that if you decide to use this method,

6
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:29,725
you look at the final answer and double check that it is in fact in scientific

7
00:00:29,725 --> 00:00:34,029
notation. If it's not, adjust it properly.
