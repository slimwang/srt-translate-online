00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:04,670
Heroin is a drug that is often abused for its powerful pain relieving effects,

2
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:10,424
both physical and psychological, as well as the euphoria. However, tolerance

3
00:00:10,424 --> 00:00:13,700
develops to the effects of heroin, and that requires the user to take more of

4
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:19,060
the drug to produce those similar effects. In addition, once the heroin addict

5
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:22,260
is physically dependent When the drug starts to leave their system, they'll

6
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:27,291
experience withdrawal symptoms. Thus, the life of a heroin addict is a vicious

7
00:00:27,291 --> 00:00:33,096
cycle, spent injecting the drug. Experiencing effects. And when that starts to

8
00:00:33,096 --> 00:00:37,240
wear off, they're going to seek to find the drug again. Often times, this

9
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:42,080
resolves in criminal activity in an attempt to purchase the drug. Now, heroin

10
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:45,419
is not used here medically in the United States, but other powerful opiates

11
00:00:45,419 --> 00:00:50,686
are. However, although some people do abuse the opioids, it's important to

12
00:00:50,686 --> 00:00:55,770
stress the value of these pain-relieving agents. From a medicinal point of

13
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:59,868
view, these are essential for managing individuals who experience pain. Now,

14
00:00:59,868 --> 00:01:04,422
the opiates produce their effects by interacting with our mu, delta, and kappa

15
00:01:04,422 --> 00:01:10,780
receptors and they act similar to our endogenous endorphins and enkephalins.

16
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:16,372
People often die from overdosing on these drugs by respiratory depression. Now,

17
00:01:16,372 --> 00:01:18,866
I'm going to send it back to Lauren and we're going to discuss the next drug,

18
00:01:18,866 --> 00:01:19,940
cannabis.
