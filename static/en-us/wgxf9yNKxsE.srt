1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Where the product goes and see the box labeled value proposition.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
As was simulated, the value proposition includes all the features of your product

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
but also the pains and gains you're solving for the customer segment

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
and that's where the market goes.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 99:59:59,999
The market includes where your customers are and what problems you're solving for them.
