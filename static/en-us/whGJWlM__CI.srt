1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:04,130
So you've decided that you need
more than what can be provided by

2
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:06,190
all the variance of Roboto.

3
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:08,370
How do you pick an additional font?

4
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:10,080
Well, it's pretty hard.

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,260
Choosing the right font isn't
only a technical challenge.

6
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:16,059
It's not enough to just pick
a font that's easy to read and

7
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:18,690
contrasts well with
the content around it.

8
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:23,200
Your choice of font can impact
how your users perceive your app.

9
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:26,000
And how they emotionally respond to it.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,420
Hand written fonts or

11
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:32,369
fonts with rounded terminals can
make your app feel informal.

12
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:37,040
On the other hand, very geometric fonts
might give an impression of order and

13
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,210
structure.

14
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:41,550
And some fonts might even feel robotic.

15
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:43,800
Weight matters too here.

16
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,860
Light fonts are those
with really thin serafs,

17
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:50,800
can invoke impressions of elegance,
but also impermanence.

18
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,970
Meanwhile ultra bolds
might evoke heaviness.

19
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:59,880
But possibly stability, and fonts can
even be associated with a time period.

20
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:03,470
While some may have an almost
historic significance,

21
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:06,930
others may be considered
a little too trendy.

22
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:10,930
There really aren't great absolute rules
for choosing the right custom font for

23
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:14,140
your app, but here are a couple
of tips that might prove handy.

24
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,800
First, limit your font pallet.

25
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:20,940
You can often get away with
using just one custom font for

26
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:25,790
branding areas like your app bar and
Roboto for everything else.

27
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:29,330
If you do pick another sans
sarif font to replace Roboto for

28
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:33,950
UI elements like the text here,
make sure to switch over completely.

29
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:37,760
So you don't have two similar
looking fonts next to each other.

30
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:40,660
Here Helvetica and
Roboto are placed next to each other.

31
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:46,250
But since they look kind of similar,
it's kind of this weird uncanny valley.

32
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:48,420
It's not clear if it's intentional or
not.

33
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:53,720
Second, try out the font you're thinking
of on a couple of different devices with

34
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,720
varying screen densities.

35
00:01:55,720 --> 00:02:01,440
What looks awesome at xxhdpi
might look really muddy at mdpi.

36
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:04,780
Notice the serifs on the H
are barely even visible.

37
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:09,360
And finally, watch out for
unintended cognitive dissonance.

38
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,840
And make sure the font fits
the mood you're setting in the app.

39
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,860
If your product is all about being fast,
putting a font with a heavy weight on

40
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:20,400
might give the feeling of
a slow lumbering giant.

41
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,220
On the other hand, if you have
an app that's highly technical

42
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:26,930
an overly decorative font might
not only be distracting but

43
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:30,760
might erode your user's trust
in what you're trying to do.

44
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:36,090
So does your proposed extra custom
font meet all those requirements?

45
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:36,970
Great.

46
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:39,710
James is going to walk you through
how to use the font you just

47
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:40,450
picked in your app.
