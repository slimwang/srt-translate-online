00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:04,750
Up to this point, we've only made
simple style changes to our web pages

2
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:06,350
by changing the font color.

3
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:09,350
But there are many other properties
that you can change using CSS.

4
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:11,980
In fact, there are hundreds, and

5
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:14,410
the list of properties
is constantly growing.

6
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:15,440
Not only that, but

7
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,940
remembering the correct values to pass
to each property can be a nightmare.

8
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:24,880
Thankfully there are resources like
Mozilla's CSS reference or CSS tricks,

9
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:29,770
CSS almanac that give us the entire
listing of standard CSS properties, and

10
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:31,710
their acceptable values.

11
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:33,750
There's always Google too.

12
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:38,009
In the next exercise I want you to get
comfortable with using CSS references.

13
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,990
I've listed a couple of
questions to get you started.

14
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:47,200
What CSS properties are used
to italicize, underline,

15
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,890
uppercase, and bold text?

16
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:54,060
If you get stuck check below for
links to some different CSS references.
