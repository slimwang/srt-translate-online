1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:02,300
So in our polar representation,

2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:06,380
this purplish line here is going to
be defined by two quantities.

3
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:08,720
One of them is just this distance, d.

4
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:13,098
This is the distance of a line to
the origin, the perpendicular distance.

5
00:00:13,098 --> 00:00:16,500
It's the distant to the closest
point on the line to the origin.

6
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,780
And the second parameter, so
that first parameter is d, and

7
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:20,650
the second parameter's theta.

8
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:22,240
which is just the angle,

9
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:27,630
that this perpendicular makes with
the x-axis, or if you want, you

10
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:31,450
can have it be the angle that the line
makes with the axis, doesn't matter.

11
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:33,310
You just have to pick an angle.

12
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:37,710
So basically what we have now is
a polar representation of an angle.

13
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:39,120
And a distance.

14
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,230
In such a representation,
by doing just a little bit of math,

15
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:48,220
you can basically see that the dot
product of any point on the line xy.

16
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:54,330
Dotted with the cosine theta, sine theta
location of this normal is equal to d.

17
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:57,570
There's a lot of ways to do it but
basically you can show that if you

18
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:02,740
formulate it this way, that x
cosine(theta) + y sine(theta) = d.

19
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:05,319
So it's a lot, not a lot,
it's a little bit ugly.

20
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:07,630
Well, it's beautiful if
you like trigonometry.

21
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:09,710
It's ugly if you like algebra.

22
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:13,070
It's a little bit more ugly than
the y equals mx plus b formulation.

23
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:16,230
But it doesn't have this problem that
any of our lines are ill-defined.

24
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:19,060
This is a perfectly fine way
of representing any line.

25
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:20,670
You can have any direction you want.

26
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:22,930
Theta can go however it wants to go.

27
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:24,970
And you can be,
you can go right through the origin.

28
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:28,630
D can be zero, or
it can get as big as you need it to go.

29
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:33,420
One of the interesting things now is
if you take a look at this equation.

30
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:39,460
If I know x and y, what I have
left in terms of d and theta.

31
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:42,030
Is a sinusoid, all right?

32
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:47,010
Which is why we say that a point in
image space is now a sinusoid in Hough

33
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:48,900
space, and we'll see an example
of that in a minute.

34
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:53,010
See, before, we had this beautiful
duality of a point in image space was

35
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:57,800
a line in Hough space, and a point in
Hough space was a line in image space.

36
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:01,040
Well, because we've introduced this
cosines and sines, it's still a duality,

37
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,170
but it's no longer simply
between points and lines.

38
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:09,280
One other comment about this, there's
a redundancy or an ambiguity here.

39
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,400
Let me draw it to you this way.

40
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,570
Here's d, so

41
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:17,720
if d can only be positive, this line has
to be able to spin all the way around.

42
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:22,340
So theta would have to go from zero
to two pi, zero to 360 degrees.

43
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:25,562
But If d could be positive or negative.

44
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:31,700
Then theta only has to
go from zero to pi.

45
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:33,748
Or zero to minus pi and
how you draw that.

46
00:02:33,748 --> 00:02:36,660
The idea is you'd only need
a 180 degrees worth of coverage.

47
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:39,200
Which way you do it
doesn't really matter and

48
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,200
our algorithm will do
it in a particular way.

49
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,730
But there's just this trade-off
between if you let d go positive

50
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:49,000
to negative top has it negative
then only it has to go zero to pi.

51
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,860
In fact,
you can restrict things even more

52
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:55,580
if you make this be the origin of
your image, the top left-hand corner.

53
00:02:55,580 --> 00:03:01,505
If you're going to say that your
line has to be within the image.

54
00:03:01,505 --> 00:03:03,480
Okay?
Then that restricts even more

55
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:07,800
because it has to cut off that quadrant,
so theta and d are restricted even more.

56
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,440
But these are just choices that
you make in terms of how you code

57
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,010
up the algorithm.
