1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:04,570
The critical values for this inequality are x equals 3 halves, and x equals 5.

2
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:08,173
So this splits the number line into three different intervals. Lets pick a

3
00:00:08,173 --> 00:00:13,000
value from each interval and test it. From over here on the left, I'll pick 0.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,976
And if I plug that in, I end up with a negative number over a negative number,

5
00:00:15,976 --> 00:00:21,140
or a positive number which is greater than 0. So yes, this interval checks off.

6
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:24,542
If I pick a number in this middle region, like three, then they'll end up with

7
00:00:24,542 --> 00:00:28,106
a positive number over a negative number, which makes a negative number, which

8
00:00:28,106 --> 00:00:34,140
is not greater than 0. So this interval does not work. Over on the right,

9
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:38,520
plugging in six for x does check out. So this region should be shaded as well.

10
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:42,920
On a number line then, our solution looks like this. With of course, rounded

11
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:47,393
open brackets showing that 5 and 3 halves are not included. Written as an

12
00:00:47,393 --> 00:00:51,362
inequality then, our solution should be x is less than 3 halves joined with x

13
00:00:51,362 --> 00:00:53,693
is greater than 5.
