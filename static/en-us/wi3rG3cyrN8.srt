1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
What am I going to do next? Well, guess what? I'm going to add more vertices.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
And this this time I'm going to add 8 vertices, and I'm now going to connect them

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
this way, always groups of 3. And guess what I'm going

4
00:00:14,000 --> 99:59:59,999
to ask you now? How many vertices does greedy choose?
