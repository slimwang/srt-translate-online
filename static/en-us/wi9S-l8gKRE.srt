00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:03,040
I'm not going to walk through
this solution step by step, and

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:07,350
I hope that most of this code that you
see here has become pretty routine.

3
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:08,450
Let's just go down to the bottom.

4
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:11,760
Keep going.

5
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:14,040
Here, we store the user ID
in our app delegate, and

6
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:17,730
then we call the complete login method,
to go to the next view.

7
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:19,527
So let's test this and see what happens.

8
00:00:26,773 --> 00:00:28,906
I'll enter my credentials and
click log in.

9
00:00:31,043 --> 00:00:31,950
And there we go.

10
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:35,730
We've completed the authentication
flow plus we've gotten the user ID.

11
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:38,340
And we're here in our main tab view.

12
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:42,190
And for fun I'll go to the favorites
tab just to see if the movies that I've

13
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:45,050
already selected as favorites
on the website show up here.

14
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,750
And there they are.

15
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:51,060
Next we're going to tackle our
first post request to favorite and

16
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:52,100
unfavorite movies.
