Let's walk through graphing a different linear inequality. When we graph a

2
00:00:03,825 --> 00:00:07,804
linear inequality we want to start by graphing a boundary line. The boundary

3
00:00:07,804 --> 00:00:11,788
line would be made up of the points if this inequality were an equation. I want

4
00:00:11,788 --> 00:00:15,756
you to use your knowledge of slope and the Y intercept to figure which of these

5
00:00:15,756 --> 00:00:19,235
points would be on the boundary line. Check all of them that apply.
