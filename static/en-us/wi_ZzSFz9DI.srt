00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,980
As you just discovered,
changes to opacity and

2
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:07,140
transform only trigger composite when
the elements are on their own layers.

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:10,840
But remember, Paul also had to use
clip to reverse the animation.

4
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:13,180
And that, unfortunately, requires paint.

5
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:16,640
It's important to always understand
the implications of any property you

6
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,060
choose to animate, because some
are definitely cheaper than others.
