00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:03,630
So how would you use the notion of understanding [UNKNOWN] frames, constraint,

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:07,390
and ambiguity to address Raven's progressive matrices? One example of

3
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:10,390
an application here, would be to the idea of multiple possible transformations,

4
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:12,290
that we saw in some of our earlier problems.

5
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:15,000
We saw certain problems that could be solved with either rotation or

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,700
a reflection, but they would give different answers. You might imagine a frame

7
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:21,800
that dictates certain expected values for different transformations. And

8
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:25,050
the degree of fit to those expectations can dictate the accuracy of that

9
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:28,480
particular answer. Try to think of the different phases of the understanding

10
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,550
process. How do you first understand what's happening in the problem?

11
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:34,975
How do you fit that, into a thematically role frame representation? And

12
00:00:34,975 --> 00:00:37,900
how would that representation then help you transfer and solve the problem?
