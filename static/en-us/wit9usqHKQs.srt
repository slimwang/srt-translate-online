00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,130
So let's see if we can correctly use MSYNC.

2
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:04,710
Let's say that we have a processor with a

3
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:09,010
very relaxed consistency model where all four reorderings are

4
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:13,150
allowed. Including reodering writes to different locations on a core.

5
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:14,760
Let's say that this is the code we are

6
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:19,380
executing. We do a load link of lock into R1.

7
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:21,990
We then do a branch if we didn't get

8
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:26,130
the lock, back to checking, we do a store conditional

9
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:31,470
trying to now get the lock. We look back, if we didn't get the lock then we

10
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:36,870
load the variable incremented and store it. Then we free the lock by writing

11
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:44,650
zero to it. So the question for you is where do we need MSYNC if anywhere here?

12
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:50,430
Do we need one here? Do we need on here? Do we need on

13
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:55,987
here? Here? Here? How bout here? How bout here?

14
00:00:55,987 --> 00:01:01,790
How bout here? And how bout at the end of everything?
