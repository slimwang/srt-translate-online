1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,932
For this problem, we also take a function 4 n squared, plus

2
00:00:03,932 --> 00:00:07,500
log n to the seventh power plus 9 n times log n

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:11,440
squared plus n to the two thirds power. And state whether it's

4
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:15,030
a number of different sets. Specified by theta and big O notation.
