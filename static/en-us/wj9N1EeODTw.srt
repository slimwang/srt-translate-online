00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,083
For pairs of sets of data, like we have in this situation, there's a special

2
00:00:04,094 --> 00:00:08,132
sort of notation that we use to help us get ready to graph. So, in this column,

3
00:00:08,144 --> 00:00:12,256
I have a set of values that d could equal. And then, in the column next to it, I

4
00:00:12,268 --> 00:00:16,221
have a set of values that n will equal, whenever d equals the values to the

5
00:00:16,233 --> 00:00:20,274
left. To show which values in either column fit together, I write them inside

6
00:00:20,286 --> 00:00:24,345
parentheses together with a comma in between. The reason this helps us with the

7
00:00:24,357 --> 00:00:28,422
graphing is that traditionally, the number that comes first corresponds to the

8
00:00:28,434 --> 00:00:32,094
horizontal value, or the horizontal coordinate of the point that we're going to

9
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,346
draw. And the number that comes next corresponds to the vertical value of the

10
00:00:36,358 --> 00:00:41,110
point, or the vertical coordinate. So, thinking about how ordered pairs

11
00:00:41,122 --> 00:00:46,270
translate into graphing, where does the point 5,115 belong?
