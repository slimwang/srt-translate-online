1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,770
There are two different kinds
of in-game currency you can

2
00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:07,680
use to purchase in-app items,
soft currency and hard currency.

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,390
Soft currency is easy to get and
is often used to pay for

4
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:15,940
consumables, whereas hard currency
is more difficult to get and

5
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:19,130
is used to get rare items or
entitlements.

6
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:23,090
Soft currency is easy to get
because it's very grindable.

7
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:26,450
And grindable just means that you can
play parts of the game like levels or

8
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:30,470
mini games over and
over again to accumulate soft currency.

9
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:32,400
So the more time you
spend playing a game,

10
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,060
the more soft currency
you slowly accumulate.

11
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:39,390
One example of this is
Fruit Ninja's starfruit currency.

12
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:42,610
Players accumulate starfruit
over time as they play the game.

13
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:46,620
And once they save up enough, they can
use these starfruits to buy consumables

14
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:49,200
like bomb deflects or game power-ups.

15
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,170
Hard currency is between real money and
soft currency.

16
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:57,270
It's difficult to earn and can also
usually be bought with real money.

17
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:59,630
Like we mentioned before,
it's often used to pay for

18
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:01,970
entitlements or other rare items.

19
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:05,330
In Fruit Ninja golden
apples are hard currency.

20
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:08,310
You can only earn them by
paying real money for them or

21
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:10,520
by watching offer wall adds.

22
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:14,340
These apples are used to unlock
levels in tournament challenges.

23
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,540
So if you want a fun
multiplayer challenge,

24
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:19,270
you'll have to pay hard currency for
that entitlement.

25
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:21,820
Let's look at some other
examples of in-game currencies.
