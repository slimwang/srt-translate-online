1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:01,150
Okay.

2
00:00:01,150 --> 00:00:04,150
Let's start by looking at what
each of these platforms offer.

3
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:07,480
Google Cast provides a simple
sender receiver typology

4
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:10,720
which allows developers to
create multi device experiences

5
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:14,790
integrated with their existing
apps on Android, iOS, and the web.

6
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:19,650
Android TV simply takes Android and
brings it into the living room.

7
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:22,990
This makes it a deal for
extending your existing Android app

8
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:27,240
to work in the living room whether or
not the user has their phone on them.

9
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:31,490
You can integrate your service or
app with Google Cast, Android TV, or

10
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:32,659
even better both.

11
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:37,550
Where to start and how to go further
depends on the type of service and

12
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:40,000
what platforms are already integrated.

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,498
In many case you can then extend
to cover multiple platforms for

14
00:00:43,498 --> 00:00:44,818
the greatest impact and

15
00:00:44,818 --> 00:00:48,778
best user experience regardless of
what the user has driving their TV.

16
00:00:48,778 --> 00:00:52,810
The most common use case I hear
talked about is streaming media.

17
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:57,210
Whether your app is on Android, iOS or
web your first step in building for

18
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:00,510
the living room is adding in
Google Cast functionality.

19
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:04,444
Now this will ensure your users will
be able to stream on all Google Cast

20
00:01:04,444 --> 00:01:07,458
ready devices including chrome cast and
Android TV.

21
00:01:07,458 --> 00:01:11,309
Once you've finished adding Google Cast
support you can then extend your Android

22
00:01:11,309 --> 00:01:13,350
app using your lean back library.

23
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:17,450
Allowing your users to launch and
control the app from their Android TV.

24
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:20,500
Beyond this common use case,
it really depends what platform you're

25
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:24,780
already working on and therefore the
platform from which you're extending.

26
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,670
If you've already got an Android app,

27
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:31,490
it can most easily be extended with a
lean back library to work on Android TV.

28
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:34,420
In fact, many Android apps for
the phone, tablet, and

29
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:37,470
TV will all be bundled
in the same app package,

30
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:40,320
which simplifies the Google Play
experience for users.

31
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,170
In essence, the TV is just
another form factor for your app.

32
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:47,950
If you've got a web app, it can most
easily be extended to the living room by

33
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:50,150
using the Google Cast platform.

34
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:52,660
The Chrome API takes care
of rendering the app and

35
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:54,700
then streaming that content
to the Cast device.

36
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:59,880
If you've already got an iOS app, it can
also easily be extended to the living

37
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:02,960
room by using the Google Cast SDK for
iOS.
