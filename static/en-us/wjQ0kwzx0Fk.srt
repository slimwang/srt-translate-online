00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,325
Let's rewrite this just like we saw before. We can write it instead as 8 over 2

2
00:00:04,325 --> 00:00:10,310
times 10 to the 20 times 10 to the 8. This gives us 4, and here, we have 10 to

3
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:15,822
the 20 minus 8 or 10 to the 12th. So scientific notation gives us a great way

4
00:00:15,822 --> 00:00:20,820
to deal with very small and very large numbers. Numbers expressing the vastness

5
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:24,785
of the universe, numbers expressing tiny cells in the body. There're are even

6
00:00:24,785 --> 00:00:28,669
smaller quantities around us, the building blocks of everything. A scientific

7
00:00:28,669 --> 00:00:30,929
notation is also very useful for describing.
