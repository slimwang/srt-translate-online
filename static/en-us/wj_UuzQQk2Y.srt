00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,230
Light mapping is a way of lighting objects to make them look highly realistic,

2
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:07,124
or for that matter highly stylized. For static objects in particular, those

3
00:00:07,124 --> 00:00:10,114
that aren't moving, the idea is to pre-compute shadows, reflected light, and

4
00:00:10,114 --> 00:00:14,345
any other lighting effects desired. For example, you can see in this scene that

5
00:00:14,345 --> 00:00:18,520
the smaller cube has a subtle realistic shadow effect on the larger one. This

6
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:22,146
type of effect is difficult to compute at interactive rates. This is how the

7
00:00:22,146 --> 00:00:26,100
process works. First, here's a scene without any lighting applied. Every

8
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:29,820
surface is assigned an additional texture called a light map. This extra

9
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,410
texture will be used to capture the light's effect. Some offline process is

10
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:37,213
done to the illumination in the scene. As much time as desired, can then be

11
00:00:37,213 --> 00:00:41,078
spent determining how much light reaches each pixel on each surface. The

12
00:00:41,078 --> 00:00:45,090
results are stored in the light map. The light map is a mosaic texture, holding

13
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:49,260
many different surfaces' illumination calculations. For example, the lower left

14
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:52,545
corner of this light map is for the ground plane. You can see the two shadows

15
00:00:52,545 --> 00:00:56,213
of the cubes laying on it. When the objects are displayed, the fragment shader

16
00:00:56,213 --> 00:00:59,381
takes the object's color texture and multiplies it by the corresponding light

17
00:00:59,381 --> 00:01:04,269
map texture. This gives the surface an illuminated look. Here's the final

18
00:01:04,269 --> 00:01:07,792
result. Note that it's the same or darker than the original image without

19
00:01:07,792 --> 00:01:11,472
illumination. This is why light maps are sometimes half jokingly called dark

20
00:01:11,472 --> 00:01:15,011
maps, since they lessen the overall light. In theory you could bake the

21
00:01:15,011 --> 00:01:18,001
lighting into each color texture itself instead of using a separate light map

22
00:01:18,001 --> 00:01:23,245
texture. While possible, this can quickly get expensive. One major advantage of

23
00:01:23,245 --> 00:01:26,035
light maps is that they can have a much lower resolution than the texture on

24
00:01:26,035 --> 00:01:28,780
the surface itself, and can be stored in a single color channel instead of

25
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:33,649
three. Rather than storing six high resolution textures per cube in this scene,

26
00:01:33,649 --> 00:01:36,785
each with the lighting baked in, just one texture and six small light maps are

27
00:01:36,785 --> 00:01:39,040
stored for each.
