00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,870
One of the surprising things about network speed is that a

2
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:05,100
lot of what determines the end to end speed of a

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:08,560
network in practice is not the throughput, how fast you can

4
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:11,730
push bits through the channel, but the latency, the time it takes

5
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:14,240
to get a response from the other end. Let's take a

6
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:19,130
look at where that latency comes from. For each HTTP request, even

7
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:22,070
after we've gotten the radio to wake up, we have to

8
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:25,420
do a DNS lookup to figure out what that domain name server

9
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:28,100
actually means in terms of IP number. We have

10
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:30,830
to make a socket connection to that site. We

11
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:33,920
have to actually send the HTTP request and then

12
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,120
we actually get our data back. Each one of

13
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:39,990
these steps takes time. On an LTE network, each

14
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:43,480
one of these requests takes between 240 and 500

15
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:46,270
milliseconds, depending on whether we already have a connection

16
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:50,680
going or not. On 3G, each request will take 600

17
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:56,280
milliseconds to 3.5 seconds, that's per every HTTP request.
