1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,469
There's pretty much a limited number of
factors on reasons why people are going

2
00:00:03,469 --> 00:00:06,792
to upgrade to pay you for the service.

3
00:00:06,792 --> 00:00:09,810
For us,

4
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:13,850
we had multiple tiers or pressure
points that we had set up in the plan.

5
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:16,070
It's going to be, for the early plans,

6
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:20,100
how many forms are you going to need,
if you wanted user management.

7
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:23,210
For example, if you were wanting to
have multiple people on your team have

8
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:26,860
access to the resources at hand,
you could easily charge by that.

9
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:29,880
How many entries or
data that you're going to process,

10
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:33,830
which made sort of sense and
then certain features that you wanted.

11
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:34,440
For example,

12
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:39,230
payment integration was one that would
only be available on the higher planes.

13
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:42,930
The idea was, the reason that you
stratify on all these different areas

14
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:45,670
is because different users
will pay different things.

15
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:49,580
In a product that was generalized as
Wufoo, there's lots of industries,

16
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:52,690
markets and verticals, different
people had different pressure points.

17
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:57,080
Our goal around the features was making
sure people got to try before they buy.

18
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:59,650
Seeing entries, being able to
build the form, that was fine but

19
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:02,570
like payment integration was only
available on a middle tier plan but

20
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:05,260
we wanted even free users
to be able to try it out.

21
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:08,140
We would figure out ways to say,
for five transactions,

22
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:11,080
you can try it out for yourself to
see what it's going to be like.

23
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:14,980
Having your own custom theme or
logo, people care very much about I

24
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:18,350
want this to be a part of my identity,
and it was a big difference for Wufoo.

25
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:19,820
What we tried to do was,

26
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:22,450
in all the different ways that people
might be pressured to upgrade,

27
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:25,660
we tried to build that inside of Wufoo,
and made it really obvious.

28
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:28,630
Then it made sense that most
people would send around

29
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:31,410
the first plan that had one
set of unlimited features,

30
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:33,850
which would be unlimited
forms on the middle plan.

31
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:36,580
The reason you also have
multiple pricing plans

32
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:40,950
is because you don't know what the
average revenue per user is going to be.

33
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:46,110
If you could predict ahead of time
that the average revenue per user is

34
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:49,980
going to be, let's say, $25, then you
could just have one pricing plan.

35
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:52,550
It's free and then it's going to be this
because that's about what it's going to

36
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:54,390
be and
that makes things a lot simpler but

37
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:56,400
you don't know what that's
ultimately going to be.

38
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:00,440
So you have this grid, it's why people
set it up, to capture that cost but

39
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:05,039
some people, again, if you're
going consumer versus going B2B,

40
00:02:05,039 --> 00:02:08,400
people have different
price sensitivities.

41
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:11,218
For us, we thought it was like this
is going to be both consumer and

42
00:02:11,218 --> 00:02:13,980
B2B, and that was the case for us but

43
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:16,980
it heavily skewed that most of
our paying customers are all B2B.

44
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:20,080
We had lots of people individually
using the free plans but

45
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,560
what would end up happening
is those people and

46
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:24,700
their free plans were our biggest
word of mouth growth people.

47
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:28,070
We made sure that Wufoo with the users
on the free plan, we made it easy for

48
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:31,825
them to talk about our services,
share with other people and do all this,

49
00:02:31,825 --> 00:02:34,818
because that's who is going to be our
champions on the individual side.

50
00:02:34,818 --> 00:02:39,060
On the B2B side, it's usually like
they're spending someone else's money,

51
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:41,280
someone else's budget, so
they're less price sensitive.

52
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,406
All they care about is does
this help me get things done?

53
00:02:43,406 --> 00:02:46,940
A lot of the emphasis there is look,
with one click this is just going to

54
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:49,540
work, with one click you
are going to install this template,

55
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:52,480
with two seconds you are going to
have this feature ready for you and

56
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,260
you are don't have to
worry about this anymore.

57
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:55,570
It's all about that convenience and

58
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:58,850
saving of time, and it's no going to
cost you nothing, especially for

59
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:02,990
people wanting payment integration,
this is going to pay for itself really,

60
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:05,670
really quickly and
then showing that evidence of that.
