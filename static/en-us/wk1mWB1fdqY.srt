1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,110
Okay, so we've now seen an abstract example of

2
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:05,420
decision trees. So let's make certain that we understand

3
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:08,270
it with a concrete example. So, to your right

4
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:12,780
is a specific decision tree that looks at some of

5
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:15,010
the features that we talked about. Whether you are

6
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:18,280
occupied or not, whether the restaurant is occupied or not

7
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:21,364
what type of restaurant it is. Your choices are

8
00:00:21,364 --> 00:00:25,250
pizza, Thai, or other. And whether the people inside look

9
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:29,300
happy or not. The possible outputs are again binary

10
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:33,180
either you don't go or you do go, into

11
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:36,610
the restaurant. On your left is a table which

12
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:40,210
has six of the features that we've talked about. Whether

13
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:42,060
the restaurant is occupied or not, the type of

14
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:44,990
restaurant, whether it's raining outside or not, whether your hungry

15
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:46,970
or not. Whether you're on a hot and whether

16
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:50,310
the people inside look happy, and some values for each

17
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:53,300
of those. And what we would like for you to do is to

18
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:56,320
tell us what the output of this decision tree would be in each case.

19
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,970
>> Alright, so the decision tree here is a, it's

20
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:01,250
a classifier, but we had another name. Oh, it's a concept.

21
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:01,610
>> Yes.

22
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:04,810
>> Alright, and each row of this is a different time that

23
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:08,970
we're stopping at a restaurant, and the, the little values there summarize what

24
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:12,740
is true about this particular situation. And, and you're saying we need

25
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:15,740
to then trace through this decision tree and figure out what class is,

26
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:17,200
okay yeah, that's what you said. Okay, I'm

27
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,670
ready. Alright, perfect. Okay, that's the quiz, go.
