1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,400
In this task we're going to make
changes to the code Jake just wrote.

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:06,180
So you want to get your
project into the same shape.

3
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:10,006
You can run get reset hard to
remove any local changes you have.

4
00:00:10,006 --> 00:00:14,020
Then run get checkout task IDP people,

5
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:16,790
to get the project into
the same shape as Jake's.

6
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:19,140
Once again,
we're editing the IDB script so

7
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:25,724
head over to public/js/idbtest/index.js.

8
00:00:25,724 --> 00:00:30,600
We just saw Jake creating an index
to sort people by favorite animal.

9
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:33,542
But your job is to create an index
where they're ordered by age.

10
00:00:33,542 --> 00:00:37,350
So in the upgrade function,
you'll need to create your index.

11
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:38,700
Then at the bottom of the script,

12
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:42,150
write some code to log out
all the people in that order.

13
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:44,540
Once you're done, refresh the browser.

14
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:47,300
You should see the names
log out in order.

15
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:49,540
You can also confirm in dev tools.

16
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:53,106
To double check everything is working,
head to the settings page and

17
00:00:53,106 --> 00:00:55,698
type IDB age into the test
field then press enter.
