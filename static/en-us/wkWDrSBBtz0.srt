1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:04,539
I think that is the most important
question of an interview,

2
00:00:04,539 --> 00:00:06,042
any good interview so

3
00:00:06,042 --> 00:00:11,568
you can examine how they dealt with a
project from beginning to start, right?

4
00:00:11,568 --> 00:00:15,306
So you want to to see how they are
proficient what is the problem how can

5
00:00:15,306 --> 00:00:18,305
they describe a problem,
is very important, right?

6
00:00:18,305 --> 00:00:20,700
And then how they approach
to actually solving it and

7
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:23,730
what things they consider
while solving it.

8
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:28,469
Then you also want to make sure they use
some tools that are their standard for

9
00:00:28,469 --> 00:00:29,446
the industry.

10
00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:31,995
I think it's the most
important question and for

11
00:00:31,995 --> 00:00:35,726
anybody that is going to be going into
an interview they should always be

12
00:00:35,726 --> 00:00:37,610
prepared to answer that question.

13
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:41,894
I think she did an excellent job in
describing the problem in saying and

14
00:00:41,894 --> 00:00:44,058
explaining the interface and
you have for the project.

15
00:00:44,058 --> 00:00:48,410
I think she could have explain a little
bit more the technical side, so

16
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:53,250
separated the problem from the solution
from the learning a little bit more so

17
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:55,640
that I could understand
a little bit better.

18
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:57,560
But overall I think
the candidate did very well.
