1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,050
UIKit is a big library.

2
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:05,420
We won't be covering all of its classes,
but we've selected a path through

3
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:08,360
the material that will give you
a strong foundation to build on.

4
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:11,330
We'll be covering, outlets and actions,

5
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:16,230
presenting view controllers,
delegates, tables, navigation, and

6
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:19,350
we'll wrap up with some skills you'll
need specifically for the MemeMe app.

7
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:23,150
In this first lesson we want
to take a close look at

8
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:25,640
each object that's
used to create an app.

9
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:27,880
We'll write an app entirely in code, and

10
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:31,490
then we'll see how storyboard can
be used to replace that code.

11
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:36,270
To begin, let's develop a way to diagram
objects, so that we can visualize our

12
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:38,630
apps' components and
see how they're connected.
