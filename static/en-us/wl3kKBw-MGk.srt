1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:02,780
So, we're familiar with the problem.

2
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:06,500
Zero connectivity is a bad experience,
low connectivity is,

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:11,630
well maddening and previously there
was nothing you could do about it.

4
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:15,630
All you could do is make a request and
then it's entirely out of your hands.

5
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:20,180
It might work, it might not,
it might be fast, but it might not.

6
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:23,100
You have zero control until
the request succeeds.

7
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:24,770
If it even succeeds.

8
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:28,630
Well, that story changes with
a relatively new browser feature

9
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:31,630
called service worker, and that's-
>> Wait, Jake.

10
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:32,509
>> What?

11
00:00:32,509 --> 00:00:33,890
>> Was that it?

12
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:35,510
>> Was what, what?

13
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:37,710
>> This is the feature
that solves everything,

14
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:40,840
the feature that gives developers
new powers over the network.

15
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,950
You could at least introduce
it a bit better than that.

16
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:44,770
>> How do you mean?

17
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:45,700
>> Well.

18
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:51,050
>> For too long, users have been
left staring at a white screen.

19
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:58,120
For too long, they've been let down by
the cruel seas of network connectivity.

20
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:02,525
And for
too long we've been powerless to help.

21
00:01:02,525 --> 00:01:05,558
[MUSIC]

22
00:01:05,558 --> 00:01:06,880
We've been left waiting.

23
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:14,530
But no longer.

24
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:17,038
[MUSIC]

25
00:01:17,038 --> 00:01:20,120
A new browser feature has arrived.

26
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:24,200
A total game changer.

27
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,784
[MUSIC]

28
00:01:27,784 --> 00:01:32,251
A feature that lets you control
the network rather than letting

29
00:01:32,251 --> 00:01:34,110
the network control you.

30
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,710
Who is this new feature?

31
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:43,250
What promises does it bring?

32
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:50,675
Introducing The Service Worker.

33
00:01:50,675 --> 00:02:00,082
[MUSIC]

34
00:02:00,082 --> 00:02:02,760
>> Yeah okay, that was pretty good.

35
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:05,472
I'm British you see.
I'm physically incapable of positivity

36
00:02:05,472 --> 00:02:07,380
and excitement.

37
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:09,830
>> Well, I still like you,
Britishness and all.

38
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:11,470
>> Well, thank you.

39
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:14,723
>> And listen, if that wasn't compelling
enough for you to stick with us for

40
00:02:14,723 --> 00:02:16,517
the next lesson, I don't know what is.

41
00:02:16,517 --> 00:02:19,000
So strap in and
click through to the next lesson.

42
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,840
Let's drag the web into
the world of offline first.

43
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:27,260
>> Yeah, what he said, let's do this.
