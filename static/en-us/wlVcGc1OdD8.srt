00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,050
Hey there and welcome to Networking For
Web Developers.

2
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:05,760
In this course you'll learn a bunch
about how the internet works and

3
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:09,250
how applying that working knowledge can
help you make your web apps better.

4
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:14,050
As a web developer you may already know
a bit about HTTP, but you might not yet

5
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:16,180
know what it's built out of.

6
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:18,870
This course gives you a basic
understanding of the workings of

7
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:20,070
internet protocols.

8
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:23,370
Focused on the protocols
that underlie HTTP.

9
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:26,390
To get the most out of this course,
you should already be familiar with HTTP

10
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:31,490
itself, and also with using the Linux
shell, SSH and command line programs.

11
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:33,930
If you need a bit of
a refresher on those,

12
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:37,230
take a look back at the Audacity
courses in Linux Command Line Basics,

13
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:40,399
Configuring Linux Web Servers,
and Designing RESTful API's.

14
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:44,700
To do this course,
you'll need to log in to a Linux system.

15
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,350
If you're taking this course as part
of a Udacity nanodegree program,

16
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:51,100
you can use the development
instance that we've set up for you.

17
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:54,950
In case you lost track of it, there's
a link to it in the instruction notes.

18
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:56,990
Otherwise, you can use
a real Linux server, or

19
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:59,860
you can set up a virtual machine
that runs on your regular computer.

20
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:01,580
See the instructor notes for
a link on how to do that.

21
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:05,980
Next up, I'm going to give you some
written instructions on how to install

22
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:08,200
the tools you'll need for
this course on your Linux system.
