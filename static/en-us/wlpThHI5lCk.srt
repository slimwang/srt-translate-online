Okay.

2
00:00:00,332 --> 00:00:04,238
Lets put everything you know about exponents together and answer this question.

3
00:00:04,329 --> 00:00:08,169
A cell divides into 4 cells after 2 hours. If each new cell also divides into 4

4
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:12,129
cells after 2 hours, how many cell are there after one day? You're going to need

5
00:00:12,141 --> 00:00:16,122
to think about time and how many rounds of division you'll have. Remember you're

6
00:00:16,134 --> 00:00:19,679
going to start with one cell, and then it's going to split into 4 cells. So

7
00:00:19,691 --> 00:00:23,560
after one round you'll have 4 cells, then each of these cells is going to split

8
00:00:23,572 --> 00:00:26,315
into 4 cells. You can put your answer into this box here.
