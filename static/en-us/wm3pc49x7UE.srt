00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:08,250
>> That's a good story David. Now let's consider a different set of issues.

2
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:12,770
Imagine that I told you a story. Bob went to a restaurant and sat down. But

3
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:17,265
nobody came to serve him for quite awhile. Eventually, when someone did appear,

4
00:01:17,265 --> 00:01:21,130
he ordered a hamburger. The hamburger took a long time before it came.

5
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:25,160
And when it did come, it was burned. Bob was not very happy.

6
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:29,710
He didn't even finish the hamburger. Do you think Bob left a large tip?

7
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:33,200
Well, I expect most of you would say no. He did not leave a large tip.

8
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,040
If we had to wait for a long time. And if the food that came eve,

9
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:41,320
eventually, was not of very high quality. You'd probably not even ask tip. But

10
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,415
how did you come to that answer? Why did you expect,

11
00:01:43,415 --> 00:01:46,204
that in this particular case, Bob will not leave a large tip? Again,

12
00:01:46,204 --> 00:01:50,158
this connects to your notion of a story. It connects to your notion of a story,

13
00:01:50,158 --> 00:01:54,210
of what happens in a restaurant. Why do people leave tips? When do they

14
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:58,970
leave them? To put it another way, stories help you make sense of the world.

15
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:04,180
They help you [INAUDIBLE] expectations, even before [UNKNOWN]. They allow

16
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:08,520
us to make connections between evens that otherwise might appear disparate. So

17
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:12,105
in this lesson, we'll look at another structured knowledge representation called

18
00:02:12,105 --> 00:02:16,660
scripts. For representing stories or the kind that we are talking about.

19
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:19,820
And we will see how this knowledge for presentation allows us to make sense of

20
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:22,590
the world. And answer the kinds of questions that we are talking about.
