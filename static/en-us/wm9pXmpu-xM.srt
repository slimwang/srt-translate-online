1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,210
Now our boss wants us to
know which customer segment

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:06,140
makes up the most of
our Denver customers.

3
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:11,270
We can do this easily by summarizing our
data on the Customer Segment field and

4
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:14,050
counting up the records in each segment.

5
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:19,306
To do this, we'll use the Summarize tool
and drop it next to the Filter tool.

6
00:00:19,306 --> 00:00:25,082
Then we'll click on the Customer Segment
field &gt; Add &gt; Group Buy.

7
00:00:25,082 --> 00:00:27,180
Now, the data will be
grouped by segment.

8
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:30,400
Next, to count up the records,

9
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:35,568
we'll go back to Add, select Count,
then, we'll run the work flow again.

10
00:00:35,568 --> 00:00:38,380
The results shows us
four customer segment

11
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:41,800
types with the number of
customers in each segment.

12
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:44,900
While it's pretty easy to see
the segment that contains the most

13
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:48,510
customers, imagine this list
had 10,000 records in it.

14
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,870
The way to find the top
segment by counts of customers

15
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:54,060
would be to sort the data.

16
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:59,330
To do that, let's grab the Sort tool
next, attach it to the Summarize tool.

17
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:03,920
Then we'll select the Count
field under name, and

18
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,350
set the order to be descending.

19
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:09,850
When we run the workflow again,
we can see that the customer segment,

20
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:13,759
corporate, has the most customers
at has the most customers at 390.
