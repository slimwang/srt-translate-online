1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,160
So, to get our outputs
in the correct range,

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:05,520
we're going to use the Modulus Operator.

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,304
And, this is written
with a percent sign.

4
00:00:08,304 --> 00:00:11,130
It's usually the Shift>5
on those keyboards.

5
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:13,850
What Modulus does is takes a number and

6
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:18,950
maps it to the range, based on the
remainder when you divide that number.

7
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:23,557
So, the way modulo arithmetic
works is like a clock.

8
00:00:23,557 --> 00:00:27,306
So, if we think of having
a clock with 12 hours and

9
00:00:27,306 --> 00:00:30,632
then arithmetic on
the clock is modulo 12.

10
00:00:30,632 --> 00:00:34,831
So, if we were to evaluate 14 modulo 12,

11
00:00:34,831 --> 00:00:39,360
what that would mean is if
we start from zero, and

12
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:44,332
we make 14 steps, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,

13
00:00:44,332 --> 00:00:48,536
8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.

14
00:00:48,536 --> 00:00:50,267
Where we end up is 2.

15
00:00:50,267 --> 00:00:55,154
That's the same as the remainder
we would get by dividing 14 by 12.

16
00:00:55,154 --> 00:00:58,964
And, that's the result of 14 modulo 12,
is 2.
