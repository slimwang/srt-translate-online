1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,460
Okay, so, now I know this is kind of a subjective

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:06,040
quiz, but here are the answers I was looking for. Storing login

3
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:09,760
information. This is something, you know, I just mentioned previously. That's a

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,280
really common use of cookies. So when you log into a website,

5
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:14,530
the web server gives you a cookie, and that identifies you for

6
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:19,320
future requests. Storing small amounts of data to avoid hitting a database.

7
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,570
Yes, this is another kind of handy little thing. You know, if

8
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:25,270
you've just got a small piece of data that you want to store.

9
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:28,600
You know it, it's, it's temporary. It's small. You don't need to

10
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:31,620
have all the infrastructure of a database to store it. And have

11
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:33,520
to you know hit your database on every request to retrieve it.

12
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,700
That sort of thing. Especially if it's, it's, if it's you know,

13
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:40,120
anonymous data. You know, data you don't mind losing. Because a user

14
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:43,440
can of course clear all the cookies out of their browser or

15
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,630
you know, a browser may not have cookies enabled at all. Storing

16
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:50,220
user preference info. no, this is not a good use of cookies.

17
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:53,780
At least in the notion of a user as we've

18
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:56,770
been kind of talking about where, you know, you might log

19
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:59,360
into a website and you have these preferences. This is

20
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,960
because you want the data to survive. Now, cookies can be

21
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:04,959
erased at any time. A user can change browsers, they

22
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:08,164
can go to a different machine, and the cookies don't, you

23
00:01:08,164 --> 00:01:11,460
know the cookies are specific to one browser. And as long

24
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:15,250
as the user allows them to be there. So data like

25
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:17,520
user preferences that you want to exist until a

26
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,770
user changes them on your website Shouldn't be stored in

27
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:22,860
cookies and tracking you for ads. This is unfortunately maybe

28
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:27,510
not a a good use more of an appropriate use

29
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:29,530
because tracking you for ads isn't really inherently a

30
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:35,150
good thing, but its a really common use of cookies.

31
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:38,060
You go to a website, you may find yourself with

32
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:40,670
20 cookies that are tracking you for different ad providers.

33
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:45,490
And in fact, I had a friend that worked for an ad tracking company for a while

34
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:48,758
and these transfers are kind of related. They used

35
00:01:48,758 --> 00:01:51,790
to joke that they had the world's largest database

36
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:55,570
stored in users' browsers all across the internet.

37
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:59,150
They had like, many hundreds and thousands of, of

38
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:03,620
terabytes of data. In theory stored you know, a

39
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:05,870
few hundred bytes at a time, in users' cookies.

40
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:08,970
Because they powered a lot of really big ad networks.

41
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:10,860
Cookies, and we'll come back to a little bit how ad

42
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:14,860
networks work. I think it's, it's interesting to understand. That cookies

43
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:18,040
are a critical technology for tracking you for for advertising purposes.
