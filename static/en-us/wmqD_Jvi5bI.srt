00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,450
Today we're going to focus on finding parametric models.

2
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:08,100
And what we mean by a parametric model is that it's a, it's a class.

3
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:12,220
It's a class, it's a model that represents a set of instances where each

4
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:15,890
instance can be represented by a particular setting of the parameter or

5
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:16,960
the parameters.

6
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,480
So for example, a line is a parametric model.

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,450
A circle is a parametric model.

8
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:25,530
And, like I said, we'll even be able to talk about a parameterized template,

9
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:26,980
where you have a template but

10
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:30,330
you change it's shape according to the value of some parameters.

11
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:35,320
So, when you're trying to fit a parametric model, or another way of saying is

12
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:37,860
you're trying to find a parametric model inside your image.

13
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:39,220
They're essentially a cup,

14
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:41,550
there are a couple of things you have to keep in mind.

15
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:45,170
The first is, what parametric model are you going to use?

16
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:47,210
That is, you know, how are you going to represent,

17
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:49,910
how do you go from the parameters to the thing you're representing.

18
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:52,120
And in fact, today, we're going to show you that even for

19
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:56,140
something as simple as a line, how do your parameterization matters.

20
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:57,270
The other thing about this model, and

21
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:01,330
this actually works to our advantage, is that the membership, or

22
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:03,870
the notion that a little point in the image or an edge or

23
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:08,820
a template belongs to a model, is not determined by just looking at that edge.

24
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:12,570
You actually have to look at many different edges or look at the whole model.

25
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:15,420
And that notion of extended support is something we're going to

26
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:16,890
take advantage of.

27
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:20,680
And then finally whenever you go looking for parametric model.

28
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:25,270
You could just say well, if computers were infinitely fast, and

29
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:28,670
every time we use one they feel like they're becoming infinitely fast.

30
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:32,690
Well I would just check for every possible line in all possible places.

31
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:37,090
Well, the reality is that even with really, really, really, fast computers.

32
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:42,830
The number of possible models is really, really, really big.

33
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:45,596
So it turns out you're really, really, really, I'm losing track here.

34
00:01:45,596 --> 00:01:47,050
Turns out you're a really fast computer,

35
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:50,600
still, you have to worry about the combinatorics of your computation
