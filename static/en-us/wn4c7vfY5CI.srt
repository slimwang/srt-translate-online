00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,242
The answer is is that this displacement happens at the vertex shader. This

2
00:00:03,242 --> 00:00:07,270
shader has control of what happens to each incoming vertex. The vertex shader

3
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:10,609
reads the displacement map texture at the vertices' location and uses it to

4
00:00:10,609 --> 00:00:15,005
displace the vertex. The other parts of the pipeline take these displaced

5
00:00:15,005 --> 00:00:19,696
triangles and process fragments created by them. Each fragment has a pixel

6
00:00:19,696 --> 00:00:23,530
location and cannot change to another pixel location. The fragment shader can

7
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:26,995
apply the normal map, but this operation does not change the location of the

8
00:00:26,995 --> 00:00:28,430
vertex.
