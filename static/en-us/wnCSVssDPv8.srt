00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:01,090
Before we get started,

2
00:00:01,090 --> 00:00:04,360
let's talk about how to evaluate whether
or not you're ready to take this class.

3
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:07,710
To take this class, you should answer
yes to all of the following questions.

4
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:09,400
First, have you already
fulfilled your foundational

5
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:10,860
requirement for the program?

6
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:13,500
That's going to give you experience
receiving educational technology, which

7
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,550
should really be all the preparation you
need for the content of this course.

8
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:18,510
Second, are you
comfortable with writing?

9
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:21,870
This course is going to involve several
short and a couple long essays, so

10
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:24,690
to succeed you need to be
comfortable writing essays.

11
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:27,550
Third, are you comfortable with a course
that's going to evaluate participation

12
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:29,720
as a first class object in the grading?

13
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:31,410
Because this course is built
on the discussions and

14
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:34,190
conversations, we're going to
explicitly evaluate whether or

15
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:36,370
not you participated in the course.

16
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:38,305
Fourth, are you comfortable
with taking on a big,

17
00:00:38,305 --> 00:00:41,230
open-ended group project as part
of your work for this class?

18
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:42,080
Or alternatively,

19
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:45,250
are you comfortable with taking
on a big project all on your own?

20
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:47,620
Because the goal of this class is to
produce something that's had an actual

21
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:50,090
contribution to the educational
technology community,

22
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:51,660
the scope of the project
will be very large.

23
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:54,522
So you need to be comfortable with
that kind of project for this course.

24
00:00:54,522 --> 00:00:57,959
Fifth, are you passionate about
education and educational technology?

25
00:00:57,959 --> 00:00:59,144
Do you already have some ideas for

26
00:00:59,144 --> 00:01:01,697
the kinds of tools you might want to
build or research you want to conduct?

27
00:01:01,697 --> 00:01:03,654
Because this class is built
around the project, and

28
00:01:03,654 --> 00:01:05,302
because you'll specify your own project,

29
00:01:05,302 --> 00:01:08,700
it's really important that you be
invested in what you're working on.

30
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:11,398
And lastly, are you comfortable with a
class that's really built on these big,

31
00:01:11,398 --> 00:01:13,490
open-ended, student-driven projects?

32
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:15,940
In this class, you're going to propose
your own project, execute it and

33
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:17,760
deliver it at the end of the semester.

34
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,580
The requirements will be very fuzzy,
the grading will be very informal,

35
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:23,270
and there's not really a schedule
of what you need to do or watch or

36
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:24,540
read and when.

37
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:27,590
And that kind of structure can be
very frustrating for some students.

38
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:30,790
Now before we move on, let's also talk
about the things that aren't required.

39
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:33,050
You'll notice that I didn't ask any
questions about programming ability.

40
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:36,270
And in fact, you can take this class and
you can complete this class without

41
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:40,152
writing a single line of code by doing
research or user testing or design.

42
00:01:40,152 --> 00:01:42,290
And note that I also didn't ask
if you have experience with

43
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:43,830
educational technology.

44
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:46,380
This class is built so
that the only real experience you need

45
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:48,290
is the experience you've already
gotten in the LMS program.

46
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:50,880
So you don't really need either
of those things to succeed, but

47
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,790
you do need to answer yes
to the previous questions.
