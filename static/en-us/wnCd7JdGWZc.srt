1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:03,180
There are two broad categories
of approaches to use for

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:05,650
choosing stocks to buy or sell.

3
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:09,790
They're based on Fundamental
analysis and Technical analysis.

4
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:12,380
Fundamental analysis involves looking at

5
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:16,000
aspects of a company in
order to estimate its value.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,750
Fundamental investors typically look for

7
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:23,260
situations where the price of
a company is below its value.

8
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:25,950
Another camp is based
on Technical analysis.

9
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:29,060
Technicians don't care about
the value of a company.

10
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:33,120
Instead, they look for patterns or
trends in a stock's price.

11
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,650
This lesson will focus
on technical analysis.
