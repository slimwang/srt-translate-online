1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,401
So, this is pretty cool. We can make a web application. We can respond to

2
00:00:03,401 --> 00:00:07,480
different kinds of requests. We can embed it with our search engine. There's one

3
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:11,572
pretty big problem with it still and that's that every time we start the server,

4
00:00:11,572 --> 00:00:15,440
we have to do this full web crawl. Since we're using our toy test site, we're

5
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,098
sort of okay with this because it doesn't take long and we expect that site to

6
00:00:19,098 --> 00:00:23,854
be up most of the time. But if we were trying to build a real search engine and

7
00:00:23,854 --> 00:00:27,575
want it to crawl a large chunk of the web, well, we need to crawl billions of

8
00:00:27,575 --> 00:00:31,308
pages. This takes a long time. So, we can't do that every time we need to start

9
00:00:31,308 --> 00:00:35,002
the server. We might need to restart the server frequently. Maybe the server

10
00:00:35,002 --> 00:00:39,050
crashes, hopefully it doesn't if we built things correctly. But we might need to

11
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:42,250
start it on lots of machines, we might need to restart it when things change.

12
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:46,158
So, we don't want to have to re-crawl the web every time. We're in a bit of a

13
00:00:46,158 --> 00:00:50,845
pickle. We need a way of storing the results with a crawl in a file and loading

14
00:00:50,845 --> 00:00:54,955
it so we don't have to do the crawl every time. And if it's a really big crawl,

15
00:00:54,955 --> 00:00:58,739
talking about billions of pages, well, a regular file isn't going to be enough.

16
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:02,018
We're going to assume it's small enough that we can use regular file for that.

17
00:01:02,018 --> 00:01:04,873
We're not going to get into how you might want to manage this if you have a

18
00:01:04,873 --> 00:01:08,589
really, really large amount of data here. So, what we need to do is learn how to

19
00:01:08,589 --> 00:01:12,684
perform the crawl instead of needing to crawl the web every time we start the

20
00:01:12,684 --> 00:01:16,504
server. Instead, we want to load an existing web corpus. So, to do that we're

21
00:01:16,504 --> 00:01:19,580
going to need you learn about how to read and write from files. That's what

22
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:20,053
we'll do next.
