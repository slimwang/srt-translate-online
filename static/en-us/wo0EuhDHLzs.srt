1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,036
There are two correct answers.

2
00:00:02,036 --> 00:00:04,998
100 of those players
leave after 24 hours, and

3
00:00:04,998 --> 00:00:07,430
40 of those players stay after one week.

4
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:10,339
First, let's review the 40-20-10 rule.

5
00:00:10,339 --> 00:00:16,244
We measure good retention to be at
least 40% after the first 24 hours,

6
00:00:16,244 --> 00:00:20,005
20% after a week, and 10% after a month.

7
00:00:20,005 --> 00:00:26,158
For this first answer, if 100 out
of 200 players leave after a day,

8
00:00:26,158 --> 00:00:31,335
you still have retained 50% of
your players after day one.

9
00:00:31,335 --> 00:00:36,010
And this is higher than
the 40% in our 40-20-10 rule.

10
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:40,744
But for this answer, if only 70 of
our players stay after one day,

11
00:00:40,744 --> 00:00:46,580
this is only 35% retention, and that's
too low for our first day measurement.

12
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:52,074
If 40 out of 200 stay after a week,
that's the same as 20 out of 100,

13
00:00:52,074 --> 00:00:56,090
or 20% retention,
which matches our rule for a week.

14
00:00:56,090 --> 00:01:00,280
In this last answer, we have 100
new players joining later on.

15
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:04,421
And this gives us no information about
the retention of the 200 players

16
00:01:04,421 --> 00:01:06,440
we were originally interested in.
