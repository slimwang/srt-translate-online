1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,296
So imagine in your shop that you have a design method, and

2
00:00:03,296 --> 00:00:07,975
you've, you've chosen a design representation, and you've done a design.

3
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:11,353
The result is some artifact expressed in the design notation.

4
00:00:11,353 --> 00:00:16,567
Now typically, these days, that representation is reviewed by a team, that is,

5
00:00:16,567 --> 00:00:22,360
there's some validation the design in fact meets it, the system's requirements.

6
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:25,130
The question for this particular quiz is,

7
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:28,820
why bother with the validation now if you're going to build the program and

8
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:32,170
have tests, many of which may be automated, to check it for you?
