00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
In this homework assignment, we have a puzzle, which is similar to the zebra puzzle.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I'm calling it the floor puzzle.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
We describe a five-floor apartment building in which there are five residents,

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
and there's various constraints on them.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:22,000
What I want you to do is just write the code to return the proper floor assignment

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
for each of the five inhabitants in that order.
