00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:04,156
Another behavioral technique that involves exposing a person to the feared

2
00:00:04,156 --> 00:00:09,085
stimulus is flooding. Flooding is based on the response prevention principle.

3
00:00:09,085 --> 00:00:13,629
Flooding involves prolonged exposure to the feared stimulus, which in turn

4
00:00:13,629 --> 00:00:19,440
provides maximum opportunity for the fear to be extinguished. Now, unlike

5
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:23,472
systematic desensitization, which slowly exposes a person to a stimulus,

6
00:00:23,472 --> 00:00:29,142
flooding does it all at once. Now, at times, flooding can actually make a

7
00:00:29,142 --> 00:00:33,623
phobia worse and it has to be used carefully. For example, with people with

8
00:00:33,623 --> 00:00:38,159
medical conditions. And you can't use it with all types of phobias. For

9
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:39,340
example, house fires.
