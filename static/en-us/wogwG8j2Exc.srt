I want to describe a typical situation that often arises during

3
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:09,180
industrial software development.

00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:12,810
The decision has to do with acquiring software assets.

5
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:14,500
Should you construct them yourself?

6
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,160
Or buy them from somewhere else?

7
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,170
This is sometimes called the buy versus build decision.
