1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Last time we finished up breaking up HTML and JavaScript into tokens.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
We'd specified them by regular expressions,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
which are implemented by finite state machines.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
And this has always been one of my favorite parts of programming languages,

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
and it actually sticks in my mind when I was a student

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
taking this in a more traditional classroom,

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
the instructor asked after talking about regular expressions in lexing

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
"Is there anyone interested in doing research?"

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
And this was actually my first step towards becoming a professor,

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
but actually, I was doing really poorly in the class at the time.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I was not a very good student,

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
so I went to the professor's office.

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
He said, "Show up if you want to do undergraduate research."

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I was there, and when I came in the door, there was a second

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
where I could see in his eyes this "You? Not you."

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
But then he quickly sort of changed to a more positive attitude,

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
and I continued to work with him, and that began my career

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
pushing forth the boundaries of human knowledge

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
by studying programming languages.

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
And to some degree, what I want you to take away from a story like this

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
is it's not necessary to have mastered these concepts

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
right at the beginning or the first time you see them.

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
What I really want is for you to master these concepts by the end of the course,

24
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
so don't feel too bad if the original units have been giving you a bit of difficulty.

25
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
They gave me a lot of difficulty when I learned them the first time.

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
We finished up with regular expressions, and this time we're going to move on to

27
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
context-free grammars, the sentences of programming languages.

28
00:01:25,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Let's get started.
