1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:04,600
>> I'm here at the Autodesk Gallery in San Francisco with Sam Black. So, Sam,

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:06,750
well, first of all, tell us about your background.

3
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:09,922
>> Well, I have bachelors' degrees in electrical engineering and computer

4
00:00:09,922 --> 00:00:13,302
engineering from University of Michigan, and a master's in computer science

5
00:00:13,302 --> 00:00:17,974
from University of North Carolina. I've worked in various parts of the graphics

6
00:00:17,974 --> 00:00:21,569
industry. I started out in workstation graphics, working on the first

7
00:00:21,569 --> 00:00:25,624
commercially available X server. Then I went to work in the games industry for

8
00:00:25,624 --> 00:00:29,512
a little while. Came out to California, worked for Pixar for eight years, and

9
00:00:29,512 --> 00:00:31,240
then came to AutoDesk.

10
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:34,791
>> So you've really gone through what I consider sort of three pillars of the the

11
00:00:34,791 --> 00:00:40,497
graphics industry, which is film, games, and and computer-aided design. tell me

12
00:00:40,497 --> 00:00:44,350
a little bit about like, well, you know, what are the pluses and minuses of

13
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:45,392
each?

14
00:00:45,392 --> 00:00:48,857
>> Well, they're all, a lot of, they have a lot of similarities amongst them and

15
00:00:48,857 --> 00:00:52,157
so, it's really the sort of the end product that you're looking at that's

16
00:00:52,157 --> 00:00:57,280
different. And everyone thinks it's the games are, or how much fun to work on

17
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,520
but in a way they're almost the hardest because they tend to have the most

18
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:05,819
compressed schedules. Although the film industry has tight schedules, but the

19
00:01:05,819 --> 00:01:10,244
project that I was working on tended to be a little more open-ended. I was

20
00:01:10,244 --> 00:01:13,610
working on the RenderMan product and some advanced rendering techniques, so I

21
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:17,930
wasn't tied directly to a film, to a release. So, I didn't feel all the

22
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:19,115
pressure that.

23
00:01:19,115 --> 00:01:19,470
>> No.

24
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:23,339
>> You normally feel in those things. And then coming here to, to AutoDesk,

25
00:01:23,339 --> 00:01:27,233
working on AutoCad, again very similar, si-, working in the graphics field and

26
00:01:27,233 --> 00:01:31,900
it's just a lot of, you know, getting the, the right visuals out there with the

27
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:34,362
right performance.
