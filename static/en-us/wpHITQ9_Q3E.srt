00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,910
If you took website
performance optimization,

2
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:06,430
then this website may
look a little familiar.

3
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:08,039
Inside the project for the course,

4
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:10,402
there's this pizza site
that has a lot of problems.

5
00:00:10,402 --> 00:00:14,325
And I think it's fair to say that one of
the problems with this website is that

6
00:00:14,325 --> 00:00:18,327
it will probably burn your eyes out, if
you spend too much time looking at it.

7
00:00:18,327 --> 00:00:22,005
When you scroll down to this our pizza
section on the left side of the screen,

8
00:00:22,005 --> 00:00:23,453
you'll notice this slider.

9
00:00:23,453 --> 00:00:26,410
When you toggle the sliders,
the pizzas change size.

10
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:29,249
Now it doesn't look so
bad when you toggle back and

11
00:00:29,249 --> 00:00:33,862
forth between the different sizes, but I
want to take a look at its performance.

12
00:00:33,862 --> 00:00:36,568
You'll notice two things when
you open up the council.

13
00:00:36,568 --> 00:00:39,702
The first is the average time
to generate the last ten frames,

14
00:00:39,702 --> 00:00:43,272
which in this case is way too low for
a site that's a simple as this one.

15
00:00:43,272 --> 00:00:47,661
The second thing you'll notice is
the amount of time it took to resize

16
00:00:47,661 --> 00:00:48,504
the pizzas.

17
00:00:48,504 --> 00:00:52,118
This number will be logged out anytime
somebody clicks on the slider over here.

18
00:00:52,118 --> 00:00:55,495
Right now, it's displaying times
at around 100 milliseconds.

19
00:00:55,495 --> 00:00:59,593
A good question to ask is is 100
milliseconds reasonable for this?

20
00:00:59,593 --> 00:01:04,319
In fact, this resize time falls under
the response category of rails.

21
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:07,430
And that's because this is happening
as a response to a user action,

22
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:10,270
which includes clicking on the slider.

23
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:14,300
Resizing the pizzas probably falls
under the response category of rail,

24
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:17,020
which as you remember
is 100 milliseconds.

25
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:19,978
In that case, this app is actually
meeting the budget for response.

26
00:01:19,978 --> 00:01:22,598
However, just given how
simple this site is.

27
00:01:22,598 --> 00:01:27,088
There is no reason the resize pizza
action should be taking 100 milliseconds

28
00:01:27,088 --> 00:01:30,172
where this happening in the Animation or
idle phases,

29
00:01:30,172 --> 00:01:32,934
this would totally be
blowing the frame budget.

30
00:01:32,934 --> 00:01:35,835
A recorded timeline to see if I can
find out a little bit more about

31
00:01:35,835 --> 00:01:37,518
what's happening with the slider.

32
00:01:37,518 --> 00:01:39,160
I will hit Record.

33
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:42,438
I will slide the pizzas and
I will stop recording.

34
00:01:42,438 --> 00:01:45,252
This purple is a really bad sign.

35
00:01:45,252 --> 00:01:49,250
Let me expand this into its own
window to take a closer look.

36
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:51,470
It looks like the slider
is calling a function and

37
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:55,340
then the function is causing a ton
of layouts one after another.

38
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:57,360
That is a major issue.

39
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,200
I'll click on one to get
a little bit more information and

40
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,530
in the details pane,
I see that there's a warning that says,

41
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:06,100
forced synchronous layout is
a possible performance bottleneck.

42
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:08,830
That is a problem.

43
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:12,720
So for this quiz, it's going to be
your job to download the pizza site,

44
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:17,420
find the cause of the sliders for
synchronous layout and then fix it.

45
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:20,280
Check this box to let us know
that the slider is no longer

46
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,340
creating a forced synchronous layout.
