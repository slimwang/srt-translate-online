1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,290
To illustrate the use of binding and

2
00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:08,020
registries by applications when they
use RPCs, we will draw an analogy

3
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:12,554
with how toy shops rely on
directories of outsourcing services.

4
00:00:12,554 --> 00:00:16,079
For instance, in a toy shop
when considering whether or

5
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:20,680
not to use some kind of outsourcing
service, the manager will want to know

6
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:24,590
who out there can provide
that particular service.

7
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:30,220
What are the specifics service details
that those outsourcing companies offer?

8
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:34,350
And exactly, what are the shipping or
packaging options they provide.

9
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:37,300
For instance, the toy shop
manager may consider looking at

10
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:40,450
the directories service to
find out what are the shops

11
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:44,270
where outsourcing of assembly
operations can be supported.

12
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:48,440
He will look up what
are the exact services that

13
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:50,190
each of these shops provide.

14
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:53,260
And for instance he's trying
to find the service where

15
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:56,350
the assembly of train
cars can be provided.

16
00:00:56,350 --> 00:01:00,550
And then the manager may be interested
in exactly what are the shipping options

17
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:01,210
that they offer.

18
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:04,200
For instance,
whether they ship with UPS.

19
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:08,760
To give an analogous example in
the context of operating systems and

20
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:12,800
the applications use of binding and
registries in RPC.

21
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:17,370
Now we can see that the same types of
steps are required to be performed by

22
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:22,290
applications when they rely on
the RPC to execute some service.

23
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:25,570
For instance, they have to look
up the registry to find out

24
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:27,590
who can provide a particular service.

25
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:31,120
They can look up a registry with
a service name that requires specify

26
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,210
somehow some image processing.

27
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:37,580
The registry provides some detail
regarding the various services that

28
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:40,930
are provided by each server,
the version number.

29
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:45,360
All of this relays on the use of some
interface definition language so

30
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,406
that the interface can be
describe in some standard way.

31
00:01:49,406 --> 00:01:53,390
And then finally, also the registry
will provide information regarding

32
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:58,590
the protocols that a particular server
or services support like TCP or UDP.

33
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:02,030
The applications can take all of
this information into consideration

34
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:05,150
when determining which
particular process to bind with,

35
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:06,850
which particular server to bind with.

36
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:11,700
And similarly in the toy shop, the toy
shop manager can consider the answers to

37
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,850
all of these questions when determining
how to outsource a service.
