00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:05,588
Why sentinel value? Well, a sentinel is like the fellow you see over here who

2
00:00:05,588 --> 00:00:11,400
guards something. In our case the sentinel is that last input that guards the

3
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:16,539
input sequence. It just says this is the end of the input sequence. Do we have

4
00:00:16,539 --> 00:00:20,800
to use zero as a sentinel? No, there are other possibilities. For example,

5
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:26,154
minus 1 would work if all inputs must be greater or equal 0. Or if any numbers

6
00:00:26,154 --> 00:00:31,683
can be inputs, you could use the letter Q. In the exercises that come, you'll

7
00:00:31,683 --> 00:00:34,974
explore some of these possibilities.
