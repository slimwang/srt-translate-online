00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,850
A number of other useful helper methods are available there too.

2
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:06,580
And it's a good idea to look up the documentation about each of them.

3
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:09,070
One of the most useful properties is .constructor,

4
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:13,010
which makes it easy to tell what function was used to create a certain object.

5
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:14,095
Like all properties,

6
00:00:14,095 --> 00:00:18,680
.constructor actually points to a different object that's stored elsewhere.

7
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:21,470
People frequently confuse the object prototype with this

8
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:24,200
constructor function used to make all objects.

9
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:26,720
So let's visualize the two in different boxes for

10
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,570
a moment as a reminder of the way it's really laid out inside your computer.

11
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:34,310
Whenever you ask an object about its .constructor property,

12
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:38,600
the object most likely doesn't have a local .constructor property, so

13
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,262
the prototype chain gets consulted.

14
00:00:40,262 --> 00:00:44,820
The .constructor property on the object prototype points to the constructor

15
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:49,150
function for making object and so that object is provided as the result.
