Welcome to lesson five. In lesson five we're going to

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:05,330
talk about how to make your website communicate with, not just

3
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:08,290
with humans but also with other computers by building what

4
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:12,230
we call an API or Application Programming Interface, which is really

5
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:15,700
just a fancy way of saying instead of generating HTML

6
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:18,820
that we send to browsers that ultimately just get read by

7
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:22,990
humans, we're going to send data in formats XML or JSON

8
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:25,410
which are similar to html, but are designed to be read

9
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:28,390
by computers instead. In this lesson we're going to add a

10
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:31,160
feature to ASCIIChan, that will actually allow you to see where

11
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:35,690
users are submitting images from, using the Google maps API.

12
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:39,130
And in the homework for this lesson, we're going to be adding

13
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:41,550
the JSON output to your own blog. So if somebody

14
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:44,530
wanted to build a service that used some data from your

15
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:47,040
blog that you thought was important, they can actually write a

16
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:50,330
program to fetch your blog, manipulate the data however they like,

17
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:53,070
and then build their own web service on top of that, which is actually

18
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:56,120
how a lot of the internet works. So, let's go ahead and jump right in.
