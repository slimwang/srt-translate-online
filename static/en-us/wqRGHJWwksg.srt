1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:02,855
So the answer is, we want to select the part

2
00:00:02,855 --> 00:00:04,870
of the word that we can still use in our

3
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:08,039
solution. So we can't keep the a, and we can't

4
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:11,280
keep the lower case u, so those are positions 0

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,427
and 1. From position 2 to the end is good,

6
00:00:14,427 --> 00:00:18,640
so we can produce that using the index selection. We're

7
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,910
going to select from s, starting from position 2. If we

8
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:25,860
wanted, we could count all the letters and select from

9
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:29,770
s to the final position. We can also just use

10
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:31,975
a closed bracket. We don't need to count the letters that's

11
00:00:31,975 --> 00:00:34,460
going to select from position 2 to the end of the string.

12
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:38,170
Now, we want to get the uppercase U in front. So,

13
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:41,330
we're going to have an uppercase U added to that. And

14
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:45,940
finally, we need the print to print that out. So, here

15
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:48,500
that is in the Python interpreter. We have the definition of

16
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,860
s that was provided. And what we're going to do is print

17
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:54,225
out capital U plus S, two colon to the

18
00:00:54,225 --> 00:00:57,750
end. And as expected, we get our result: Udacity.
