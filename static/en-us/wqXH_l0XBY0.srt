00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,690
Linux is by far the most popular
operating system of choice for

2
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:05,740
web servers on the Internet today.

3
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:08,630
Some estimates say 80% of
public Internet servers

4
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:10,780
are running some flavor of Linux.

5
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:13,050
So what exactly is Linux?

6
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:16,050
Linux is an operating system
similar to Microsoft Windows or

7
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:18,940
Apple OS X,
which you might be more familiar with.

8
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:21,890
The biggest difference with
Linux though is it's free.

9
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:25,120
Now, when I say free,
you may be thinking of money, and

10
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:27,150
that's not necessarily the case.

11
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:31,140
You may have heard the phrases,
free as in beer and free as in speech.

12
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:34,080
It's quite popular within
the open source community.

13
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:36,470
Let's discuss what
each of these means and

14
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:38,520
how they apply to
the Linux operating system.
