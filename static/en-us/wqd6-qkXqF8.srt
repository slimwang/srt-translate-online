1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,188
So, it is the range then if it is not all the real numbers. Well, we know that

2
00:00:04,188 --> 00:00:08,676
the minimum point the lowest value that's a member of the range is negative 2.25

3
00:00:08,676 --> 00:00:13,028
and because the graph actually passes through that point and includes it you

4
00:00:13,028 --> 00:00:17,490
need a square bracket. Following the graph in either direction though,we can

5
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:21,450
tell that the values of f of x are just going to continue to increase as the

6
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:26,106
values of x increase. And the same thing will happen in the other direction as

7
00:00:26,106 --> 00:00:30,639
well, as x values decrease, n of x values increase. This increasing is never

8
00:00:30,639 --> 00:00:34,769
going to stop, so the other n point of the range is infinity, with that open

9
00:00:34,769 --> 00:00:35,674
parenthesis.
