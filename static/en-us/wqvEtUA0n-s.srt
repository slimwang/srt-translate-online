1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,040
Without making any adjustments to this plot, I notice that

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:06,830
having more than 1,000 friends is quite rare. Even for very

3
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:08,900
young users we can see that this is where it

4
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:12,360
peaks, with the exception of this older crowd. And that the

5
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:15,340
90 percentile is well below 1,000. You may have also

6
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:18,325
zoomed in on this plot using the coord_cartesian layer. To use

7
00:00:18,325 --> 00:00:21,023
it, we need to get rid of the coord_trans and

8
00:00:21,023 --> 00:00:25,010
the xlim layers first. So I'll delete those lines of code.

9
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:27,580
Adding in the coord_cartesian layer, we can just set the x and

10
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:31,020
y limits to whatever we think is appropriate. For our users, I want to

11
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:35,020
explore users between the age of 13 and 70. And for friend counts,

12
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:37,920
the 90th percentile is a 1,000, so that seems like a good upper

13
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,640
limit here. Now it looks like I got an error and that's

14
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,760
because I forgot to add a plus sign after this layer. I want to

15
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,890
add all these layers on top of each other. Now with this plot,

16
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:50,220
we can see that we get a little bit more detail. For example,

17
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:52,680
we can see that for 35 year olds to

18
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:56,090
60 year olds, the friend count falls below 250.

19
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:59,760
So 90% of our users between this age group

20
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,890
have less than 250 friends. At least according to Facebook.
