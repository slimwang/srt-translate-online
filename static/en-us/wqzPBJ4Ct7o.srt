00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,757
You remember that the 5x needs to multiply the entire side of the equation, and

2
00:00:04,757 --> 00:00:09,479
of course, both sides. So you just do multiplication by 5x to both terms. This

3
00:00:09,479 --> 00:00:14,186
time we get 14 equals 35x, which is also something that we had earlier. I think

4
00:00:14,186 --> 00:00:19,016
that multiplying by the lowest common denominator of our two fractions initially

5
00:00:19,016 --> 00:00:22,889
helped us out a lot. Made this whole process much easier in fewer steps. So

6
00:00:22,889 --> 00:00:26,402
that's a good tip for moving forward in the future. If you want to get rid of

7
00:00:26,402 --> 00:00:29,936
your fractions right off the bat, then the factor that you should multiply

8
00:00:29,936 --> 00:00:33,641
everything by should be the least common denominator of all of your fractions

9
00:00:33,641 --> 00:00:34,824
that you want to combine.
