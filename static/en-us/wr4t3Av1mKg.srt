00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,560
Since we've now had a little bit of
practice with combining like terms, I want

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:07,574
to make sure that it's abundantly clear
which terms we're allowed to combine and

3
00:00:07,574 --> 00:00:11,192
which ones we're not. Terms that you're
trying to add together can be combined if

4
00:00:11,192 --> 00:00:16,291
and only if two things are true. So first
things first, the terms have to have

5
00:00:16,291 --> 00:00:22,749
exactly the same variable or variables. So
examples of this will be terms like 3xy

6
00:00:22,749 --> 00:00:31,199
and 7xy or -4b and 15b. On top of this I
have to add that each of these variables

7
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:36,251
that correspond to another have to have
the same powers or the same exponents. So,

8
00:00:36,263 --> 00:00:43,090
if we have the term 3x^2 and the term 6x,
and we try to add those together, we

9
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:47,963
cannot combine them. These are not like
terms, even though they have x's in them,

10
00:00:47,963 --> 00:00:53,190
this is 3x^2 and this is just 6x to the
first power. They don't have the same

11
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:57,396
power, so we can't squish them down into 1
term. Another example of this would be

12
00:00:57,396 --> 00:01:04,596
something like 11ab^3 + 12a^2b3.
Even if the b^3 factors have the same

13
00:01:04,596 --> 00:01:10,152
power, the a here only has a power of 1
and the a here has the power of 2.

14
00:01:10,152 --> 00:01:14,258
We cannot add these two things together
because one of the variables involved

15
00:01:14,258 --> 00:01:18,552
does not have the same power in both terms. So,
we cannot squish them down into one term.
