1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:01,569
Congratulations!

2
00:00:01,569 --> 00:00:03,310
You've reached the end of the course.

3
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:05,990
I hope you've had as much fun taking
this course as much as Paul and

4
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:06,850
I had making it.

5
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:07,460
>> For sure!

6
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:11,800
You've learned a load of tricks to get
your apps to run at 60 frames a second.

7
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:14,790
>> Share your stories about how you
made the app performant alongside your

8
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:17,410
fixes and successes in the forums,
on Twitter,

9
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:20,530
on Google+ or
whatever other social media you like.

10
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:22,250
Make sure, when you're
reading about other people's,

11
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:24,590
you apply the same approaches
to your own projects.

12
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:26,850
>> Yeah, profile sites in your apps,

13
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:30,710
figure out where your bottlenecks
are and stomp out that jank.

14
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:33,190
Basically, as always,
performance matters.
