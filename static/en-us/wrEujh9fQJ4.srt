00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,220
You've seen one example all the way through, and have equations for each step.

2
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:07,676
Implement the method getNumberOfFields which takes a width and a length of a

3
00:00:07,676 --> 00:00:12,740
piece of land and returns the number of fields that fit on that piece of land.

4
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:14,779
Use each of the steps that we walked through together.
