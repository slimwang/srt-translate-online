Hi, my name is Lorenzo.

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:05,620
I'll be your instructor in this
course as we explore the design and

3
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:07,120
implementation of web APIs.

4
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:11,460
Throughout this course, you'll work on
several mini projects that each focus on

5
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:12,850
a specific concept you'll learn.

6
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:14,990
At the end of this course,

7
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:18,330
you'll use all the skills learned to
create a final object called Meat and

8
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:22,680
Eat, a social application for meeting
people based on their food interests.

9
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:26,770
By building the back end of this
application you will gain some insight

10
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:30,440
into how these social applications
work underneath the hood.

11
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:34,000
In addition you will learn some tips
when it comes to designing API endpoints

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,580
for clientside consumption of your code.
