1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:01,850
I did want to mention at this point that

2
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:05,930
there are other viewpoint controls. There's an initial scale property

3
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:08,570
that lets you set what the browser's initial scaling factor

4
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:12,490
will be. It defaults to one and usually, you don't

5
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:14,740
really want to mess with it. If you change it to

6
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:18,250
another number, this changes the initial zoom factor. And the

7
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:22,270
user will probably have to pan or zoom. There is

8
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:26,080
one very critical use to initial scale though. On iOS,

9
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,350
if you only set width to device width and

10
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:31,670
you don't set the initial scale, like in this page,

11
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:34,610
when you rotate the screen the iOS web engine

12
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:38,080
will keep the same view port width and rescale it

13
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:41,330
to fit across the landscape screen. It's just stretching

14
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:44,810
the portrait layout, to fit, across the landscape width. Even

15
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:47,040
though I've set width to device width, IOS is

16
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:51,040
still scaling the landscape width. In fact, the interesting bit.

17
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53,690
is that even if you load this page initially

18
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:56,790
in landscape mode, it still thinks it's the portrait

19
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:58,920
width, it just rescaling it to fit in the

20
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:02,990
landscape screen. Now, if you have the same page,

21
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:05,370
but you set the initial scale to 1 in

22
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:09,070
the viewport meta-element along with setting device width, it'll

23
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:12,520
change the viewport size when you rotate, instead of

24
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:16,220
rescaling. You can see now the window size is 480

25
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:19,460
pixels across. It's the landscape width, not the

26
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:22,500
portrait width. So, in short, this is what

27
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,660
you really need to use as your default

28
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:28,850
boiler plate viewport meta-element. You'll need the initial scale,

29
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:31,090
so that IRS, when flipping from portrait to

30
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:36,110
landscape mode will still scale correctly. An interesting side

31
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:38,530
note I discovered is that on Iphones -

32
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:41,290
Although they are changing the viewport size properly if

33
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:43,630
an initial scale is that, they are also

34
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:46,780
changing the default font size for the document

35
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:50,250
and orientation change, effectively zooming up the text

36
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:52,820
when you go to landscape mode. This means

37
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:55,510
you should probably set a default font size

38
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:58,970
on the page, not just use an percentages.

39
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:02,570
You may want to use a reset style sheet to do this, if you aren't already.
