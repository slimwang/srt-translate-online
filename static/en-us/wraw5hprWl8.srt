1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,270
To edit the activity, there are a number
of steps you need to follow.

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:03,850
First of all,

3
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:08,185
the activity itself should implement
OnStreetViewPanoramaReadyCallback.

4
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:12,140
Once you've done that in
your OnCreate method,

5
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:15,600
you have to create
a StreetViewPanoramaFragment Object and

6
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:18,920
hook it up to the one you put
in the layout of the XML file.

7
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:20,190
Once you have this object,

8
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:25,630
call this method
getStreetViewPanoramaAsync(this) on it.

9
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:28,630
Next you have to create an override and
it's the override for

10
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:30,740
onStreetViewPanoramaReady.

11
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:34,670
And this is because you've implemented
the OnStreetViewPanoramaReadyCallback.

12
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:38,280
The onStreetView PanoramaReady
override takes a single parameter.

13
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:42,240
And this is the streetViewPanorama,
and you just give that an object.

14
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,420
For example,
you could just call it Panorama.

15
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:48,760
Then on this object, you call
.setPosition() for the location.

16
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:51,160
If you want to set it to
the Grand Canyon as I have done,

17
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:54,080
this is the latitude and
longitude of the Grand Canyon.

18
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:57,140
You then create a
StreetViewPanoramaCamera, which is very

19
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:01,510
similar to creating a Maps camera,
as you've done in previous modules.

20
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:05,040
Once you've done that,
on the panorama you called .animateTo,

21
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,530
the camera that you've just corrected,
and then the time in milliseconds.

22
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:10,640
And the camera will animate
to that latitude and

23
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,160
longitude as you've set it for
the location.

24
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:15,460
And you'll then see the Street View for
that.

25
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:18,990
This is all that we did to build
a Grand Canyon application,

26
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:21,240
just using this latitude and longitude.

27
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,860
See if you can go ahead and
implement this now for yourself.
