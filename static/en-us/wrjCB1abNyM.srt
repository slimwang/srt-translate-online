00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:03,920
There are a bunch of different
tables in our zoo database.

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:07,939
I'd like to just have the database tell
you about them, but weirdly enough,

3
00:00:07,939 --> 00:00:11,540
there isn't one standard
way to do that in SQL.

4
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:14,680
If you want to know what
tables are in a database, or

5
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:19,640
what columns are in a table, well, each
database system supports doing that, but

6
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:22,090
they all do it in different ways.

7
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:26,380
And in most of them, you can't do
any of these from your code itself,

8
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:30,290
only from the database console, or
special administrative software.

9
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:32,850
Yeah, that kind of sucks.

10
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:35,730
It's as if SQL was designed back
in the days when you had to

11
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:38,140
plan out your whole
application with flowcharts and

12
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:41,996
stuff, before you were allowed to touch
a computer and ask it any questions.

13
00:00:41,996 --> 00:00:45,360
Oh wait, it was.

14
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,830
So in order to save you a bunch of time
and frustration, I've put a list of

15
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:54,110
all the tables in our zoo database,
in the instructor notes below.

16
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:55,410
You might want to copy that, and

17
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:59,080
put it somewhere you can easily read it
while you do the rest of this lesson.
