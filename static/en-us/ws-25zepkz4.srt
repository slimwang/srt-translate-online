00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,522
And the answer is no. We actually don't need to do any calculations or no major

2
00:00:04,522 --> 00:00:08,977
calculations, at least, to find the last zero. It's simply the complex

3
00:00:08,977 --> 00:00:13,676
conjugate of this one non-real zero we already have, i. The complex conjugate

4
00:00:13,676 --> 00:00:17,336
of i is negative i. So that is our missing zero. Awesome.
