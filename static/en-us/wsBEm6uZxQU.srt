[Norvig] And the answer is that every permutation has a non-zero probability,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
but they don't all have the same probability.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
And let's see how I discovered that.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I wrote some test code that generated this output,

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
and what I did is I gave it some example inputs, some example decks, that were very simple.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
First I gave it the deck consisting of 3 items--a, b, and c--

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
and then I gave it the deck consisting of 2 items--a and b--

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
and I had it test for both shuffle algorithms--the correct algorithm and the teacher's algorithm.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I had it generate a few thousand decks, shuffle them,

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
and then figure out how many times each of the possible outcomes come out.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
For 3 cards there's 6 possible permutations.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Both shuffle algorithms generated all 6.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,000
For the correct shuffle algorithm you can see that they're all about 1/6 of the time.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
1/6 of the time would be 16.6667%, and they're all pretty close to that.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
For the teacher's shuffle algorithm, not so much.

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Notice that the combination abc only shows up 5% of the time,

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
whereas some of the other combinations show up 27% of the time.

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Not very good distribution of probability at all,

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
so there's something wrong with that algorithm.

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
And it's even more obvious when we just give it the trivial case of a 2-card deck.

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
With the correct algorithm it turns out to be exactly 50-50.

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
It might have been 49.1, 50.1.

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
This is just luck that it was exactly 50-50 in my simulation.

24
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
But with the teacher's algorithm, way off.

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,000
1/6 of the time you get ab, and 5/6 of the time you get ba.
