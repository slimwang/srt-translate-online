1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:04,065
So our signature, our name for
this function is r ordered.

2
00:00:04,065 --> 00:00:09,980
It'll take an input, a vector, we'll
say type integer call it x and it will

3
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:15,280
return a Boolean value, representing
whether it's in reverse order or not.

4
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,220
And we'll call that Bool y.

5
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:19,260
>> So it's exactly the same
as what we had before,

6
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:21,380
except the name of
the function is different.

7
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:23,730
It's only when we get
to preconditions and

8
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:27,432
post conditions that we're going to
see a difference between them.

9
00:00:27,432 --> 00:00:31,340
Okay, give a crack at
the precondition for this.

10
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:35,380
Okay, so for the precondition,
I fell like that one's the same.

11
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:36,460
I think-
>> You got it.

12
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:37,100
>> Okay.

13
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:39,580
>> This should be straightforward.

14
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:42,840
A precondition is going to be true, or
you can just leave out the precondition.
