1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:02,810
>> Right, so let's go back to, to 20 questions that we

2
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:06,460
talked about a number of lectures ago. And we're going to consider the following

3
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:08,904
analogy. That in, in some sense, what is a, what is a

4
00:00:08,904 --> 00:00:11,460
learner? What is an inductive learner trying to do? It's trying to find

5
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:15,680
the best hypothesis in some class H. And the hypotheses all map

6
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:18,520
input to yes or no. Let's say that what we're trying to do

7
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:22,560
in twenty questions is, deal with our hypothesis class H, which is maybe

8
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,505
a set of possible people. And so, these are the possible answers to

9
00:00:25,505 --> 00:00:28,210
the 20 questions problem. And, X is the

10
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:30,120
set of questions that you can actually ask.

11
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:32,110
So X, they're kind of like training examples. That's

12
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:34,630
how the learner's getting information about what the

13
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:37,270
right answer is. But no question, in and

14
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:39,720
of itself, might actually be sufficiently revealing of

15
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:42,220
what the hypothesis is. All right does that,

16
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:43,630
does that analogy make sense to you, Charles?

17
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:44,570
>> Makes perfect sense to me.

18
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:47,160
>> All right, good. So, now lets think about two

19
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:50,760
different cases. One where the teacher is going to try to

20
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,440
select which questions to ask. So the

21
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:53,960
teacher's going to say to the student, here's

22
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:57,350
the question you should ask me next. To try to figure out which person

23
00:00:57,350 --> 00:01:00,360
it is, as quickly as possible. And then we'll, next we'll look at what

24
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,788
happens if the learner's the one asking

25
00:01:01,788 --> 00:01:03,720
those questions. So in some sense, it doesn't

26
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:06,950
seem like it should make a difference, because, you know, in either case, the

27
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:08,270
learner is going to ask the question and

28
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:10,580
the teacher is going to answer truthfully. Just in

29
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:12,500
one case, the learner has to come up with the questions, and in the

30
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:15,820
other case the teacher has to come up with the questions. So why, why are

31
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:16,910
these different from each other? What does

32
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,840
the teacher have that the learner doesn't have?

33
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,120
>> Well, the teacher actually knows the answer.

34
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,850
>> Indeed. Alright, so let's let's just do a quick

35
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:29,120
quiz and say, how many questions are necessary for a smart

36
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:32,340
learner to figure out the right person, assuming that the teacher

37
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:35,150
is the one who gets to feed the learner good questions?

38
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:35,850
>> Okay.

39
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:36,660
>> Go.
