1
00:00:00,042 --> 00:00:06,357
And the answer is longest, and that's really important. So, let's think about how these threads would run.

2
00:00:06,357 --> 00:00:09,126
We'll start with all the threads doing useful work.

3
00:00:09,126 --> 00:00:13,297
They'll all process their first element at the same time, then their second element, and so on.

4
00:00:13,297 --> 00:00:17,682
But eventually, the threads assigned to short rows will run out of work to do,

5
00:00:17,682 --> 00:00:20,817
so they'll be idle while the longer rows continue to do work.

6
00:00:20,817 --> 00:00:24,527
This code is really efficient if all the rows have the same length.

7
00:00:24,527 --> 00:00:29,052
But it's a lot less efficient if the lengths of the rows differ, because then the threads

8
00:00:29,052 --> 00:00:33,372
with shorter rows are idle, while threads with longer rows are still working.
