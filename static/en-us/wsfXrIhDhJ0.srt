00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
This problem is about planning in belief space.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
We have the 2 room vacuum world, and we've represented various belief states here.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Now, in this version, there are no sensors and so no percepts.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
The actions are all deterministic.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
A right or left or suck action will always do what it's supposed to do,

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
and the environment is static.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
That is, dirt stays put until it's cleaned up.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Now, in the start, you know nothing about the environment.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
You have no input. You don't know what location you're in.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
You don't know where the dirt is, and your goal is to be in the leftmost of the 2 squares

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
and have both squares cleaned up, and what I want you to do

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
is click on the sequence of actions, an action like this one or this one or this one

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:56,000
or this one, that constitute a path from the start state to the goal state.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:03,000
And then I want you to click on yes if that path is guaranteed

15
00:01:03,000 --> 99:59:59,999
to always reach the goal, and no if the path only sometimes reaches the goal.
