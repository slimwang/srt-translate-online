1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Well, let's build the truth table.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
For the true location we have three choices,

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
and because this is a truth table, I write them multiple times.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
We happen to know that any of those has exactly 1/3 probability,

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
and we'll be using this 1/3 in a minute.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Now say you guess door number 2.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
With this guess Monty will show me an empty door.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
He might show me door 1, 2, or 3.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Now I have all the combinations of the true location and the door I'm being shown.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Let's talk about the probabilities of each of these entries.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
If the true location is 1, which has 1/3 chance,

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Monty hall will not show me location 1--probability 0.

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
He won't show me location number 2, because that's the one I guessed.

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
The only location he'll show to me will be automatically location 3.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
It's not the true one. It's not the one I guessed.

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
It's the only empty one that remains.

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
The probability of showing 3 given that the true location is 1 is certain,

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
but the true location is 1 only with a 1/3 chance.

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
This specific outcome that the true location is 1 and Monty Hall shows me 3

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
has exactly 1/3 of a chance.

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Now, but analogy, you can now fill out for me the three probabilities

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
that correspond to the true location being 3 and Monty showing me 1, 2, or 3

23
00:01:13,000 --> 99:59:59,999
into this these three things over here.
