1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,719
Alright. So i like this one, if you had to pick one

2
00:00:03,719 --> 00:00:06,450
differential equation as the one that advance the study of physics the

3
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:07,720
most, which one would you pick?

4
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:10,560
Hamilton's equation for Classical Mechanics, Maxwell's

5
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:13,340
for Electrodynamics, Schrodinger equation for Quantum

6
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:16,405
Mechanics, Einstein Field Equations, or something else?

7
00:00:16,405 --> 00:00:19,510
>> That's like asking me to choose between my children. I mean,

8
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:24,910
they're not my children but that is like, they're all remarkable structures.

9
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:30,235
Which one has changed the, the physics the most? Go back

10
00:00:30,235 --> 00:00:30,250
[LAUGH]

11
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:31,356
give them to me again.

12
00:00:31,356 --> 00:00:32,110
>> Hamilton.

13
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:36,750
>> Okay, so Hamilton's equations are the basic equations of classical

14
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:40,510
mechanics. They tell you how classical

15
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:42,910
mechanical systems. They have a predictive

16
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:49,590
equations for how particles move, or how anything changes with time. Obviously

17
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:55,750
they have had a enormous impact on Physics. And the impact

18
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:59,710
covers every area of physics, every area. They're

19
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:01,920
there in quantum mechanics, they're there in classical

20
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,876
mechanics, they're there in quantum field theory, they're

21
00:01:04,876 --> 00:01:06,312
every where. Okay, what was the next one?

22
00:01:06,312 --> 00:01:08,992
>> Next one is Maxwell's equations

23
00:01:08,992 --> 00:01:11,030
>> Alright, Maxwell's equations are a little

24
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:13,480
more special. They're a little more special,

25
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:15,070
they have to do with a specific

26
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:21,631
class of phenomenon. Electricity and magnetism, electromagna-, electromagnetic

27
00:01:21,631 --> 00:01:24,110
fields. So they're a little bit narrower,

28
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:26,570
but on the other hand, they did something

29
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:29,380
remarkable. They taught us what light is. Up

30
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:33,030
until Maxwell's equations, nobody knew what light was.

31
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:35,940
So how do you compare something like Maxwell's

32
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:41,510
equations with. that other fellow, Hamilton's equations. Which

33
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:43,460
one is more important? It's a matter of

34
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:46,650
taste. Do you think explaining light was more

35
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:50,890
important or less important than having a framework for, in

36
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:54,970
a sense, all of physics? It's a matter of taste.

37
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:57,186
>> I like those t shirts that have the Maxwell's equation.

38
00:01:57,186 --> 00:01:57,834
>> Have the Maxwell's equation.

39
00:01:57,834 --> 00:01:58,510
>> Let there be light.

40
00:01:58,510 --> 00:01:59,572
>> What was the third one?

41
00:01:59,572 --> 00:02:03,868
>> next was Schrodinger's equation.

42
00:02:03,868 --> 00:02:07,950
>> Okay so Schrodinger's equation there, Schrodinger's equation

43
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:12,750
has different meanings to sometimes the physicists It

44
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:14,830
can mean a very general kind of equation

45
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:16,470
which tells you how the quantum state of a

46
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:19,300
system changes with time. Or it can mean the

47
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:23,460
very specific equation that Schrodinger wrote down. The very

48
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:28,710
specific equation that SchrÃ¶dinger wrote down had to with

49
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:31,180
again a special class of phenomena, motion of a

50
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:35,100
particle, quantum mechanical motion of a particle. But there's

51
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:37,960
a, there's a generalization of it. There's a generalization

52
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:42,780
of it that has to do with how any quantum system behaves. In the sense it's

53
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:46,730
as broad and as important as Maxwell's sorry,

54
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:51,740
Hamilton's equations. It's, it is the quantum mechanics.

55
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:55,140
What Hamilton's equations were to classical mechanics. So

56
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:58,260
extremely important. But I think in the end

57
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:01,342
you're going to have a hard time getting me to say I favor one over the other.

58
00:03:01,342 --> 00:03:03,196
>> What about what about the

59
00:03:03,196 --> 00:03:04,320
field equations?

60
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,834
>> The Einstein field equations. Yes,

61
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,614
They of course are the sort of

62
00:03:12,614 --> 00:03:17,230
quintessential deep, deep, equations about what space and

63
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:20,620
time are. They're like Maxwell's equations in

64
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:23,745
that they govern a special class of phenomena,

65
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:28,300
gravity, in this case. But, they're more

66
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:31,210
than that. They're telling us something extremely deep

67
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:35,690
about the nature of space and time, that it's curved, that it it that the

68
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:43,370
geometry of space and time is not what Euclid thought it was. And how that

69
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:50,140
geometry responds to matter. So again its you, you certainly

70
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:56,034
picked what I would say are the four most important deepest favorite

71
00:03:56,034 --> 00:04:00,996
equations of a theoretical physicist for sure

72
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:06,080
I, I am going to refuse to pick between them. There are four of

73
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:10,280
them. I have four children, and never would I pick between my four children.

74
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:10,860
[LAUGH]

75
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:13,590
>> When we get a theory that describes the encompasses all

76
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:15,895
of this, is it going to be described with a differential equation?

77
00:04:15,895 --> 00:04:19,750
>> Oh boy. Is it going to, is the final theory going to be

78
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:22,480
described by a differential equation? Okay. So

79
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,540
there're a lot of people And I'm not

80
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:28,010
going to place right now. There are a lot of people who think the

81
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:32,210
world is really discreet. Space and time

82
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:35,780
might be discreet. Comes in little elementary steps.

83
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:40,610
If that's the case, then at that

84
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:45,500
level, at that, the smallest possible distances in the world. It might

85
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:50,570
mean that the mathematics of it is discrete mathematics, the mathematics of

86
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:55,730
little steps, indivisual, indivisible steps, and

87
00:04:55,730 --> 00:05:00,860
not smooth continuous evolution. If that's the case,

88
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:06,344
no, it won't be described by differential equations, but we don't know.

89
00:05:06,344 --> 00:05:09,920
If, if I knew the answer to that, I would publish it.

90
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:13,091
>> As in this classic model, the model phenomena, discretely. >>Yes.

91
00:05:13,091 --> 00:05:15,582
>> You have even with the underlaying assumptions that it's continued.

92
00:05:15,582 --> 00:05:16,028
>> Exactly

93
00:05:16,028 --> 00:05:17,370
>> For the computer programs I'll have to

94
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:17,395
[INAUDIBLE]

95
00:05:17,395 --> 00:05:22,930
>> Exactly, so see that, that in many cases it really is not possible

96
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:25,925
to tell Whether a certain equation is

97
00:05:25,925 --> 00:05:30,030
describing something which is truly continuous or whether

98
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:36,080
it's describing some discrete phenomena where the little steps occur fast enough

99
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:42,670
and one after another, too fast to be able to see. Okay, so we don't know what

100
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:44,580
the final theory of nature will be
