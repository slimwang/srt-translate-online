00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,960
So the only place in the code that we need to change is in the get method for

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:08,185
lucky search. What it does currently is returns the result of lucky search for

3
00:00:08,185 --> 00:00:13,692
every query. What we want to do is instead of that, check if the result is none

4
00:00:13,692 --> 00:00:18,710
and return something different when it is. So here's the code that does that.

5
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:22,694
I'm going to use lucky search to get the result. Then if the result is none,

6
00:00:22,694 --> 00:00:27,674
I'll return a string that says, Try searchwithpeter.info. Otherwise, I'll return

7
00:00:27,674 --> 00:00:28,763
the normal result.
