1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,863
So it turns out that this first combination of coefficients for x 6 and 1 does

2
00:00:04,863 --> 00:00:09,791
not work, this is the wrong one we can only know that though by trying out these

3
00:00:09,791 --> 00:00:14,873
different numbers, now if we could have put a negative one here and the negative

4
00:00:14,873 --> 00:00:19,878
one here that our middle term would have become 6x trans negative 1 or negative

5
00:00:19,878 --> 00:00:24,729
6x minus x which is negative 7x But unfortunately, -1 times -1 does not equal

6
00:00:24,729 --> 00:00:29,411
-5. We could do that same exact process for each of the 4 numbers in this slot

7
00:00:29,411 --> 00:00:33,443
figuring out what they would need to be over here to come up with -7 to

8
00:00:33,443 --> 00:00:38,021
eventually rule out all of the possibilities up here. Going with the same

9
00:00:38,021 --> 00:00:43,013
process down here, for the factors that have 3x and 2x in them, shows us that we

10
00:00:43,013 --> 00:00:47,693
need a -5 here and a 1 here .So that to get our middle term, we have 3x times 1

11
00:00:47,693 --> 00:00:53,577
minus 10x, or negative 7x. Negative 5 times 1 is negative 5. So this is what

12
00:00:53,577 --> 00:00:54,207
works.
