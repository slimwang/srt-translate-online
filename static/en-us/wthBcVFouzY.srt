1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:04,800
All right. So let's begin our trip down computer vision lane here.

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:08,610
So the first question you might ask is, what is computer vision?

3
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:10,460
>> What is computer vision?

4
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:11,900
>> See, I told you you were going to hear from Megan.

5
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:14,330
Well, there's a couple of ways of thinking about it.

6
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:17,630
I like this slide that I borrowed from Steve Seitz,

7
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:20,600
where he talks about every picture tells a story.

8
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,740
And one way of thinking about computer vision is the goal of

9
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:26,700
computer vision is to interpret images.

10
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:29,920
That is, say something about what's present in the scene or

11
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,080
what's actually going on.

12
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:35,020
So, what we're doing is, we're going to take images in,

13
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:38,340
and what's going to come out is something that has some meaning to it.

14
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:39,600
That is, we're going to extract,

15
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,160
we're going to create some sort of interpretations,

16
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:45,900
some sort of an understanding of what that image is representative of.

17
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:49,550
This is different, many of you may have some exposure to image processing,

18
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:51,260
which is the manipulation of images.

19
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:53,220
That's images in and images out.

20
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:56,730
And we'll talk a little bit about that because you use image processing for

21
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:58,430
per, for computer vision.

22
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:02,120
But fundamentally computer vision is about understanding something

23
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,240
that's in the image.
