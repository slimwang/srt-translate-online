00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,570
In the lesson today, all of our examples came from natural language

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:08,820
understanding. But understanding is a very journal purpose cognitive task.

3
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:11,620
Natural language understanding is just one instance of understanding.

4
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:15,440
Understanding is about making sense of the world.

5
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:22,050
The world bombards us with data that comes in many forms. Acoustic, visual,

6
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:26,720
verbal, numerical. It's a very hard problem. How do we make sense of the world?

7
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:33,460
There are three sources of power. First, we exploit constraints about the world.

8
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:38,450
We know that the world behaves in certain ways. Whether it's a physical world or

9
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:40,270
the social world, or grammatical world.

10
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:46,400
Second, we have structured knowledge representations. The structured knowledge

11
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:51,320
representations in memory capture not just knowledge and its representation, but

12
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:54,850
the organization of knowledge, and there is power in that organization.

13
00:00:56,150 --> 00:01:01,310
The power lies in the third part. Low level problem with processing helps us

14
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:04,736
activate these knowledge structures from memory. Once activated,

15
00:01:04,736 --> 00:01:08,577
these knowledge structures generate expectations that make the processing top

16
00:01:08,577 --> 00:01:12,440
down. And there's a lot of power in being able to generate those expectations.
