00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,520
We found out that the measure of the angle was 10 degrees. We really should make

2
00:00:04,532 --> 00:00:08,914
sure that this is correct. Let's make sure we can check this with our ideas of

3
00:00:08,926 --> 00:00:13,069
supplement and complement. We know the complement of angle x has to be 80

4
00:00:13,081 --> 00:00:17,488
degrees, since 80 and 10 make 90 degrees. And the supplement of angle x has to

5
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:22,362
be 170 degrees, since these two add up to 180. So, in my equation, I can replace

6
00:00:22,374 --> 00:00:27,536
the complement with 80 degrees and the supplement with 170 degrees. This allows

7
00:00:27,548 --> 00:00:32,090
me to check my work. I want to know if this answer is really true. Was the

8
00:00:32,101 --> 00:00:37,242
supplement 10 more than two times the complement? And yes, 170 degrees is equal

9
00:00:37,254 --> 00:00:42,648
to 170 degrees. Our supplement was double the complement plus 10. So we can be

10
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:47,555
assured that our answer was correct. The unknown angle was 10 degrees.
