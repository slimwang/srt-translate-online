1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
That's the mean.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Why is this useful?

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
The prices I just gave you are really the type house prices you find

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
in the region over here, which is a small section of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
where I lived for many years.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
You will see they go between $165,000 and $190,000.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
By computing the mean of $174,000,

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
you can really characterize this section of this neighborhood of Pittsburgh.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
When we look over here, we find most house prices are actually a little bit cheaper--

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
125, 148, 110, 160--but there are two outliers.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
One is 325K, but the big one is the one over here: 2.4 million.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
So do me a favor and compute the mean for this section of town over here.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 99:59:59,999
And remember, 2.4 million is the same as 2,400K.
