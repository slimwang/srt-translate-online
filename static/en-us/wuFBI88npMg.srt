00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:04,188
Next, Greg, Susan and I are going to talk about dramatic emotional personality

2
00:00:04,188 --> 00:00:09,923
disorders. These include histrionic, borderline, anti-social, and narcissistic

3
00:00:09,923 --> 00:00:15,588
personality disorders. So to start, people with histrionic personality disorder

4
00:00:15,588 --> 00:00:22,336
act in very dramatic, seductive, flamboyant and exaggerated ways. They can also

5
00:00:22,336 --> 00:00:27,651
be very emotional, intense, self-centered and shallow. So as you can imagine it

6
00:00:27,651 --> 00:00:30,738
can be very difficult to have a relationship with somebody with histrionic

7
00:00:30,738 --> 00:00:35,490
personality disorder because of how self-centered and shallow they really are.
