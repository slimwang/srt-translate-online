00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:40,760
>> Note that in this exercise, there were only seven examples and

2
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:46,240
only five features. So we could do it by hand. What would happen if the number

3
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:50,350
of examples was much larger and the number of features were much larger?

4
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:54,240
This algorithm would still work but we'll need a lot more computing power.

5
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:58,764
It is also possible that the algorithm may not be able find the right concept to

6
00:00:58,764 --> 00:01:02,690
converge to because I might be allergic to multiple meals at

7
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:05,180
multiple restaurants such as breakfast at Kim's and

8
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:09,870
lunch at Sam's. But even in that case, the benefit of this algorithm is it will

9
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:13,730
show that convergence is not possible even after many, many examples.
