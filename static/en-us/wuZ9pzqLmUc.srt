00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:04,110
All right, so let's implement
the first four steps of our flowchart.

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:07,330
We've already made a request that sort
of works, so let's start from there.

3
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:10,704
See if you can remove the part where
we're selecting the image, and instead,

4
00:00:10,704 --> 00:00:12,252
write code to select a random page.

5
00:00:12,252 --> 00:00:13,869
Once you've successfully done that,

6
00:00:13,869 --> 00:00:16,570
print out the randomly
selected page number.

7
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:17,560
Check the box when you're done.
