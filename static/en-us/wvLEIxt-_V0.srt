00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:03,620
Hope you had a lot of fun working
with the Pirate Fleet app.

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:07,020
In a short amount of time we saw just
how much you can affect an application

3
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:08,230
by writing a few lines of code.

4
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:10,380
And it was real good practice.

5
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:12,810
In the real world,
you'll make many different projects.

6
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:15,300
And many times you won't
be the original author.

7
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:16,470
But that's okay.

8
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:18,900
Sometimes it's best to start
with something that works.

9
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:20,840
And make small changes as you learn.
