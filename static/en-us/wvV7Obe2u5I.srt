00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,160
Scaffolding is a way of creating
a starting point structure for

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:06,800
your project based on a couple
of assumptions that you control.

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:10,620
If say, all you do is create single page
movie promotions during your work hours,

4
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:12,590
your gulp file might look
very similar every time.

5
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:16,350
In that case, writing it from scratch
over and over is inefficient.

6
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:20,310
And it's very likely that you've already
done the most basic form of scaffolding

7
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:23,500
plenty of times, copy and paste.

8
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:26,350
To be fair, that's a perfectly
valid way of doing things.

9
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:29,450
But it's not the most elegant
in the world of web development.

10
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:32,310
Let's take a look at some
premade scaffolding tools.

11
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:35,425
You'll find links to all three
in the instructor notes.

12
00:00:35,425 --> 00:00:36,465
If you're just starting out,

13
00:00:36,465 --> 00:00:40,035
the HTML5 Boilerplate is a nice
scaffolding starting point.

14
00:00:40,035 --> 00:00:43,805
All it does is give you a decent basis
for your CSS, HTML and JavaScript.

15
00:00:43,805 --> 00:00:47,506
It makes sure your HTML is well formed,
that fall backs are provided and

16
00:00:47,506 --> 00:00:49,080
that your CSS is normalized.

17
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,925
On top,
it ships convenient stuff like JQuery.

18
00:00:52,225 --> 00:00:55,100
It has a simple build script to
combine and minify files, but

19
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:57,850
doesn't come with Gulp or
any other advanced build tool.

20
00:00:57,850 --> 00:00:59,820
You already passed that stage.

21
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:02,630
For an intermediate solution,
check out the Web Starter Kit.

22
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:05,190
It's an opinionated starting
point that we've built at Google

23
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:07,860
that already includes a built
configuration with live editing and so

24
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:11,020
on, but
it won't fit every project out there.

25
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:13,900
And finally, Yeoman for the advanced
users, to which I'm counting you now

26
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:16,520
that you've reached almost
the end of our course.

27
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:19,000
Yeoman is the most flexible
solution of the bunch.

28
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,480
Use it together with so
called generators that fit the job.

29
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:26,080
After calling Yeoman with the generator,
in this case the web app one,

30
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,470
Yeoman asks you a few
questions about what you need,

31
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:31,600
then creates an empty project
template based on your preferences.

32
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,840
It's basically a much fancier
version of copy and paste.

33
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:37,770
Okay, why talk about this now,
at the end of the course?

34
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:40,510
There's no point in letting a
scaffolding tool generate a project and

35
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:43,020
build template that you have
no idea how to use and modify.

36
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:45,750
Now that you know all the basics,

37
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:48,470
you'll be much more confident
trying out various Yeoman tasks.
