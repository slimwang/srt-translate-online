00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Here is my implementation. It's really simple.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
I execute the following loop 100 times.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I set the crosstrack error to my robot y.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
The steering angle becomes minus my control parameter times the crosstrack error.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I call the move command with a steering angle and the given speed.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I print as an output my robot along with the steering direction.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 99:59:59,999
This simple routine just does it.
