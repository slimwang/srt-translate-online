1
00:00:00,006 --> 00:00:02,300
What do you got?

2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:06,650
>> So, I think the first one is a little
bit more obvious, or at least to me.

3
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:08,760
You can't check out a book
if it's already checked out,

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:11,150
it has to be availed to be check out.

5
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:14,070
>> Or it might be back, being rebound.

6
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:15,280
>> Sure.
>> Pages came loose and

7
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,387
they're being reglued or
something like that.

8
00:00:17,387 --> 00:00:18,670
So it has to be available.

9
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:19,660
What else?

10
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:23,340
>> And then also, I could just imagine
a scenario that you walk up and you're

11
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:26,750
trying to check something out and they
say, well, you have some outstanding

12
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:29,590
fees that need to be paid before we
let you check out anything else.

13
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:30,715
>> So you run a tough library.

14
00:00:30,715 --> 00:00:32,080
>> [LAUGH]
>> My library,

15
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:36,580
they say you want to pay
the $0.10 now or hold off on it?

16
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:38,940
And they make me pay it but
I can hold off on it.
