1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:04,620
The first step in getting your game to
make money is to make your game fun.

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:08,210
Build a game that everyone wants
to play and pay money for.

3
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:10,400
Of course,
that's easier said than done, and

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,470
this is why learning about
engagement is important.

5
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:16,090
Game engagement is all about
how to design your game

6
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:18,900
to have that addictive quality
that keeps players wanting more.

7
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:24,119
It's really important for monetization
because the more your game is played and

8
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:27,998
your users drawn into your game world,
the more money your game will make.

9
00:00:27,998 --> 00:00:31,283
Take Candy Crush as an example.

10
00:00:31,283 --> 00:00:34,258
When I play it, I'll play whenever
I have a moment to myself,

11
00:00:34,258 --> 00:00:37,462
like when I'm on the bus or just
trying to seem busy on my phone, and

12
00:00:37,462 --> 00:00:39,140
I'll try to get to the next level.

13
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:43,710
It's really simple to play and there
are always more levels for me to get to.

14
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:46,680
Just look at this level map.

15
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:47,970
I have so far to go.

16
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:50,050
I feel like I have to keep playing, and

17
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:53,540
these levels are part of why
Candy Crush is such an addicting game.

18
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:56,341
I even got my mom hooked, and
now she's a lot better at it than me.

19
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,280
So levels, like in Candy Crush,

20
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,300
are great ways to keep players coming
back, wanting to go further in the game.

21
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:05,340
But they aren't the only way.

22
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:08,410
Let's look at what
makes a game engaging.

23
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:12,240
In this lesson, we'll talk about how
to get the right level of difficulty in

24
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:17,560
your game, adding competition in
your games, making your game easy to

25
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:23,350
access and play across multiple devices,
and also turning your players into fans.

26
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:26,810
These are the four components that
we've seen all engaging games include.
