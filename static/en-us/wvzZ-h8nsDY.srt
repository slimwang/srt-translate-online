1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:01,600
Now let's see how you did.

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:06,820
Well, to change this number to 2011,
for which we have definitive numbers,

3
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:11,270
there are about 510,000
data centers in 2011

4
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:16,710
that occupied about 285.5
million square feet of space.

5
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:20,880
These numbers were taken from
datacenterknowledge.com and

6
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,750
were aggregated for 2011, and if you
look at the current numbers, you will

7
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:32,115
see estimates that go anywhere from 1
to 1-1/2 billion data centers alone.

8
00:00:32,115 --> 00:00:35,645
And of course, that has implications
on the million square feet,

9
00:00:35,645 --> 00:00:38,855
the estimate that's present
currently in the community.

10
00:00:38,855 --> 00:00:41,405
Of course, these numbers
continue changing all the time.
