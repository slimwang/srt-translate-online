1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
With this we have provided a basic mechanism

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
to record and replay arbitrary function calls

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
together with their values.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
This mechanism, in general, allows to record arbitrary interaction between program parts,

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
as well as arbitrary interaction between the program and its environment.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
But this is just a tiny slice of what can be done in record and replay.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Actually, while being pretty general, it's also pretty limited yet.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
In particular, one could store the list of calls in a file

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
such that it can be reproduced at any time,

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
handle structured elements properly, that is, lists and maps,

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
record, and possibly replay, return values too.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Record global variables, or record only a subset of all calls.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Python makes recording and replaying function calls very easy.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Especially compared to compiled languages such as Java or C.

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
So feel free to toy around and expand this code.
