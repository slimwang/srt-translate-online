00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,660
If you're familiar with C#,
you may have seen extensions before.

2
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:06,860
Or if you've done any
work with Objective-C,

3
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:10,950
you may have seen its analog
to extensions, categories.

4
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:14,680
But for many of you,
extensions could be a brand new concept.

5
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:18,860
Kind of like adding an extension to
a house, extensions offer a way to

6
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:24,180
add computed properties and methods to
an existing class, struct, or enum.

7
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:28,210
They're often used to extend types for
which you don't have access to the code,

8
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:31,180
like Apple Frameworks, or
third party libraries.

9
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:34,660
I want to walk through an example that
I adapted from an example I found on

10
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:36,250
Andrew Bancroft's blog.

11
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:38,700
Which by the way you should definitely
check out if you haven't yet.

12
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,650
You can find a link to it
in the instructor's notes.
