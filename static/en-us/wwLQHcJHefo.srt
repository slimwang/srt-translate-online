00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:05,060
To move the function to the right by one unit. We need to replace the x. In the

2
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:09,104
original function with x minus 1. So at that point, with just the translation

3
00:00:09,104 --> 00:00:14,548
to the right. We have y equals the quantity x minus 1 to the 4th. Now to move

4
00:00:14,548 --> 00:00:19,689
down by one unit. We need to subtract 1. So this is our final equation. For

5
00:00:19,689 --> 00:00:25,063
this graph over here. Y equals x minus 1 to the 4th minus 1.
