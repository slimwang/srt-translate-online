00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:01,530
Here's another challenge.

2
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:04,910
The layout that you see here
was created with Flexbox.

3
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:08,530
For all of the elements of different
colors that you see on the screen,

4
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:10,070
type in the width and

5
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:13,780
the order of the element that would
be needed to create this layout.

6
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:15,160
I'll give you the first one.

7
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:16,040
The light green box and

8
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:21,350
the top covers the entire span of
the viewport, so its width is 100%.

9
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:22,210
And this would be common for

10
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:26,250
something like a navbar, and
it comes first on the page.

11
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:27,640
So I'll set its order to 0.

12
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,770
Now you go ahead and fill out the rest
