1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,300
So for this quiz, the question is, given the variables

2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:05,490
that are defined here, and you'll see the variables already defined

3
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:07,970
in the code in your web browser. Your goal is

4
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:11,890
to write Python code that prints out the distance, in meters,

5
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:16,000
that light travels in one processor cycle. Do the first

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,085
variable as speed of light, and we've assigned to the variable

7
00:00:19,085 --> 00:00:21,860
speed_of_light the number of meters that light travels in a

8
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:25,270
second. It might be hard to remember that. So we also

9
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:28,050
have a comment there. We haven't used comments yet but they're

10
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:31,420
a very useful thing to add to our programs. We can write

11
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:34,925
a comment by starting with a hash symbol, that's usually the

12
00:00:34,925 --> 00:00:38,320
Shift+3 on most keyboards. Everything from the hash to the end of

13
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,190
the line is a comment. That means it's ignored by the

14
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:44,310
Python interpreter, but it's useful for the programmer to be able to

15
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:46,990
see it. So we'll have a comment here that says that's

16
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:50,970
meters per second. We can put anything we want in our comments.

17
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:54,290
They are not interpreted by the Python interpreter. But it's a

18
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:57,230
good idea to have comments that are helpful for us to remember

19
00:00:57,230 --> 00:00:58,880
what we did if we need to go back to the

20
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:02,220
code a few months from now and understand it. It's also a

21
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:04,790
good idea if someone else is reading the code, the comments

22
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:06,478
will help them understand it. So

23
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:09,678
the second variable, we'll call cycles_per_second,

24
00:01:09,678 --> 00:01:13,025
and we'll give that the value 2 billion 700 million. And

25
00:01:13,025 --> 00:01:16,157
I'm going to give it a decimal point so when Python does division,

26
00:01:16,157 --> 00:01:18,910
we'll get exact results. And we'll also give a

27
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:23,266
comment for this one to indicate that this is the

28
00:01:23,266 --> 00:01:27,140
2.7 Gigahertz speed that the processor in my computer

29
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:30,610
has. So now, given those two variable definitions, your goal

30
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:32,630
is to write some Python code that prints out

31
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:35,620
the distance, in meters, that light travels in one processor

32
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:38,400
cycle. And we can compute that by dividing the

33
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,300
speed of light by the number of cycles per second.
