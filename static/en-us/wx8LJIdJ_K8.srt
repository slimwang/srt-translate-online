00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,887
The best answer is that we have lots of SMs that are idle.

2
00:00:03,887 --> 00:00:08,553
We know how to keep threads busy within one SM as we did in our immediate merge,

3
00:00:08,553 --> 00:00:13,082
but we don't know how to keep lots of SMs busy if we have only one task to do,

4
00:00:13,082 --> 00:00:17,526
and it's not at all efficient to have most of our SMs sitting idle.
