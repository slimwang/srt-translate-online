1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,400
Well, I went with speed up.

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:05,390
My reasoning stems from
the definition of power.

3
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:07,310
It's energy divided by time.

4
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:11,460
Energy is like algorithmic work and
the algorithmic work would basically be

5
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:15,400
the same thing as the time to execute
the algorithm on a single processor.

6
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:19,150
So the time on one processor divided
by the time on p processors,

7
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:23,810
looks like energy, which is work,
divided by the time on p processors.

8
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:25,550
Now think about that for a second.

9
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:27,280
If you need to run at low power,

10
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:32,040
then either you need to use very little
energy, or you need to go really slow.

11
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:33,610
So if you're energy optimal,

12
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:37,620
then there's a fundamental
tension between speed and power.

13
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:42,120
High speed is less time,
which would appear to imply more power.

14
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:45,070
This probably explains why
my de-identified no-name

15
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:49,160
brand cell phone has a pretty good
battery life but runs slow as [BLEEP].

16
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,680
Oops, did I say [BLEEP]?

17
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,760
Can you drop f bombs in OMSCS?
