1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:01,010
Good job.

2
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:04,030
When the device's language is not
called out explicitly, the app will use

3
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:08,640
the default values, which are the ones
in the unqualified resource directory.

4
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:09,360
In this case,

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,650
that would be the string select
small file from the values folder.
