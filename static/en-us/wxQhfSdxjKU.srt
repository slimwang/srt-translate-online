00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,469
when we talk about computer vision were
literally talking about using algorithms

2
00:00:04,469 --> 00:00:09,539
to let a computer see the world like we
see it full of depth and color and

3
00:00:09,539 --> 00:00:14,609
shapes and meaning computer vision is a
really broad field and right now we're

4
00:00:14,609 --> 00:00:19,439
just going to focus on a few features
later in the nanodegree program will be

5
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:23,699
getting much more in depth with the
tools and techniques used in computer

6
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:28,140
vision for self-driving cars at this
point will introduce you to two powerful

7
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:31,949
techniques that you use for your first
project where you'll be identifying the

8
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:34,079
lane lines and an image of the road

9
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,500
the first technique will look at is
canny edge detection so let's give it a

00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:37,558
go
