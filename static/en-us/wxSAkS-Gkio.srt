1
00:00:02,638 --> 00:00:04,918
Hey how you feeling?

2
00:00:04,918 --> 00:00:06,518
>> So much better.

3
00:00:06,518 --> 00:00:12,320
>> Yeah, it really looks like
you're getting a lot done.

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,530
>> I think he's in the zone now.

5
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:14,840
>> Yeah,
I think we should leave him alone.

6
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:15,468
>> Yeah.

7
00:00:15,468 --> 00:00:18,700
>> Well, anyway, we just scratched
the surface of code editors.

8
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:20,280
But now you know it's out there.

9
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:22,980
And just like everybody's different and
has their own way of doing things,

10
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:24,720
it's the same with code.

11
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:25,600
>> That's right.

12
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,500
You should go out and
experiment with different code packages,

13
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,666
keyboard shortcuts,
maybe even try a new code editor.

14
00:00:31,666 --> 00:00:33,500
You'd be surprised at
how fun it can be and

15
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,660
how easy it is to improve
your workflow that way.

16
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:38,322
>> Yeah, you'll have a chance
to practice in the next lesson.

17
00:00:38,322 --> 00:00:41,340
You're going to dive deeper into
the layout and sizing of elements.

18
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:41,953
I'll see you there.
