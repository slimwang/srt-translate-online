1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,440
So one of the first things I want to do is add a button right

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:05,570
here that plays some audio.

3
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:08,240
Let me drag out the Utility area and

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:13,752
then go find the button, and then drag that on to the canvas here.

5
00:00:13,752 --> 00:00:16,770
Now, I'm going to change the image of this button in a little bit.

6
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:19,730
But before I do that, I want to think about where I am going to

7
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:23,410
write the code that will execute when I press this button.

8
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:26,190
In essence, where do I write the action for

9
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:29,340
this button using the control+drag technique?

10
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:33,240
Let's think about how we did for the stop button in the previous scene.

11
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:37,280
I am going to select this scene and then go to the Assistant Editor.

12
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,835
So you may recall that we control+dragged from this stop button to this file,

13
00:00:41,835 --> 00:00:46,590
viewcontroller.swift and created an action called stopAudio.

14
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:50,550
So what we need to do now is create a new viewcontroller for

15
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,650
this second scene in our app.

16
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:56,650
All right, to do that I will first manage some screen space by going back to

17
00:00:56,650 --> 00:00:57,840
the standard editor.

18
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,760
Then I will go to the File menu at the top, click on New, and

19
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,350
then create a new File.

20
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:07,320
Here, under iOS on the left, I will select a Cocoa Touch Class, and

21
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:07,830
then click Next.

22
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:12,500
I will call this class, PlaySoundsViewController.

23
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:16,420
Now, this is going to be a subclass of UIViewController,

24
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:20,210
because we want to inherit metrics like view did load, etcetera.

25
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:23,550
Our language is still Swift, and I will hit Next.

26
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:27,930
And I will save this new class in the same folder as my app and hit Create.

27
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:32,970
All right, so we now have a new file called PlaySoundsViewController.swift with

28
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:35,440
a class by the same name inside it.

29
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:40,670
So, the next thing to do here is to go back to the storyboard, and

30
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:44,980
connect this second scene in our app here to the new file that we just made.

31
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:49,090
So I will select this second scene and then open the Utilities tray.

32
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:52,720
In here under Identity Inspector, you will notice that the cut and

33
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,130
view controller is this guy, UIViewController.

34
00:01:56,130 --> 00:02:00,710
I can substitute this with PlaySoundsViewController, and

35
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:05,024
as I start typing Escort auto completes it for me.

36
00:02:05,024 --> 00:02:08,639
All right, so let's make the action for this button now.

37
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:13,670
I can go to the Assistant editor and on the left here, I see my storyboard.

38
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:18,080
And on the right I see the view controller that this scene is associated with,

39
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,320
which is the new file we created, PlaySoundsViewController.swift.

40
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:26,790
If I go to my first scene, you will notice that he view controller on

41
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:30,740
the right hand side of the screen changes which is ViewController.swift.

42
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:35,600
So I can hop back and forth between my first scene and the second scene in

43
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:39,740
the app, and the view controller for it changes automatically.

44
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:42,840
The reason why that happens is because we have this automatic setting

45
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,290
selected over here.

46
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:46,220
All right, now we can create an action for

47
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:48,235
this button in this new ViewController.
