00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:04,430
So far, we know that our app can
contain Java files and resources.

2
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:06,770
We can provide default resources for
our app.

3
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:09,030
But we can also provide
alternate resources,

4
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:13,030
depending on the user's physical
device size, language setting,

5
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:16,116
version of Android, or number of
pixels on the screen, to name a few.

6
00:00:16,116 --> 00:00:20,980
In our just Java app, we can provide
default text strings in English.

7
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:24,170
We can provide alternate text
strings in other languages.

8
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:27,510
So if someone has French as
a default language on their device,

9
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:30,800
the system will automatically
load the French translations

10
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,580
instead of the default English ones.
