00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,019
It turns out we can always set up a proportion to solve direct and inverse

2
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:08,084
variation problems. Let's try this one out. For this problem the area of a

3
00:00:08,084 --> 00:00:13,166
circle varies directly with the square of it's radius. A circle with a side

4
00:00:13,166 --> 00:00:18,370
length of 3 inches has an area of 28 and 278 thousandths inches squared. What is

5
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:22,774
the area of circle with a radius of 4 and 1 tenth inches? Now this problem is

6
00:00:22,774 --> 00:00:26,782
very similar to the last one we just did. Except you need to include on more

7
00:00:26,782 --> 00:00:30,350
thing. We're not just varying directly, we're varying directly with the square

8
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:33,820
of something. What do you think you're going to do? Try playing around with this

9
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:37,940
one and I hope you'll get it. Good luck. Also you don't want to round while you

10
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:41,562
solve the problem. When you find the final answer, round your answer to the

11
00:00:41,562 --> 00:00:46,342
nearest thousandth. And again, I've already included the unit here of inches

12
00:00:46,342 --> 00:00:48,613
squared, so just write in your area here.
