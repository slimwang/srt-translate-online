The answer is no, there is a another way to factor x square plus 1. We can

2
00:00:13,351 --> 00:00:25,086
rewrite this using a middle term as x squared plus 0x plus 1. And if we try to

3
00:00:25,086 --> 00:00:27,564
factor this, we're looking for what two numbers a and b add equals 0, and

4
00:00:27,564 --> 00:00:29,549
multiply it to equal 1. However, if a plus b equals 0 and that means that a is

5
00:00:29,549 --> 00:00:31,277
equal to negative b, that means one of the most negative, and one of the most be

6
00:00:31,277 --> 00:00:35,301
positive. And any positive number multiply by negative number gives us the

7
00:00:35,301 --> 00:00:38,794
negative number, so their product can't be 1. Now of course, the product would

8
00:00:38,794 --> 00:00:40,744
be zero, then this equation would be true, but then their product would be 0 not

9
00:00:40,744 --> 00:00:42,237
1. Either way, there is no way to factor this. This is pretty interesting.
