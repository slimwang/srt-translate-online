1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,990
When you go to the interview,
especially for Android positions,

2
00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:04,530
I think it's important to have, and

3
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:07,990
spend some effort in putting together
a portfolio of what you built.

4
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:10,960
A lot of times people just refer
you to their GitHub account, and

5
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,600
they'll have a ton of repose.

6
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:15,810
None of them have been touched,
or they're not complete.

7
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:19,560
So, I think, when you structure it,
structure it, maybe, if you can,

8
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:23,410
build a portfolio page of apps that
you've developed in your GitHub page,

9
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:24,350
think of them the same way.

10
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:25,700
So put in screenshots.

11
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:27,220
Not everyone's going to build your apps.

12
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:28,790
But people are going
to look at your code.

13
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:31,840
So put in some description of,
in the read me, so that people can see

14
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,720
initially of what the app does,
what it was targeted, why you built it.

15
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:37,010
I think those are all important things.

16
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:41,000
Because when I get a developer, one of
the first things I do after I talk to

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,870
them or even beforehand is look at their
GitHub page and look at their code,

18
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:47,240
because I think that gives you
a sense of, they have no restrictions.

19
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,740
This is how they would
program on their own and

20
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:51,700
the quality of the code they produce.

21
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:54,780
When you're interviewing for
a job, they're also looking for

22
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:56,610
a company that's right fit for you.

23
00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:01,030
So I think it's important and depending
on the company, they might be willing or

24
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:02,340
not willing to do it.

25
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:05,510
But getting a sense of
the culture is important, and

26
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:08,060
also if you can,
getting a sense of the code base.

27
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:12,790
If you can look at the code and kind of
see how developers are developing within

28
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:16,120
that company, and if you think it's
something where it looks promising that

29
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:19,630
you could learn a great deal from,
you should definitely go into it.
