00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,458
Through helping Grant mull over this cleaning solution issue, we learned about

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:08,865
the use and the importance of points of intersections on graphs. When two lines

3
00:00:08,877 --> 00:00:13,033
cross one another, the coordinates of the point where that happens give us

4
00:00:13,045 --> 00:00:17,352
values of variables that satisfy the equations of all of the lines that pass

5
00:00:17,364 --> 00:00:22,319
through that point. So, we are able to use this knowledge to solve for different

6
00:00:22,331 --> 00:00:27,016
variables. We could just take the equations corresponding to either line, figure

7
00:00:27,028 --> 00:00:31,410
out how to set one side of one equation equal to one side of the other equation,

8
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:35,993
and then solve for the unknown variable. That would give us a new coordinate of

9
00:00:36,005 --> 00:00:40,662
that point of intersection. But, what if instead we didn't have a graph? What if

10
00:00:40,674 --> 00:00:46,344
you just had an equation, and not just any equation but an equation with one

11
00:00:46,356 --> 00:00:51,790
variable, something like 3 x plus 4 equals 19? Now that we know we can find

12
00:00:51,802 --> 00:00:57,745
values for variables through finding points of intersection of lines, can you

13
00:00:57,757 --> 00:01:02,630
think of two lines we could graph whose point of intersection would help us

14
00:01:02,642 --> 00:01:07,360
solve this equation? Please put a two variable equation in each of these boxes

15
00:01:07,372 --> 00:01:11,755
that we could graph on the same coordinate plane to help us work with this

16
00:01:11,767 --> 00:01:16,619
equation. This definitely requires a little bit of outside the box thinking. So,

17
00:01:16,631 --> 00:01:17,682
just give it a try.
