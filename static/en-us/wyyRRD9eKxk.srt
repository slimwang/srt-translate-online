1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,166
So now we have an idea about the half-life being larger than the lifetime, but we can also actually compute the half-life

2
00:00:09,167 --> 00:00:17,066
from the lifetime. This is what we've seen before, the differential equation for the exponential decay, 20 seconds being the lifetime.

3
00:00:17,067 --> 00:00:30,666
This is its solution. Here's one more ingredient: A is equal to E to the power of B if, and only if, the natural logarithm of A

4
00:00:30,667 --> 00:00:37,799
equals B. Use this to determine the half-life in this situation.

5
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:46,066
So what's the half-life? Is it 20 seconds divided by the natural logarithm of two, minus 20 seconds times the natural logarithm

6
00:00:46,067 --> 00:00:54,232
of one half? 20 seconds times the natural logarithm of two? Or minus 20 seconds times the natural logarithm of two?

7
00:00:54,233 --> 00:00:56,467
Check all that apply.
