00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,533
Eventually, you'll be able to picture this in your head. We know the rise is the

2
00:00:04,533 --> 00:00:08,842
change in the y values. So we went down 3, or negative 3. And then run is the

3
00:00:08,842 --> 00:00:13,253
change in the x values. So we went 3 units to the right, from 4 to 7. If you can

4
00:00:13,253 --> 00:00:17,882
picture this stuff in your head, that's amazing. If you can't, that's okay too.

00:00:17,882 --> 00:00:22,243
Understanding what rise and run mean can really help you understand the slope

00:00:22,243 --> 00:00:22,850
formula.
