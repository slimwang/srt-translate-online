1
00:00:00,154 --> 00:00:03,177
Each expression has a watcher,
and there are six expressions.

2
00:00:03,177 --> 00:00:06,137
So you might think that the answer is 6,
but

3
00:00:06,137 --> 00:00:10,220
since these two expressions
are the same, the answer is 5.

4
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:12,860
One watcher for each unique expression.

5
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:15,430
This one was a little tricky, so
great job working through it.
