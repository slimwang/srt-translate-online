1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
And this is easiest seen by providing all the extra data.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Let me do this here, there's two of age 19, 3 times the age 22, two aged 23, 24 and 25

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
and now we can call this at exactly 11.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
This is where you'll find the lower quartile, the median and the upper quartile.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 99:59:59,999
That's 20, 22 and 23.
