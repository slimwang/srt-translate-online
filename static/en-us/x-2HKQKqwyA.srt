1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,360
I call the four major areas of
a web up's life cycle Rail.

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:08,660
Rail stands for response,
animations, idle, and load.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:10,740
>> Wait.

4
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:12,000
That's not chronological order.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,520
Shouldn't it be Liar, load,
idle, animation, response?

6
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:17,080
>> Okay.

7
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:18,010
Yeah, maybe.

8
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:21,900
It turns out liar is a less
popular acronym than rail, okay?

9
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:24,000
It's just a good way to remember it,
and yeah,

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,030
even though, you do loads at the start,

11
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:31,240
most apps do multiple loads with XHRs
and web sockets and HTML imports.

12
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,729
So, you know, like chill out, right?

13
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:33,430
>> All right.

14
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:36,010
>> Anyway, orders of letters,
not withstanding, it's

15
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:39,340
really a useful way to conceptualize and
group your apps workload.

16
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:42,280
To keep you happy though,
let's do them in chronological order.

17
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,110
>> I appreciate that.

18
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:43,610
>> Okay.
