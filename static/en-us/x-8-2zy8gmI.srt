00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:02,170
I told you that this was a really tricky quiz.

2
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:04,550
So if you got it right, good job.

3
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:07,250
Let's walk through the answers one at a time.

4
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:10,220
The first possibility that you minimize the error on the first and

5
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:13,970
the last data points isn't a bad thing to be keeping in mind.

6
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:17,580
You certainly want to have a good fit to the first and last data points.

7
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:20,000
But you could easily end up with something like this.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,300
Where the trend of the data as a whole, may look like this.

9
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:25,150
But if you're only basing it on the first and

10
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:28,250
last points, you would ignore all the data in between and

11
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:32,000
come up with something that isn't fitting the pattern as a whole.

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:32,900
The next choice,

13
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:37,910
the sum of the error on all the data points might have sounded like a good idea.

14
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:40,250
But here's one place that it can go wrong.

15
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:43,200
Suppose you have really lovely linear data like this.

16
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,010
But you fit it with a regression that looks like this.

17
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:48,250
Clearly not a very good fit.

18
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:51,990
However, if this error is, let's say negative 100.

19
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:55,360
And this error is positive 100.

20
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:59,060
Then these two will cancel each other out.

21
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:01,170
And likewise for this point.

22
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:03,640
This point, this point, and this point.

23
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:08,990
So, the sum of the error in this case,

24
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:12,340
will actually be zero even though it's a terrible fit.

25
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:14,680
That's why we usually don't use the sum of the errors.

26
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,260
Two things that will work a little bit better,

27
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:21,610
will be the sum of the absolute value of the error.

28
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:24,299
So, in this case what would happen is we will turn all of these

29
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:27,920
into positive errors.

30
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,760
These three points right here and then these were already positive.

31
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:33,520
So all together,

32
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:38,140
the sums of the absolute values of the errors will be quite large.

33
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:39,370
So that would probably work.

34
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:43,810
And the last thing that will work, and that we'll explore in more detail,

35
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:47,730
this is actually how linear regressions are calculated,

36
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:52,100
is by minimizing the sum of the squared error on all the data points.

37
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:54,990
This has the advantages that you get with the absolute value of

38
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:58,390
the error because even if you have an error that's negative.

39
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:01,130
When you square it, it becomes positive, and of course,

40
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:04,610
if it's positive to begin with, it'll still be positive after you square it.

41
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:05,560
So, this will work as well.
