00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,940
Here's what your layout code
should look like when you're done.

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:06,110
If you set the android.text
the same way as I did,

3
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:09,860
by referencing a string
using @string/add_geofences,

4
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:14,030
you'll also need a strings.xml
file with content like this.

5
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:18,010
Here you can see I have a string
that I call add_geofences, and

6
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:21,380
I put the text add_geofences
into that string.

7
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:26,840
So now, when I draw my activity,
my button will be using that string.

8
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:30,580
This is always handy for localizing or
if you want to change it later to

9
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:33,370
geofences capitalized or
something along those lines.

10
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:35,770
Other than that,
it's a very straightforward button, and

11
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:38,440
I've added the onClick handler here.

12
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:42,180
I'm just saying, android:onClick
equals add.GeofencesButtonHandler.

13
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:45,740
Of course, that can be done at
runtime in the onCreate event, but

14
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:48,100
I've done it in here now just
to make things a little simpler.
