00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,640
In summary, here's some of
the key architectural features

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:06,230
of distributed shared memory systems.

3
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:10,570
Specifically we're talking about page
based distributed shared memory systems.

4
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:15,380
Every node contributes part of its
main memory pages to the DSM layer.

5
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:18,800
Local caches are maintained
to improve performance

6
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:23,170
by minimizing the latency of
the access to story node modes.

7
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:27,160
All nodes are responsible for some
portion of the distributed memory and

8
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,090
of its management.

9
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:33,785
Specifically, the home node for a page
manages the accesses to that page and

10
00:00:33,785 --> 00:00:36,670
also tracks who
currently owns that page.

11
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:38,630
Who has ownership rights.

12
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:41,460
And finally, some explicit replication

13
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:45,330
could be considered in order
to assist with load balancing.

14
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:48,540
In order to further
improve performance and

15
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:50,600
to address certain reliability concerns.
