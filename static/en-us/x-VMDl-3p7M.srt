00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:05,858
Okay. So, for a population of size 350 million, how would we find the standard

2
00:00:05,858 --> 00:00:11,229
deviation of the distribution of sample means? Well, let's start with what we

3
00:00:11,229 --> 00:00:16,167
know from our simple example so far. Let's calculate the population standard

4
00:00:16,167 --> 00:00:21,249
deviation sigma, and then, let's also calculate the standard deviation of all

5
00:00:21,249 --> 00:00:25,994
our sample means, let's call this SE. All the sample means are also written at

6
00:00:25,994 --> 00:00:30,570
the bottom and in iInstructor notes if you want to refer to those. So calculate

7
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:35,930
the standard deviation of this population and the standard deviation of all the

8
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:38,696
sample means, where the sample is size 2.
