1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
So this is a planning question.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
And I apologize, it's a little bit hard to read.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
There's a lot of text here.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
And I ask you to consult the pdf document to read the text.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Given the resources on the left, over here,

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
can we reach those five goals;

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
A, B, C, D, E, on the right side?

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
And in looking at those, there's words like 'consume',

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
which means, the action eliminates the resource.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Whereas 'use' means,

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
you have to have it, but you retain it after using it.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Now initially, you know there's a couple of books;

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
one by Nau, about planning,

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
one by Zweben, about scheduling,

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
and one by Melville, about Whales.

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
And there's also videos.

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Video 8 is about Planning.

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
And Video 15 is about Scheduling.

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
These might be our in-class videos.

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
That's your initial state.

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
And your goal is that you, as a student,

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
know about planning,

23
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
and you know about scheduling.

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
So the question is, with certain resources

25
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
that are available in the beginning,

26
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
and they differ from question to question,

27
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
can you attain the state of knowing about planning and scheduling?

28
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Now, there's two ways to know about a topic.

29
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
One is to study it using a book.

30
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
And one is to view it using a video.

31
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
In both cases, the outcome is to know about the topic over here.

32
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Now either one has a different precondition.

33
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
In the 'book' case, you have to have the book,

34
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
and the book has to be about the topic you care about.

35
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
In which case, the action 'study'

36
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
lets you understand the book and you know about the topic.

37
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
So for example, if you have a book about planning,

38
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
and study it, then you know about planning.

39
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
In the 'view' case, you have to have a video that's about the topic,

40
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
and you have to have a certain bandwidth,

41
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
which happens to be 2.5.

42
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
If you don't have the bandwidth 2.5, you won't be able to view the video,

43
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
and you won't be able to know about the topic.

44
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
That's the way the problem is set up.

45
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Now, books can be bought or borrowed.

46
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
In the buying case, you consume 50 dollars

47
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
In the borrowing case,

48
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
you have to have a privilege, at the library, that's at least '1'.

49
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
It might be larger but it can't be lower than '1'.

50
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
And in either case after doing this, you have the book,

51
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
and you can now plug this into the 'study' action,

52
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
and you can read about it,

53
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
and study it, and know the topic.

54
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
So here are the questions.

55
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
If your resource is that you have 50 dollars,

56
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
and you have library privileges of '1',

57
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
can you then attain the state of

58
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
knowing about planning and scheduling?

59
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Secondly, suppose your resources is no dollars,

60
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
but you have library privileges of '2',

61
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
can you attain the same state?

62
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Third, what about the same with library privileges of '1'?

63
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Can you get here?

64
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Fourth, what about if you have 40 dollars,

65
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
and bandwidth of '3'? Can you get here?

66
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,000
And fifth, what about if you have bandwidth of '2', and 95 dollars?

67
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Can you get here?

68
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Check all, or any, or none

69
00:03:28,000 --> 99:59:59,999
of those five questions that apply.
