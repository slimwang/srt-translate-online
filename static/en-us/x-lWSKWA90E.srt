1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,601
Well, this is a tough one.

2
00:00:01,601 --> 00:00:04,939
The answer is either b or c.

3
00:00:04,939 --> 00:00:09,010
Look, as long as you keep track of what's going on, it doesn't matter.

4
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:11,979
You can do whatever you want, which case it would be c.

5
00:00:11,979 --> 00:00:15,143
Remember before I showed you those correlation operators that I'm

6
00:00:15,143 --> 00:00:18,486
doing correlations, because I want to know which way is the right way?

7
00:00:18,486 --> 00:00:20,521
So the right versus to the left.

8
00:00:20,521 --> 00:00:23,026
So I think when you're doing filtering for

9
00:00:23,026 --> 00:00:26,794
gradients, doing correlation probably works better for you.

10
00:00:26,794 --> 00:00:28,714
And by the way, so in the old days,

11
00:00:28,714 --> 00:00:33,235
we used to have to either call correlation or convolution explicitly in Matlab.

12
00:00:33,235 --> 00:00:36,705
Now we tend to use i m filter, as we've talked about before.

13
00:00:36,705 --> 00:00:41,175
I m filter by default does correlation.

14
00:00:41,175 --> 00:00:44,045
So if you want convolution, make sure you tell it.

15
00:00:44,045 --> 00:00:45,093
All right?

16
00:00:45,093 --> 00:00:46,820
So you just have to keep track of that.
