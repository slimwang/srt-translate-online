What's great about knowing scientific notation an the property of exponents, is

2
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:07,320
that it can make these types of calculations a lot easier. We can actually

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:11,105
perform this without using a calculator. First I can change each of the numbers

4
00:00:11,105 --> 00:00:14,696
into scientific notation and I need to make sure that I'm multiplying these

5
00:00:14,696 --> 00:00:18,374
together, we still have multiplication between each of the numbers. This

6
00:00:18,374 --> 00:00:22,406
numerator and this denominator are really just products of factors, so I can

7
00:00:22,406 --> 00:00:26,289
regroup things. I'm going to regroup my powers of 10 next to one another, and

8
00:00:26,289 --> 00:00:30,377
put the numbers next to one another. And here's where our exponent properties

9
00:00:30,377 --> 00:00:34,298
come into play. I want you to simplify these powers of 10. What would be the

10
00:00:34,298 --> 00:00:38,438
single exponent on the power of 10, if we simplified this part of the fraction?

11
00:00:38,438 --> 00:00:40,032
Write your answer in this box.
