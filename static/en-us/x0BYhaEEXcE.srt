00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:05,330
We said earlier that threads can exist at both the kernel and the user level.

2
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:08,810
Let's take a look more at what we mean by this distinction.

3
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:13,670
Kernel level threads imply that the operating system itself is multithreaded.

4
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:16,660
Kernel level threads are visible to the kernel, and

5
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:21,010
are managed by kernel level components like the kernel level scheduler.

6
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:25,560
So, it is the operating system scheduler that will decide how these kernel level

7
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:29,190
threads will be mapped onto the underlined physical CPUs, and

8
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:31,990
which one of them will execute at any given point of time.

9
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:36,040
Some of these kernel level threads may be there to directly support some of

10
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:36,910
the processes.

11
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:40,120
So, they may execute some of the user-level threads and

12
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:43,550
other kernel level threads may be there just to run certain OS level

13
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:45,890
services like daemons, for instance.

14
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:49,480
At the user level, the processes themselves, are multi-threaded, and

15
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:51,390
these are the user level threads.

16
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:54,680
For a user level thread to actually execute,

17
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:58,940
first, it must be associated with a kernel level thread.

18
00:00:58,940 --> 00:00:59,620
And then,

19
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:05,260
the OS level scheduler must schedule that kernel level thread onto a CPU.

20
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:10,530
So let's investigate a little more, what is the relationship that exists between

21
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:13,150
user level threads and kernel level threads.

22
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:16,270
In fact, there's several possible relationships between the user

23
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:18,770
level threads and the kernel level threads.

24
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:20,440
And we will now look at three such models.
