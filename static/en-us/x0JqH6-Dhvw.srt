00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,549
Okay, now we're going to learn
another very powerful method to split

2
00:00:03,549 --> 00:00:04,339
points in the plane.

3
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:08,289
So let's say we have thee four
points arranged like this and

4
00:00:08,289 --> 00:00:09,759
we want to split them.

5
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:12,839
It seems again that
a line won't do the job

6
00:00:12,839 --> 00:00:16,460
since they're already over the line and
the red ones are on the sides.

7
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:19,100
So we need to think outside the box.

8
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:23,590
One way to think out of the box is to
use a curve like this to split them.

9
00:00:23,589 --> 00:00:26,440
Another one is to actually
think outside the plane.

10
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:29,170
And think of the points as lying
in three dimensional space.

11
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:33,079
Here are the four points over the plane.

12
00:00:33,079 --> 00:00:37,039
We add an extra axis,
the z axis for the third dimension.

13
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:41,700
And if we can find a way to
lift the two green points,

14
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,940
then we'd be able to
separate them with a plane.

15
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:48,710
So what seems like the better solution,
to think within the plane and

16
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:51,219
separate the points with a curve?

17
00:00:51,219 --> 00:00:54,399
Or to think of the points in space,
and separate them with a plane?

18
00:00:55,609 --> 00:00:58,572
Well, it turns out that these two
are actually the same method.

19
00:00:58,572 --> 00:01:02,475
Don't worry if it seems confusing,
we'll see it in more detail later.

20
00:01:02,475 --> 00:01:04,665
This method is called the Kernel Trick,
and

21
00:01:04,665 --> 00:01:06,965
it's very well used in
support vector machines.

22
00:01:08,344 --> 00:01:12,819
Okay, so let's study one of them in more
detail, let's study the curve trick.

23
00:01:12,819 --> 00:01:15,609
First, let's start by putting
coordinates on the points.

24
00:01:15,609 --> 00:01:18,310
So this one is (0,3).

25
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:20,129
This one is (1,2).

26
00:01:20,129 --> 00:01:21,219
This one is (2,1).

27
00:01:21,219 --> 00:01:23,201
And this one is (3,0).

28
00:01:23,201 --> 00:01:27,750
And what we need is a way to separate
the green points from the red points.

29
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:31,890
So if the points coordinates are (x,y),
maybe we need an equation

30
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:35,159
on the variables x and
y that gives us large values for

31
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:40,129
the green points and small values for
the red points, or vice versa.

32
00:01:40,129 --> 00:01:42,860
So which of the following equations
could come to our rescue?

33
00:01:42,861 --> 00:01:44,647
[BLANK_AUDIO]

34
00:01:44,647 --> 00:01:50,109
The sum of the two coordinates x + y,
the product of the coordinates,

35
00:01:50,109 --> 00:01:54,829
xy or the first coordinates squared,
x squared.

36
00:01:54,829 --> 00:01:56,239
