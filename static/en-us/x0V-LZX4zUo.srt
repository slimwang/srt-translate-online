00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Here's how refinement planning works.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
In addition to regular actions, we have abstract actions

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
like going from my home to the San Francisco airport.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Then we have possible ways to take to refine these abstract options into concrete actions.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Here one refinement is I can drive from home to long-term parking

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
and then take the shuttle to the airport.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Another refinement is I can just take a taxi.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Here's another example of an abstract action,

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
which is if I'm at one point on a grid, ab, and I want to get to point xy,

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
and if I know the grid is all connected,

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
and I have this abstract action of just navigating from ab to xy.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
One refinement says if I'm already there I do nothing.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Another refinement says I can start the journey by going left.

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Another refinement says I can start the journey by going right and so on.

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
The idea is I can figure out a complex plan that involves

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
navigating around picking up and object, doing something else,

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
and do that planning just at the level of abstract actions like navigate

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
rather than having to figure out a path from ab to xy.

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
How do we know when we have a solution?

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
A hierarchical task network achieves the goal if for every part, every abstract action,

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
at least one of the refinements achieves the goal.

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
We only need to at least one of them, because we're the planner.

23
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
We get to make the choice.

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
It's like an and/or search where we can make the best possible choices,

25
00:01:33,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and if any of the choices work, then the goal can be achieved.
