1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,303
So counting lets us think about quantities
of objects and answer questions about

2
00:00:05,303 --> 00:00:11,460
them, whether it's how many students are
in a teacher's class or how many moons

3
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:17,178
orbit Saturn. Now, usually, when we count,
we start with the number one and then we

4
00:00:17,178 --> 00:00:24,192
get to two, and three, four, and so on so
forth. And we could keep counting like

5
00:00:24,192 --> 00:00:33,155
that until we get to huge numbers, like
1,000 or 1 million or 1 trillion, and even

6
00:00:33,155 --> 00:00:38,540
then, we could still keep going. Now, this
special set of numbers has a name, they

7
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:43,420
are called the natural numbers. So the
natural numbers start with one and

8
00:00:43,432 --> 00:00:47,658
increase by ones forever. So now we want
to make sure that you're totally solid on

9
00:00:47,658 --> 00:00:55,562
what falls under this category. Which of
these numbers are natural numbers, 735, 6,

10
00:00:55,562 --> 00:01:03,133
89.1, -1,000, 1/3, and 19? This is a
slightly different kind of than then the

11
00:01:03,133 --> 00:01:07,658
last one. This time I want you to check
off all of the answers that you think are

12
00:01:07,658 --> 00:01:12,114
right. So that might mean checking more
than one, in some cases, you might even

13
00:01:12,114 --> 00:01:14,871
check off all of the answers that are
there.
