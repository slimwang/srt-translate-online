1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,650
All right, we're almost at the end now.

2
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:05,800
Hopefully you've had a lot of fun and
interesting experiences playing around

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:08,210
with Photocraft and
computation at the same time.

4
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:11,350
We've actually had a lot
of interesting lectures.

5
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:13,680
Hopefully you've enjoyed all of
the material we've covered so

6
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,160
far and all of the fun assignments
that you've gone through

7
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,960
to learn about the building blocks
of computational photography.

8
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:22,140
While the lecture part of
this class is over now,

9
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:25,540
I actually do want to say that I'm
going to be now adding on Piazza and

10
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:29,050
other types of sites, a variety
of additional advanced concepts.

11
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:33,390
These will be in forms of research
papers, websites and videos.

12
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:36,070
I do want you to look at all
of this material, study it and

13
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:39,840
engage with me and the rest of the class
in a variety of conversations on what

14
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,970
you think about these advanced concepts.

15
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:45,257
These are concepts that could be
practical to the kinds of things that

16
00:00:45,257 --> 00:00:48,140
you've seen in existing
software packages that you use,

17
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:49,450
to much more researchy,

18
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:54,100
kind of pointing a direction towards
future of computational photography.

19
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:57,170
I'm going to try to come up with
a variety of interesting topics.

20
00:00:57,170 --> 00:00:58,380
Again, my request is,

21
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:02,040
engage with this material on Piazza,
chat with each other.

22
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,976
We're going to have a lot of fun
trying to play around with a variety

23
00:01:04,976 --> 00:01:06,920
of topics in this area.

24
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:10,840
But again, it's new advanced
concepts that I think you'll enjoy.

25
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:14,040
With that, I'd just like to say thank
you, it's been a lot of fun and

26
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,490
remember, have fun
computing with photographs.
