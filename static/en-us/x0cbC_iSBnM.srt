1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:02,740
Hi, I'm with Nier again.

2
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:05,430
In your book,
you talk about manipulation metrics.

3
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:07,050
Could you explain about that?

4
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:07,640
>> Yeah.

5
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:11,590
So, ethics is something
I care about deeply.

6
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:14,610
And, a question I often get is
aren't you teaching people how

7
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:15,820
to make the bomb, right?

8
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:20,420
Aren't you giving people the tools
to use our deeper psychology to

9
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:22,700
manipulate people's
day-to-day behaviors?

10
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:24,260
And the answer is yes.

11
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:28,500
That, in fact, these tools can
be used for nefarious purposes.

12
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,390
The reason I wrote this book was
because I worked in the advertising and

13
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:36,900
gaming industry and I'm trying to bring
these techniques that advertisers and

14
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:39,320
gamers have known for
quite some time, but

15
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,560
to bring these techniques
to the larger community.

16
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:44,970
To help people build products and
services, not just in gaming and

17
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:47,810
advertising, but in health care and
in education and

18
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:52,050
in all sorts of industries where we
can use the power of habits for good.

19
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:55,190
And so that's really why,
the first reason I wrote this book.

20
00:00:55,190 --> 00:01:00,570
But there's still this test that I
give to someone who's concerned,

21
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:04,750
hey how do I make sure that I'm using
these habit-forming techniques?

22
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:07,410
for good.
And so I provide this two-part test

23
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:10,750
in the form of what I call, what you
mentioned, the Manipulation Matrix.

24
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:15,720
The Manipulation Matrix is this
four quadrant matrices where

25
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:20,120
on one axis you have,
do you believe that the product or

26
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:23,880
service that you're working on is
materially improving people's lives?

27
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:24,770
Yes or No.

28
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:27,250
That's the first criteria on the Y axis.

29
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:29,880
Do you believe what you're working on
is materially improving people's lives,

30
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:30,860
yes or no.

31
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:32,540
And only you can answer this question,
right?

32
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:37,110
This isn't a test for you to judge other
people or for other people to judge you.

33
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:38,990
It's sincerely for
this question of, hey,

34
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:42,340
how do I make sure that I'm using
my limited time on earth, right?

35
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:45,250
How do I allocate my human
capital towards something

36
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:47,870
that can serve a higher purpose,
that can do some good in the world.

37
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:49,380
So that's the first question.

38
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:50,770
But that's not good enough.

39
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:53,370
Because there's another question
that I think is critical.

40
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:55,530
Which is, am I the user?

41
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,200
Am I the user?

42
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,280
So there's this two part test.

43
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,180
Now, why do I make people
answer that question?

44
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:01,430
And, that's what's on the X axis.

45
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:04,690
If, yes I'm the user or
no I'm not the user.

46
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:06,740
Do you happen to know the first
rule of drug dealing?

47
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:09,038
>> Never use?

48
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:09,639
>> Close, yeah.

49
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:11,700
Never get high on your own supply,
very good.

50
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,100
I don't want to ask about
your background, but

51
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,230
let's just go with that, right?

52
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:15,130
>> Okay.
>> That's the first rule

53
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:17,400
of drug dealing,
never get high on your own supply.

54
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,000
>> You're right.

55
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,400
>> So, what I'm doing by asking makers
to consider this question of, number

56
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,750
one, do I believe what I'm working on
is materially improving people's lives?

57
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:31,790
And the number two, am I their user
I'm making them break that rule

58
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:36,120
because if there are any negative
effects to overusing this product,

59
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:39,980
if this product is potentially addictive
as opposed to just habit-forming,

60
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:42,610
guess who's going to be
the first person to realize it.

61
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:46,530
So that two part test, I think, puts
you not only in a good moral position

62
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:50,110
because you are the user of the product,
interestingly enough,

63
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:54,420
it actually increases your odds of
success from a business perspective.

64
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:56,260
You become what I call a facilitator.

65
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:58,910
If you can answer in the affirmative
to these two questions,

66
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:00,210
you're a facilitator.

67
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:03,020
And it turns out that the companies
that we talked about earlier,

68
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:06,150
Facebook and Google and
Instagram and WhatsApp and Slack and

69
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:11,070
SnapChat, all of these companies turns
out were started by a facilitator.

70
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:12,710
Doesn't mean you can't make money or

71
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:16,530
have a good business in any of those
other four quadrants, it's just that I

72
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:20,890
think your highest odds of success, and
you're also in a good moral position,

73
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:24,480
if you can answer yes
to those two questions.

74
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,570
>> You probably also feel very
passionate if you're the user, right?

75
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:29,560
>> Right, right, and
you just build better products, right?

76
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:32,740
The advantage of knowing your user,
right?

77
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:34,180
Because, you've got
the user right there,

78
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:37,730
you've got your customer
in you is a huge advantage.

79
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:39,450
And, we don't always
have that opportunity.

80
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:43,590
If you're working at an agency, or
working at a company where maybe it's

81
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:46,340
servicing somebody who is not you,
as the user.

82
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:48,120
We don't always have that luxury.

83
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,490
But then again, we always do.

84
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:51,620
We could always choose what we work on,
and

85
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:53,700
what we're going to spend our time on.

86
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,750
And so
I think that's the best place to be.

87
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:59,860
>> Can you give us an example of
how you can use hooks for good?

88
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:03,210
>> Sure, so a big reason why I wrote
this book is because I want people to

89
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:05,970
use the psychology of
habits to help people live

90
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:07,250
>> better lives, and so

91
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:10,610
I actually do a bit of angel
investing when I see these hooks

92
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:13,820
in products that I think can actually
improve people's well being.

93
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:16,100
So, there's several
companies that come to mind,

94
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:19,130
one company that I'm a big fan
of is called Pantrylabs, and

95
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:23,140
Pantrylabs is trying to take on this
obesity epidemic, and what the,

96
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:28,340
the company founders realized is that
>> People were eating unhealthy food,

97
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:33,340
because let's face it, unhealthy food
is very convenient, it's cheap, and

98
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:34,760
it's delicious.

99
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:39,590
So how do we compete with a vending
machine full of refined sugars that

100
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:43,490
are bad for us, that we know cause
obesity and all kinds of other problems,

101
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:47,070
and that's the entire vending machine So
here comes Pantry lab and says look,

102
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:49,590
we're going to take a refrigerator,
with a door on it.

103
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:53,390
And we're going to attach like a kind of
like an iPad like device to the front

104
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:56,820
and you can open the machine,
the refrigerator whenever you like.

105
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:59,120
But as soon as you take
something out of that machine,

106
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,570
that happens to be stocked
with fresh delivered food.

107
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:05,380
Everyday the food is delivered fresh,
full of salads,

108
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:09,100
full of fresh ingredients that
are very nutritious and healthy for

109
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:14,060
you As soon as you take out
the food from the machine, it has

110
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:18,240
a RFID chip attached to it and your
credit card is automatically charged.

111
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,960
So know for the first time,
healthy food,

112
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:25,460
in an office building is as convenient
to acquire as unhealthy food.

113
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:28,430
And they're really changing people's
lives, their day to day habits,

114
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:32,090
it turns out, That losing weight
doesn't have to be about willpower.

115
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:36,580
It's not your lack of character that
you can't resist these temptations.

116
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:39,680
It's just that if we make the behavior
easier to do, which is a big part of

117
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,640
what I described in the book in
the action phase of the hook.

118
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:46,200
If we make that behavior easier
to do and we build a habit

119
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:49,990
out of eating healthy food by making
it as accessible as unhealthy food.

120
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:51,140
That's all we gotta do, right?

121
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:52,760
We don't have to expend will power.

122
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:55,120
We don't have to do this hard work.

123
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,330
And that's really what's so beautiful
about using habits to change behaviors

124
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:01,530
is that, when we use habits,
we off load the will power.

125
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:03,400
It doesn't have to become
a struggle anymore.

126
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:07,000
It's something that we do day in and day
out with little or no conscious thought.

127
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,750
>> So people will do the right
thing if you make it easier.

128
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,040
>> Right.
Easier, and make it a habit.

129
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,740
Right.
So part of what makes using Pantry Lab

130
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:16,390
so easy is I put in my credit card,
that's the investment phase of the hook.

131
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:18,020
And then I tell it my preferences and so

132
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:20,310
more of that food gets
delivered to me in the future.

133
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:22,700
So this refrigerator that's
just a vending machine,

134
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:26,130
essentially, gets smarter and
smarter over time the more I use it.
