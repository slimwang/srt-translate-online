1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:05,249
Our interval would be from negative 4 to positive 2. x could actually equal

2
00:00:05,249 --> 00:00:10,530
negative 4 and positive 2 in this case, and any value in between them. Great

3
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:14,236
solving if you found this interval. To begin solving this inequality, we

4
00:00:14,236 --> 00:00:18,800
want to subtract 8 from both sides. This allows us to set this quadratic

5
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:24,000
expression less than or equal to 0. Now, we can rewrite this as an equation and

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,780
find the 0s or the x values that make this equal to 0. We factor the quadratic

7
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:33,599
expression, and then we set each factor equal to 0 to get x could equal

8
00:00:33,599 --> 00:00:38,772
negative 4 or x could equal positive 2. We use these to create the three

9
00:00:38,772 --> 00:00:42,740
separate intervals on our number line. Next, we want to test a value in each of

10
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:47,578
the intervals. For the first interval, we'll test the value x equals negative

11
00:00:47,578 --> 00:00:52,116
5. So plugging in the value of negative 5 in for x, we'll get the statement 7

12
00:00:52,116 --> 00:00:57,574
is less than or equal to 0. Now, this of course, isn't true, so this interval

13
00:00:57,574 --> 00:01:02,113
is false. It's not part of our solution. For the second interval, we can test x

14
00:01:02,113 --> 00:01:06,603
equal 0. If x equals 0, we lose these two terms and we're left with negative 8

15
00:01:06,603 --> 00:01:12,190
is less than or equal to 0. This, we know is true, so this part is included in

16
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:16,721
our answer. And finally, for the third interval, if we test x is equal to 3,

17
00:01:16,721 --> 00:01:22,106
we'll get the statement 7 is less than or equal to 0. Again, we know this isn't

18
00:01:22,106 --> 00:01:27,718
true, so this region is out. So the values of x that satisfy our inequality are

19
00:01:27,718 --> 00:01:32,149
between negative 4 and 2. We include negative 4 and 2, since we have the or

20
00:01:32,149 --> 00:01:36,170
equal to symbol here. Since we know both of these values are 0s to the

21
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:40,224
quadratic equation. I hope you're starting to see all sorts of patterns when

22
00:01:40,224 --> 00:01:42,060
you solve these types of problems.
