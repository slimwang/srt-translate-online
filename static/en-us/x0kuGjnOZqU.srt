00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:01,940
Welcome to lesson two.

2
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:07,150
This lesson comes primarily from Udacity
course called Intro to HTML and CSS.

3
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:10,160
When I took this course it was really
helpful for me, because the two

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,260
instructors, Jessica and Cameron, do
a really good job of giving you a really

5
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:19,860
thorough, deep understanding of how the
web works and how HTML is structured.

6
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:23,470
So, as you watch this lesson,
which is taught primarily by Jessica,

7
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:28,540
pay attention to how she really focuses
on the structure of a HTML document and

8
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:30,570
how web browsers
interpret that structure.
