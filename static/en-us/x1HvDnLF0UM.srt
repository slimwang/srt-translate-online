1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:04,670
So now we have some more another trick under our belt that allows us to

2
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:07,770
do this feature matching whether we're doing the or really,

3
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:10,040
in this case, throwing some features away.

4
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:13,990
Match selection, whether we're doing exhaustively hashing or some other method.

5
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:18,640
But remember that distinction we talked about earlier where we said,

6
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:23,970
well, we've got two competing criteria, goals for feature descriptors.

7
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:26,810
We want them to be invariant, that is we don't want them to

8
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:30,580
change very much from one image to the next at the same scene point so

9
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:32,330
that I'll be able to do the match.

10
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:35,550
Which means you want them to sort of, the description to sort of stay the same.

11
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:40,470
But what you don't want is if I've got two similar points in the scene.

12
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:43,040
You want them to have two different descriptors because I

13
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,490
don't want to match to the wrong one.

14
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:46,920
That was this notion of being distinct.

15
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,330
So we have this invariance versus distinctive.

16
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:50,910
And that's the fundamental trade off.

17
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:55,020
And because of that trade off you have this problem that when you

18
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:58,630
pick the best match, because you've done this tradeoff,

19
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:03,120
you are still going to get a bunch of what we'd call wrong matches or outliers.

20
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,270
That is, we have some point matches that actually fit what we want and

21
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:08,950
some of them are just wrong.

22
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:11,320
So the question is, what should we do?

23
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:12,100
All right.

24
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:15,710
So, this sort of lent, launched into the last part of this, and

25
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:19,920
then hopefully, naturally, because I'm such a spectacular teacher into the,

26
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,760
the next lesson, all right.

27
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,030
So, remember, why are we doing this?

28
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:25,640
Well, we're trying to compute a fit,

29
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:29,170
a model that aligns one picture with the other, right.

30
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:33,950
We're going to compute a model that is the relationship between entities.

31
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:39,260
So what we're really doing is model fitting.

32
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:40,030
Okay.

33
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:43,680
Now, remember this picture of model fitting of lines and circles.

34
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,710
Remember when we did that whole Hough transform thing?

35
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:48,390
Where we were saying, Well, we've got a bunch of points and we'd like to

36
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:53,440
find which line is the right line, or which circle is the right circle?

37
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:56,400
Right. And the idea was that some of our edge points come really

38
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:59,630
from the circles, and some of them don't.

39
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:01,820
So really, that's what we're doing here.

40
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:03,110
Is we're doing model fitting.
