00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,600
An advanced pay for performance system
rewards providers who are able to

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:08,400
provide higher quality
care at a lower cost.

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,220
There's evidence that
these programs can work.

4
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:15,690
Here are the results of the Physician
Group Practice, or PGP, demo,

5
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:20,380
a well known Medicare pilot
conducted in ten medical practices.

6
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:24,820
All of the groups achieved improvements
in 25 of 27 quality metrics for

7
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:30,540
the key diseases shown here, and you see
the percentage of improvement as well.

8
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:33,870
Four practices earned a bonus for
outstanding performance.

9
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:38,240
Marshfield Clinic earned
half of the total bonus.

10
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,780
And in explaining how they did it,

11
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:44,750
their CEO cited a well developed
electronic health record and

12
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:49,110
went onto describe how it reduced
unnecessary duplication of services

13
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:53,160
by making information available to all
providers caring for each patient.

14
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:59,230
In fact, Marshfield developed
the EHR system they were using,

15
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:04,110
and in April 2015,
at the largest health IT industry

16
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:08,840
meeting held each year called HIMS,
they introduced a very innovative

17
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:14,190
new version of it that combines the
traditional charting functions of an EHR

18
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:18,350
with fully integrated population health
tools to better manage chronic disease

19
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:21,230
patients like Marla when
they aren't in the office.

20
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:27,340
They also added fully integrated
analytics so that physicians could

21
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:32,160
easily understand the overall quality
of care being delivered by them to all

22
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:37,120
their patients and
a fully integrated patient portal so

23
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:40,790
that Marla could engage with
her physicians in her care.
