1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,080
So here's an image of an old and I think now expired comedian who's,

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:07,130
therefore, cannot sue me.

3
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:10,490
That's Phyllis Diller, by the way, in case you remember.

4
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:12,820
And by the way, we're going to start with black and white because black and

5
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:15,950
white just makes everything easier because it's just a single channel.

6
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:20,010
We, we'll do color on and off, but pretty much everything we do for black and

7
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:24,070
white do, you do for color, hold for black and white, and, and it's just easier.

8
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:26,930
So when I show this to you, you actually think of it as a picture or

9
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:28,200
something to look at.

10
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,770
But what actually is, is a function.

11
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:34,442
In fact, we can just call it a function of I of x y,

12
00:00:34,442 --> 00:00:40,880
all right, where the I has something to do with the image intensity.

13
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:45,425
So, if I think of this as a function, then I can just plop this as a surface and

14
00:00:45,425 --> 00:00:48,350
MATLAB makes this incredibly easy.

15
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:50,970
And if I did, it would look something like this.

16
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:51,760
Okay?

17
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,450
Now this is the exact same function, but

18
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:58,020
instead of showing you as a picture where, you know, sort of straight on, and

19
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:00,240
by the way, the way MATLAB does it it's really cool, the,

20
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:04,290
the higher the thing is it also makes it brighter, so you can see.

21
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:05,530
So if you take a look at like the,

22
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:09,310
the, the checkers pattern on that awful shirt she was wearing, right, so

23
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:12,890
the bright spots are here, and the dark spots are down there.

24
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:17,560
Okay, that function is the same function as the image that I

25
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,420
was showing you before.

26
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:22,280
Computer vision and especially image processing, we'll be

27
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:26,020
talking mostly about the image processing side of computer vision today and

28
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:32,450
the next few are about taking these functions and computing something from them.

29
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:36,730
Often, we're just going to computer another image-like function, so images in,

30
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:38,280
images out.

31
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:42,290
And sometimes, we'll be getting some sorts of information.

32
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:43,820
So here's a very simple example.

33
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:47,880
Suppose I took that previous function, and I just smoothed it.

34
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:51,700
All right, so now you see, I have the same surface I had before, but

35
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:55,118
it's now, you know, it blends smoother, and the peaks and

36
00:01:55,118 --> 00:01:58,290
the valleys of that shirt are, are much smoother.

37
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:00,600
They're not as steep as they were before.

38
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,430
Okay.

39
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:02,930
So that’s the function.

40
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:06,390
Now, of course, I can show that to you as an image again.

41
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:07,320
What’s that going to look like?

42
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:10,000
Well, you’ve probably figured this out because you’re all so smart.

43
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,930
It’s just going to be a blurry version of that image, okay.

44
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:18,110
And I’m showing it here side by side with the blurred function, oh, sorry,

45
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:20,840
the smooth function, right?

46
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,650
Because there is this direct analogy between what we call blurring in

47
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:27,230
the image and smoothing of that function.

48
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:28,530
It's exactly the same thing.
