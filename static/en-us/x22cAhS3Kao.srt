Hello and welcome to Project 1.5
of the iOS Developer Nanodegree.

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:10,370
I say project because everything that
follows here is completely optional.

3
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:13,350
What we're doing is trying to
give you the opportunity to start

4
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:16,129
thinking about your
final portfolio project

5
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:20,660
where you'll build an app of your own
creation completely from the ground up.

6
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:25,120
Now you might be thinking, hey,
I'm totally not ready for that.

7
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:26,030
I just got here.

8
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:29,470
I just did a course in Xcode and
I don't know what I might want to build.

9
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:31,140
And that's totally fine.

10
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,710
All of the content will
be repeated in the final

11
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:36,740
course which shows you how to
build an app from scratch.

12
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:39,530
But if you want to get started now,
we'll give you some tips and

13
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:41,810
tricks on how to brainstorm
an awesome idea.
