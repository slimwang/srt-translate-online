1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,492
The complex conjugate of 1 plus 9 I is just 1 minus 9 I. Now let's find their

2
00:00:04,492 --> 00:00:09,282
product. Having a bunch of 1's in here actually makes our multiplication pretty

3
00:00:09,282 --> 00:00:13,818
easy. I like that. Now you just need to simplify this final term and combine

4
00:00:13,818 --> 00:00:18,673
like terms. Notice already we can see these 2 terms, negative 9 I and positive 9

5
00:00:18,673 --> 00:00:22,964
I. Cancel one another out just like we had happen with our previous conjugate

6
00:00:22,964 --> 00:00:27,465
pair multiplied together. I would like to pause at this step for a second where

7
00:00:27,465 --> 00:00:31,697
we have 1 minus 81 i squared and note that this is a difference of 2 squares.

8
00:00:31,697 --> 00:00:36,125
This is actually what we would expect to get when we are multiplying things like

9
00:00:36,125 --> 00:00:40,587
this together. Remember that we learned quite early on in the course that when

10
00:00:40,587 --> 00:00:45,147
we multiply something in the form a plus b times a minus b. We get a squared

11
00:00:45,147 --> 00:00:50,619
minus b squared. This is exactly what's happening here. 1 is equal to 1 times 1

12
00:00:50,619 --> 00:00:55,845
or a squared, and 81i squared is equal to 9i, the quantity squared. Now of

13
00:00:55,845 --> 00:01:01,805
course, we can simplify 81i squared because this is just a real number. Number.

14
00:01:01,805 --> 00:01:08,434
I squared is just negative 1. And negative 81 times negative 1 is positive 81,

15
00:01:08,434 --> 00:01:10,134
so our answer is 82.
