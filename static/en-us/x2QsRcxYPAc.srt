Two lines that are perpendicular to one another have different slopes. And not

00:00:04,388 --> 00:00:08,766
only that, but these slopes are different in a very special way. They also form

3
00:00:08,778 --> 00:00:12,912
a right angle with one another, as you can see that these two lines do right

00:00:12,924 --> 00:00:17,449
here. And lastly, they have opposite signs. For example, this light blue line in

5
00:00:17,461 --> 00:00:21,804
our graph has a negative slope. And this one has a positive slope. We'll talk

00:00:21,816 --> 00:00:26,382
more about these specific characteristics of perpendicular lines in the coming
