00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:01,060
Welcome back!

2
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:04,734
What you just got was 88.4% correct for naive base.

3
00:00:04,734 --> 00:00:05,460
>> 88.4.

4
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:06,220
Awesome guys.

5
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:07,420
>> Well, does that mean that your,

6
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:09,480
your self-driving car only crashed 11.6% of the time?

7
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:12,710
>> It'll crash occasionally yeah.

8
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:14,060
It's not good enough for cars.

9
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:15,690
>> Okay. >> But it's great for this course.

10
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:16,230
>> It is very good.

11
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:17,870
It's much better than guessing.

12
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:19,430
One of the things that you did in that example,

13
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:21,870
maybe you didn't even realized you were doing it was you trained and

14
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:23,790
you tested on two different sets of data.

15
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:27,450
>> And that's actually really important in machine learning we always train and

16
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:28,720
test on different data.

17
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:31,730
>> If you don't do that what can happen is that you can over fit to your

18
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:32,299
training data.

19
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:35,890
You can think that you know better what's going on than, than you actually know.

20
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:38,308
>> That's really important because in machine learning you have to kind of

21
00:00:38,308 --> 00:00:40,668
generaliz to new data that's somewhat different.

22
00:00:40,668 --> 00:00:43,280
An algorithm would just memorize all the data,

23
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,540
test it on the same data as training data, which will always give you 100%.

24
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:49,210
But it had no clue how to generalize to new data.

25
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:50,560
>> That's right. So what you should always do,

26
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,590
and what we'll always do in this course,

27
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:55,940
is you should save maybe 10% of your data and you use it as your testing set.

28
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:58,540
And that's what you use to actually tell you how much progress you're

29
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:00,740
making in terms of learning your patterns in your data.

30
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:04,739
>> So, when you report the results to yourself and, and, and to your boss or

31
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:08,400
your client, use the tested result, because it's a much better,

32
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,020
fair kind of understanding of how they are doing when you train them.
