00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,899
In this lesson, you'll get to build
an app that helps restaurants organize

2
00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:06,410
their wait lists for
guests as they show up.

3
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:09,009
With the app, the waiter can
add new guests to the wait list

4
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:13,210
as they walk in by typing in their name
and the number of guests in the party.

5
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:16,719
Once added, the name and the party
size will appear in the list below

6
00:00:16,719 --> 00:00:18,979
in the order that they have been added.

7
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:22,420
And when it's time to seat that group,
they can be simply swiped off the list.

8
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:26,630
We will be storing this guest
list into an SQLite database

9
00:00:26,629 --> 00:00:28,640
by adding new guests as they show up and

10
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,250
removing guests from the database
by swiping them off the list.

11
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,439
So that if the app was
killed at any time,

12
00:00:34,439 --> 00:00:37,149
we certainly don't want to lose
that precious list of guests.

13
00:00:37,149 --> 00:00:41,589
As we've done with earlier toy apps, we
will building this step by step as well.

14
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:43,770
Each exercise completes
an important part and

15
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:46,680
you will be gradually building
up the app to its final stage.

16
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:49,710
The first step is to create a special
class known as the contract that will

17
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:53,730
define the structure of our database and
how the rest of the application sees it.

18
00:00:53,729 --> 00:00:57,832
Then we'll create the actual database,
specifying the table schema and

19
00:00:57,832 --> 00:01:00,826
the data types of each of
the columns in the database.

20
00:01:00,826 --> 00:01:02,722
Once we get the database up and running,

21
00:01:02,722 --> 00:01:06,477
we will get to write queries to retrieve
all the records stored in the database.

22
00:01:06,477 --> 00:01:10,174
And then the following step is to modify
the adapter in the RecyclerView to

23
00:01:10,174 --> 00:01:13,465
display the list of guests that
was retrieved from the database.

24
00:01:13,465 --> 00:01:18,005
And then finally, we will get to write
some slightly more complicated queries

25
00:01:18,004 --> 00:01:20,439
to add and
remove guests in the database.

26
00:01:20,439 --> 00:01:20,810
Ready?

27
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:21,980
Well, let's get started.
