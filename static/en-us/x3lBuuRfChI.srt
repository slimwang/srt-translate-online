00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,617
So having one box that we've made, or one model building that we've made is

2
00:00:03,617 --> 00:00:08,665
great, but I chose a certain size that I wanted these squares to be. So I'm

3
00:00:08,665 --> 00:00:12,810
wondering what's going to happen if I choose a different sized square. Let's

4
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:17,288
see. Maybe to start out my experiment, I'll make a rectangle that has little

5
00:00:17,288 --> 00:00:21,281
tiny, tiny, tiny squares cut out of the corners.

00:00:21,281 --> 00:00:23,790
[BLANK_AUDIO].

7
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:30,213
So now that I have my tiny squares cut out, I'm going to cut out some really

8
00:00:30,213 --> 00:00:36,686
big ones. Actually, I'm going to consider, first of all, this box as our

9
00:00:36,686 --> 00:00:42,319
medium-sized corner box. And for comparison, I'm just going to take that tape

10
00:00:42,319 --> 00:00:43,870
off of it.

11
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:48,706
[BLANK_AUDIO]

12
00:00:48,706 --> 00:00:54,598
. So medium one is back. Now for the really big one, or rather the really big

13
00:00:54,598 --> 00:00:56,135
corners.

14
00:00:56,135 --> 00:00:56,453
[BLANK_AUDIO].

15
00:00:56,453 --> 00:01:01,317
So now, we have three very different looking rectangles with the corners cut

16
00:01:01,317 --> 00:01:06,812
out of them. And the question I have for you and something that Athena's

17
00:01:06,812 --> 00:01:11,420
wondering is which one of these has the biggest volume when it's folded into a

18
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:18,230
box? Or in other words, which one's going to hold the most M&amp;M's? Clearly we

19
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:22,490
want the box that's going to hold the most M &amp; M's. So pick between these three

20
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:23,530
boxes.
