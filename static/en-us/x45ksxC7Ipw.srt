00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,659
Operating a CDN presents many different challenges. And

2
00:00:03,659 --> 00:00:07,676
the underlying goal is to replicate content on

3
00:00:07,676 --> 00:00:11,280
many servers. So that the content is replicated

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,990
close to the clients. Yet this leaves many open

5
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:17,210
questions. Including how to replicate the content. Where

6
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:19,500
it should be replicated, how clients should find

7
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,710
the replicated content, how to choose the appropriate

8
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:25,940
server replica, or cache, for a particular client, and

9
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:29,850
how to direct clients towards the appropriate replica once it's

10
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:34,220
selected. This problem is commonly known as server selection, and this

11
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:37,120
problem is sometimes called content routing. Let's take a look

12
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,370
at each of these problems in a little bit more detail.
