1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:01,830
All right, so after that research,

2
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:05,620
we now know how to set a click listener
onto a list item in the list view.

3
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:08,660
>> Yeah, and going back to our
boxes we have this ListView object

4
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:10,540
which contains our list item views.

5
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:13,600
And we can call
the setOnItemClickListener method and

6
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:15,106
pass in a listener object.

7
00:00:15,106 --> 00:00:19,970
>> And this on item ClickListener object
has a method called onItemClick, and

8
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:21,770
it can contain any
instructions that we want.

9
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:25,350
So things like popping up a toast
message, or even play an audio file.

10
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:27,020
>> Okay.
That makes sense.

11
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:29,870
And we're going to be hand-holding
the student less, right?

12
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:31,370
>> But I like holding hands.

13
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:32,210
>> Jessica.

14
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:32,860
>> All right, it's okay, it's okay.

15
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:36,010
Even though this next coding
exercise has multiple steps,

16
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:37,560
I'm confident the student can handle it.

17
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:38,640
>> See, that's the spirit.

18
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:42,080
>> So for this next task,
I want you to modify the app so

19
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:44,510
that clicking on a list
item plays an audio file.

20
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:45,910
>> You can do it.

21
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:49,120
>> Earlier we decided we would start off
by making it work for a single audio

22
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:53,390
file and then switch over to
the correct audio files for each word.

23
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:58,270
So I want to provide you with one audio
file for the number word one, lutti.

24
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:01,790
So check the notes below the quiz
to download that MP3 file and

25
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:04,650
only be modifying the numbers
activity right now.

26
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:06,480
So this is what you app should
look like when you're done.

27
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:10,438
Clicking on any list item should
play the same word, lutti.

28
00:01:10,438 --> 00:01:12,410
>> Lutti.

29
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:15,200
>> When you're done with this task,
go ahead and check this check box.
