Before we dive into auto layout,

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:06,550
there's one very important question
that we have to answer first.

3
00:00:06,549 --> 00:00:08,150
Why do we need it at all?

4
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:11,679
Whenever creating a UI,
there are two things to keep in mind.

5
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:13,320
Laying out the views, and

6
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:18,050
deciding how these views will adapt
when the available screen size changes.

7
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:20,130
Let's take a closer look
at each of these steps.
