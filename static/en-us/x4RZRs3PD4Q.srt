00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:04,051
I'm going to start this lesson by noting that tessellate is the most misspelled

2
00:00:04,051 --> 00:00:07,560
word in computer graphics. So give it a good look and think of doubling every

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:11,466
letter that you can when you spell it. Yes, 2 Ls looks weird to me too, but

4
00:00:11,466 --> 00:00:16,094
that's how it works, and I force myself to spell it correctly. The word,

5
00:00:16,094 --> 00:00:19,937
tessellate is from the Greek word Tessella, which means a small stone in a

6
00:00:19,937 --> 00:00:24,635
mosaic. In English, breaking an object into polygons of any sort is called

7
00:00:24,635 --> 00:00:29,114
tessellation. In computer graphics, a curved surface is often represented by

8
00:00:29,114 --> 00:00:33,521
triangles by placing points on surface and connecting these together. For

9
00:00:33,521 --> 00:00:37,943
example, a geodesic dome is 1 tessellation of a sphere, such as the biosphere in

10
00:00:37,943 --> 00:00:42,620
Montral. When it comes to making surfaces the GPU understands only triangles. To

11
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:47,924
draw any polygon, we break that polygon into a set of triangles. This process is

12
00:00:47,924 --> 00:00:51,694
naturally called triangulation, usually we use the existing vertices as the

13
00:00:51,694 --> 00:00:56,681
polygon when performing triangulation. The major rule is that when we add an

14
00:00:56,681 --> 00:01:01,334
edge, it has to be entirely inside the polygon. Triangulation is a particular

15
00:01:01,334 --> 00:01:05,990
form of tessellation. Here's the same pentagon tessellated in a fairly arbitrary

16
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:10,820
way, with new vertices added inside the pentagon and connected together. Once

17
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:14,505
upon a time some older graphics hardware from the 1980's supported objects such

18
00:01:14,505 --> 00:01:18,886
as polygons or even more complex objects. For example Nvidia's first chip, the

19
00:01:18,886 --> 00:01:23,663
nv1 supported ellipsoids as a basic primitive. Graphics hardware manufacturers

20
00:01:23,663 --> 00:01:27,311
quickly came to realize that the triangle is a fine building block for almost

21
00:01:27,311 --> 00:01:31,550
everything we want to draw. For example one problem with a quadrilateral is that

22
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:35,016
the surface is poorly defined if all four points are not in the same plane. A

23
00:01:35,016 --> 00:01:39,438
triangle's three points are by definition always in the same plane and, so, have

24
00:01:39,438 --> 00:01:44,300
no such problems. By the way the graphics coprocessor I used to develop on in

25
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:50,051
the late 1980's cost about $35,000 at the time. It was perhaps at best 1-1

26
00:01:50,051 --> 00:01:55,784
millionth as fast as the fastest GPU's are nowadays, at only at the price of a

27
00:01:55,784 --> 00:01:56,203
BMW.
