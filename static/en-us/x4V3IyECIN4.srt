00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:03,300
Now, you may have noticed some peaks in May or perhaps

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:06,840
in October, but I think what's really interesting is this huge spike

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:11,140
on January first. There's almost 4,000 users in this bin. Now, this

4
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:14,740
could be because of the default settings that Facebook uses or perhaps

5
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:17,380
users are choosing the first choice in the drop down menus.

6
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:20,100
Another idea is that some users may want to protect their privacy

7
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:23,090
and so they just go with January first by default. Whatever the

8
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:26,230
case may be, I think it's important that we make our considerations

9
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:30,130
in the context of our data. We want to look out for these types of anomalies.
