00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,370
Greetings, salutations, and
welcome to the next lesson.

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:07,920
Let's talk about a very important topic
in software development, testing.

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:10,470
>> Automated testing can
bring many benefits.

4
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:14,230
It provides a safety net by
allowing developers to experiment,

5
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:16,940
add new features, and
improving existing ones,

6
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:19,730
without being afraid that that
will break existing functionality.

7
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:25,590
Automated testing helps catch more
bugs by streamlining repetitive tests.

8
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:29,010
Therefore, giving testers time to
spend improving the testing suite

9
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:31,540
as opposed to manually
performing the same actions.

10
00:00:32,564 --> 00:00:35,485
Proper testing is even more
important when using continuous

11
00:00:35,485 --> 00:00:37,185
integration and delivery.

12
00:00:37,185 --> 00:00:40,695
>> Now depending on what your background
is and what you do day to day,

13
00:00:40,695 --> 00:00:43,865
you might not be familiar with all the
different types of tests that can and

14
00:00:43,865 --> 00:00:45,280
should be performed.

15
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,414
You might feel as if you're starting
from zero knowledge about testing.

16
00:00:48,414 --> 00:00:51,340
But no matter what your background is,
if you have written and

17
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:54,360
run some piece of code,
it means you've tested it.

18
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:58,320
>> Also, what if I've literally
never written any tests?

19
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,960
>> Well,
in a way everyone tests a program

20
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,790
every single time they try to run it.

21
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:05,700
The test is, does this thing even run?

22
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,580
But of course that is not enough.

23
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:09,820
You also want to know,
does it run correctly?

24
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:13,250
Does it work under different
conditions and with different inputs?

25
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:15,980
Does it work fast enough,
and is it secure?

26
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:17,790
If it fails does it fail gracefully?

27
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:19,760
>> Right, and

28
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:23,177
you want to know all these answers very
soon after you've pushed your code to

29
00:01:23,177 --> 00:01:27,000
the repository, not after it's been
deployed to a production system.

30
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,630
>> Right, so let's agree that
tests are pretty important, but

31
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:32,350
who should be writing these tests?

32
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:37,390
Developers, testers, operations,
security, product owners?

33
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:39,130
>> Maybe all of them.

34
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:40,300
Let's get into more details.
