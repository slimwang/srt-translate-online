1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,390
So the way that we deal with this problem
is actually exactly like we did when we

2
00:00:04,402 --> 00:00:08,170
were doing 10-(2+3), but this time we
can't change what's inside the

3
00:00:08,182 --> 00:00:12,671
parenthesis. There's no way that we know
of to simplify x+9, since these are not

4
00:00:12,683 --> 00:00:16,939
like terms. So that means, that we can't
go about doing things with the first

5
00:00:16,951 --> 00:00:21,379
method of PEMDAS, or at least the p here
doesn't affect the way that we can do the

6
00:00:21,391 --> 00:00:26,246
problem, since we can't change what's
inside the parenthesis. So, that means

7
00:00:26,258 --> 00:00:31,152
we're stuck with this second method.
Remember down here that meant applying the

8
00:00:31,164 --> 00:00:36,022
negative sign to both the 2 and the 3 so
we ended up subtracting each of them from

9
00:00:36,034 --> 00:00:40,831
the 10. So let's try to do the same thing
up here. We want to subtract both the X

10
00:00:40,843 --> 00:00:46,455
and also the 9 so we'll have 4 minus X and
then also minus 9. Rearrange and then

11
00:00:46,467 --> 00:00:53,050
combine like terms 4-9 is -5-x so we have
our final answer of -5-x.
