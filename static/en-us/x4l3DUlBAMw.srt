00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:03,280
Okay, after playing with
five by five isolation for

2
00:00:03,279 --> 00:00:06,369
a bit, the average branching
factor seems to be about eight.

3
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:10,500
So we now we get an estimate
of eight to the 25th nodes.

4
00:00:11,789 --> 00:00:14,344
>> That's about ten to the 22nd nodes.

5
00:00:14,345 --> 00:00:17,344
>> Great.
That means that we only have to wait for

6
00:00:17,344 --> 00:00:20,604
around 1.2 million years
to get our answer.

7
00:00:20,605 --> 00:00:22,254
>> Yeah.
You're not going to be alive by then.

8
00:00:22,254 --> 00:00:24,308
>> Them dang kids.

9
00:00:24,309 --> 00:00:25,920
No good.

10
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:26,910
>> Thanks.

11
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:28,100
>> No problem.

12
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:31,620
>> Okay that means we need to be more
clever about how we make a computer

13
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:33,210
player for isolation.

14
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:36,740
The exponential growth of the game tree
means we can't brute force the problem

15
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:38,840
and search to the end game easily.

16
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:42,189
In general more interesting games
will not be searchable to the end.

17
00:00:42,189 --> 00:00:45,250
Either the branching factor
is too large or the depth or

18
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:49,310
both, when the number of nodes which
we can estimate by branching factor to

19
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:52,270
the depth power starts becoming
comparable to the number of

20
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:55,510
seconds remaining in the life of
the universe, we know we are in trouble.
