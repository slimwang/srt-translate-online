1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,620
Let us look at the meaning of the sentence, Ashok ate a frog.

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:08,780
When I say the sentence, you understand its meaning immediately. But

3
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:14,150
what did you understand? What is the meaning, of the meaning, of the sentence?

4
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:19,460
How can I capture that meaning? How we capture it in a machine? Let us focus for

5
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:25,600
now, on the verb in the sentence, which is ate. We'll associate a frame.

6
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,980
With the verb in the sentence. Later on we will see that frames can

7
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:34,040
also be associated with the objects or the nouns in the sentence, but for

8
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:37,622
now we will focus on the verb. Now what is it that we know about

9
00:00:37,622 --> 00:00:42,170
the stereotypical action of eating? What happens when people eat, when you and

10
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:47,420
I eat? Usually there is an agent, that does the eating. And that particular

11
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:51,650
agent that corresponded the subject of the sentence. Usually something is being

12
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:55,911
eaten, that's the object. There is often a location where the eating is done or

13
00:00:55,911 --> 00:00:59,960
the time when the eating is being done. Someone might use a, utensil to

14
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:04,269
do the eating. You might eat with a fork or a spoon for example. There might be

15
00:01:04,269 --> 00:01:09,250
other things that we know about the stereotypical action of eating. For example,

16
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:15,290
what is being eaten typically is not alive. At least not when humans eat it.

17
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:20,620
Now this vertical slot object-is, this concerns the location of the object.

18
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:24,120
Where is the object after it has been eaten? And you might say well,

19
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:28,280
it's inside the subject's body. What might be the mood of the subject? Well,

20
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:31,910
after people have eaten, typically they are happier. So, here is

21
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:35,760
a list of slots that we associate with the stereotypical action of eating.

22
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:41,140
This is not an exhaustive list, you can add some more. So each of the slots may

23
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:46,500
take some values. We'll call these values fillers. So slots and

24
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:52,221
fillers. Some of the fillers are here by default.

25
00:01:52,221 --> 00:01:56,050
Some of the fillers may come from. Parsing the sentence. So, we know that

26
00:01:56,050 --> 00:02:00,750
in this particular sentence, the subject is Ashok and the object is a frog.

27
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:07,730
Okay so, frame then, is a knowledge structure. Note the word structure.

28
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:11,560
There are, a number of things happening in this knowledge representation.

29
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:16,050
If I may take an analogy with something, with which I'm sure you are familiar.

30
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:19,480
Consider the difference between an atom of knowledge representation, and

31
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:24,190
a molecule of knowledge representation. Some knowledge representations are like

32
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:28,050
atoms, other knowledge representations are like molecules.

33
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:32,670
An atom is a unit by itself, a production rule is like an atom.

34
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:38,000
On the other hand, frames are like molecules, they have a structure.

35
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,979
There are a large number of things happening. These molecules could expand or

36
00:02:41,979 --> 00:02:46,100
could contract. You can do a lot more with frames, that you can do with a simple

37
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:51,450
production rule. So frame isn't like a knowledge structure, which has slots, and

38
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:56,160
which has fillers that go with it. Some of these fillers, are by default.

39
00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:01,440
A frame deals with the stereotypical situation. Consider now a different

40
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:06,350
sentence. Suppose we had the sentence, David ate a pizza at home. Now here,

41
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:09,690
I have filled out what a frame for this particular sentence would look like.

42
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:12,630
The subject is different, the object is different. This time,

43
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:15,780
there is some information about location, in the previous sentence there was no

44
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:19,840
information about location. Let us compare these two frames for another second.

45
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:25,240
Note that these slots. In case of both the frames are exactly the same, because

46
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:30,230
the frame corresponds to the action of eating. The fillers on the other hand

47
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:33,396
are different, at least some of the fillers are different, because these fillers

48
00:03:33,396 --> 00:03:39,090
corresponded the various input sentences. The only fillers that are the same,

49
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:42,670
are those fillers which have to do with default values for particular slots.
