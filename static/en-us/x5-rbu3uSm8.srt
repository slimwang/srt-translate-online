If you correctly implemented
the escape parameters method then

2
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:05,830
you should have returned some
variation of this string.

3
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:10,370
And the reason I'm saying variation
is because the parameter name value

4
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:13,120
pairs could show up
in a different order.

5
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,055
Right now, the quiz parameter is
the first one to show up in this

6
00:00:16,055 --> 00:00:17,245
particular answer.

7
00:00:17,245 --> 00:00:20,175
But because we can't be sure
how escape parameters is going

8
00:00:20,175 --> 00:00:22,755
to iterate through
the dictionary of parameters,

9
00:00:22,755 --> 00:00:26,215
the parameter name value pairs could
show up in any particular order.
