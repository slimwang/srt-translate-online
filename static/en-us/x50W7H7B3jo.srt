1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:04,050
Let's recall some basic facts
about this type architecture.

2
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:06,260
Assuming perfect overlap
of computation and

3
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:10,120
data movement, you can estimate
the maximum normalized performance.

4
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:13,230
It's this expression,
which I've denoted by Rmax.

5
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:15,530
Rmax is defined in terms of W star,

6
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:18,580
which is the work of the best
sequential algorithm.

7
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:21,250
It also depends on the work
of your algorithm, W.

8
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:25,180
It depends on the works
overall intensity, I.

9
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:28,570
And finally, it depends on
the machine's balance point B.

10
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:32,259
In performance analysis, one way to
visualize the relationships among these

11
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:35,760
parameters is through something
called a roof line plot.

12
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,270
Start with a pair of x,y axes.

13
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:40,200
It's usually drawn as a long log plot,
but

14
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,350
let's ignore that fact for the moment.

15
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:44,518
On the x axis, you plot intensity.

16
00:00:44,518 --> 00:00:48,620
On the y-axis,
you would plot normalized performance.

17
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:50,930
For this problem,
let's assume that W star and

18
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:54,420
W remain fixed, but I might vary.

19
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:57,230
This would happen if you had,
say, a bunch of algorithms or

20
00:00:57,230 --> 00:01:00,000
a bunch of implementations that
all did the same amount of work,

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,090
but varied the communication.

22
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:05,319
The curve you would get if you plotted R
max as a function of I would look like

23
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:06,440
the following.

24
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:09,760
Because of it's shape it's
sometimes called a roofline plot.

25
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,500
So what do you see?

26
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:16,235
Well the plot has a linearly increasing
slope followed by an inflection point,

27
00:01:16,235 --> 00:01:17,955
followed by a plateau.

28
00:01:17,955 --> 00:01:21,035
The interesting features
are the value of the plateau and

29
00:01:21,035 --> 00:01:23,105
the location of the inflection point.

30
00:01:23,105 --> 00:01:26,135
Let's call these Y0 and X0 respectively.

31
00:01:26,135 --> 00:01:27,657
Here's my question.

32
00:01:27,657 --> 00:01:29,777
What are the values of X0 and Y0?

33
00:01:29,777 --> 00:01:34,797
Express your answer in terms of i,
b, w, and w_star.

34
00:01:34,797 --> 00:01:39,464
And when you type out w_star,
use the notation w_star.
