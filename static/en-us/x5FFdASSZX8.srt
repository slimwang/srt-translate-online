00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
To make another case for explicit debugging,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
let me illustrate this with a game of Mastermind.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
You know Mastermind, don't you?

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Your opponent has 4 pins hidden behind a board,

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
and your job is to guess the colors of these pins.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
So you come up with 1 trial, and you get points

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
for every color that's in the right position,

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
and for every color that's correct but not in the right position.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
This is what your opponent tells you.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
And so, you make 1 attempt after the other,

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
until after normally 7 or 8 attempts or so,

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
you finally guess the right combination.

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Mastermind is a prime example of applying the scientific method:

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
coming up with 1 experiment after the other

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
to validate or reject a hypothesis on what's behind these bars,

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
and then based on your observations, you come up with a new hypothesis and a new hypothesis.

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
You literally refine your hypothesis until you find the answer.

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Now, when you're playing Mastermind,

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
you always record what you tried before and what the result was.

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
This is the same as explicit debugging.

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
You write down what you do and what the result was.

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
And this is what makes you effective.

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Not writing down what you do is like playing Mastermind with a blindfold,

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
trying to remember all the combinations and all the results.

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Sure, you can do that.

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
You're a great thinker.

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
You're a smart person.

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
You could probably also play Mastermind blind.

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
But why do that, if you can simply look at what you already did,

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
interrupt the session at any time, and resume later at wish?

31
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Think about your significant other and remove your blindfold.
