00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:05,270
Okay, so now that we've been able to play sound at a really slow rate,

2
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:07,440
here is your next challenge.

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,900
You should add a new button to the scene and

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:12,646
change its image to look like that of a rabbit.

5
00:00:15,825 --> 00:00:20,260
By the way, this image is available for you to use in the instructor notes.

6
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:23,060
You should also add constraints to this button so

7
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:25,480
it shows up in the top right hand corner of your phone.

8
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:28,930
Once you're done with this, you can create an action for

9
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:32,430
this button and play the movie quote at a really fast speed.

10
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:35,850
To complete this user interface,

11
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:39,390
you can add a stop button at the bottom of the screen.

12
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:41,839
This button should stop any audio from playing.

13
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:44,770
All of this should take you a while to do.

14
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:49,410
But by now you have the necessary skills to accomplish all of this.

15
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:51,710
Here are all the challenges one more time.

16
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:53,060
Check this box when you are done.
