1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
We also learned about planning--in particular, breadth-first planning,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
A-star planning, and dynamic programming planning

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
that all address slightly different use cases.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Those are being used to plan the trajectory of the Google Street-View car

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
and the Darpa Grand Challenge cars.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
In fact, you implemented a good number of those, which is quite amazing.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Here is my quiz for planning.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
You learned about breadth first, A-star, dynamic programming,

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
and for the sake of this comparison I will also include the smoother,

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
which is more like plan refinement.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Check any or all of those boxes if the corresponding planner

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
acts in a continuous space, if it finds an optimal solution,

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
if it's a universal plan--

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
that means the solution, once found, can be applied to arbitrary states--

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
or if the solution is local, which means given an approximate initial solution,

16
00:00:56,000 --> 99:59:59,999
it cannot really do anything more than just locally refine the solution.
