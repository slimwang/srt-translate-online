00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,150
I have asked you to have a look at, at Harel's original paper. In there,

2
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:10,030
he has several abstract diagrams laying out the various features of the state

3
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:16,430
chart notation. On the left, there is a a state machine that has three states.

4
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:20,510
Notice the default state is the top one and,

5
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:26,500
with the line coming into it, and there are transitions among the states.

6
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:30,590
Totally, there are six transitions there.

7
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:36,340
The version on the right labeled b, okay, is a nested state transition diagram.

8
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:41,980
A new state called D in the roundtangle, surrounds states A and B.

9
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:49,160
A is still the default state for the the state machine as a whole.

10
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:54,620
But notice that some of the lines come out of D

11
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:59,450
rather than coming out of either A or C. Going back to the one on the left,

12
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:02,980
notice there are two transitions labeled f, one coming out from A and

13
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:07,020
going to B, one coming out of C and going to B. On the right,

14
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:12,850
they're coming out of D. That is, there's there's a an abstraction,

15
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:18,910
saying when you leave any state in D under transition f,

16
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:23,394
you go to B. So in that case, we reduce two transitions labeled f to one.

17
00:01:23,394 --> 00:01:26,976
There's still the transition from A to C.

18
00:01:26,976 --> 00:01:32,080
There's still the transition from B to A.

19
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:37,760
Notice also though that there's a transition from B to D labeled h.

20
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:43,450
In this case, where does it go? Well, notice that we've added a new

21
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:49,140
default state and its transition for C. That is,

22
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:54,680
if a transition comes into D, to the border of D,

23
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:57,200
where is it going to go? It's going to go to the default state, which is C.

24
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,120
Well, this is identical to what's happening on the left where there's

25
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:04,870
a direct line from B to C. In this case the line's a little shorter, saving just

26
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:09,440
a little bit of complexity. We could also have the nesting go further.

27
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,610
That is A or C or B could themselves have substate machines in them
