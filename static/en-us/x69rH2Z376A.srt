Let's finally get back to helping Athena. She knows that she wants to build her

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:09,466
glasses frame logo using the shape of y equals x to the 4th. However, she wants

3
00:00:09,466 --> 00:00:13,852
the center of her glasses frame to be at the origin. So, she's figured out she

4
00:00:13,852 --> 00:00:17,634
needs to move this function to the right and down one, to create the bottom

5
00:00:17,634 --> 00:00:23,544
half of the right side of the frame. That should give her this graph. So this

6
00:00:23,544 --> 00:00:26,892
area right here will be the bottom of the right side of the frame, however we

7
00:00:26,892 --> 00:00:32,152
need the equation of this function. Please write the right-hand side of the

8
00:00:32,152 --> 00:00:36,399
equation here, I've already given you the left-hand side, it's just y.
