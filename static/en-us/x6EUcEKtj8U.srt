00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,660
Okay, so not a very big change there.

2
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:04,510
But if you deploy this, wait for

3
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:09,460
it to deploy, then go to your app and
add a filter, hit Search, and it works.

4
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:12,550
Now, if you happen to notice
that a particular filter or

5
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:16,610
combination of filters yields an error,
well take a look in your logs, and

6
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:19,920
you might see something familiar
from a previous part of the lesson.

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,960
And you can fix that in the way
that we discussed earlier.
