1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:04,580
But before we go to raid let's
see if we understood what codes,

2
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:07,580
especially parity can do for us.

3
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:13,680
Suppose we are using parity to detect
bit-flip errors in our dram memory.

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:17,680
Our unprotected memory
has eight one bit arrays,

5
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,400
each of which is 1024 by 1024 bits.

6
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,900
So we have eight small arrays.

7
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:29,080
Each of these arrays is given
the same row and column address and

8
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:33,730
each of these arrays outputs one
bit of the overall eight bit value

9
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:36,240
that we're trying to read or
write in this memory.

10
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:38,840
We want to use parity to
detect bit flips, and

11
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:43,830
what we can afford is a parity bit for
every group of four data bits.

12
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:44,580
The question for

13
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:50,350
you is whether we should add two more
one-bit arrays of this kind for parity.

14
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:53,590
So the idea is that we would
add another array here,

15
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:58,520
and the bit stored here would be the
parity for the first four bits here and

16
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:03,710
another one would store the parity for
these four data bits.

17
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:08,330
Or should we add these additional
parity bits every row in each array?

18
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:12,730
So that we don't need the extra modules
but what we do is we extend each of

19
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:19,520
these modules with the extra bits
that protect the data in that row.

20
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,780
Note that the overall number of bits
that we add is the same in these two

21
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:23,560
approaches.

22
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:26,080
The question for
you is which one is better?
