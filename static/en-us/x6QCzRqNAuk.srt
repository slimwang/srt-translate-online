00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,934
I won't formally prove it here. But the same mirroring matrix can be used to

2
00:00:03,934 --> 00:00:08,154
transform both points and normals. The mathematical explanation is that the

3
00:00:08,154 --> 00:00:12,402
mirroring matrix is like a uniform scaling matrix. However, since no scaling is

4
00:00:12,402 --> 00:00:16,268
actually occurring, we don't need to renormalize the normal. Therefore, this

5
00:00:16,268 --> 00:00:20,317
fourth answer is correct. Intuitively, if you think of going through the looking

6
00:00:20,317 --> 00:00:25,230
glass. Your left and right hand change position, and your body flips, and so on,

7
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:29,325
but your shape and size remain the same, so you don't have to mess around with

8
00:00:29,325 --> 00:00:30,213
your normals.
