1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,310
The answer for this should, maybe was
obvious, and that is, a pattern like

2
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:08,119
this, which basically has more circular
information going out from the middle.

3
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:10,930
Asymmetries and stuff like that
would be quite discriminative, and

4
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:13,650
in fact, when they did
the experiments in that paper,

5
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:16,280
they found this to be
the most discriminative.

6
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:19,460
This actually came out pretty good too,
and this is decent because again,

7
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:22,540
it has more information, but
this one actually came out more.

8
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:26,050
But, of course, a conventional
aperture came out as the worst.

9
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:29,250
This could have been
a little bit of a toss up,

10
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:33,426
this one was actually a really
good aperture design.

11
00:00:33,426 --> 00:00:36,840
Of course in that work, they came
up with various types of metrics

12
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,800
to help you figure out
the best possible design too
