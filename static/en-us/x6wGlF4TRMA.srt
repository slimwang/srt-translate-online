00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,190
Let us examine the relationship
between the method of generate and

2
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:04,700
test, and human cognition.

3
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:09,810
Humans use generate and test as
the problem-solving method all the time.

4
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:14,090
This is because we do not have complete
or correct knowledge of the world.

5
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,300
We do not have infinite
computational resources.

6
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:23,390
And we also do not always have
recourse to a method of reasoning

7
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:24,530
that is guaranteed to be correct.

8
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:30,610
When you do not have these things,
then you use your own test method.

9
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:34,730
You come up with particular solutions to
a problem, you test the solutions out.

10
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:36,420
Beyond human cognition,

11
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:39,514
I'm sure you've come across
the notion of genetic algorithms.

12
00:00:39,514 --> 00:00:43,920
Genetic algorithms are inspired by
the processes of biological evolution.

13
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:48,190
Through operations like crossover and
mutation,

14
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:52,652
one can generate solutions that can then
be tested against some fitness function.

15
00:00:52,652 --> 00:00:56,230
Genetic algorithm are a good example
of the genetical test method.

16
00:00:56,230 --> 00:00:58,030
First, genetic solutions,
then test them out.

17
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:03,300
So this method of generating test is
connected not only with human cognition,

18
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:05,420
but dependently,
also with biological evolution.

19
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:07,300
It's all over the place.
