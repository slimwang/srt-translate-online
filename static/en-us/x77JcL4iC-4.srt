1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:03,160
So again now,
let's look at the whole approach again.

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:07,020
And the same steps but
different details.

3
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:10,090
Compute the Gaussian derivatives at
each pixel, for each and every image,

4
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:11,350
that's what we want to do.

5
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:14,630
Second thing we want to do is
compute the second moment matrix

6
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:16,540
in a Gaussian window around each pixel.

7
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:21,600
Again, find a pixel and going through
this whole image, find a small region

8
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,590
and compute the second moment matrix,
because now we have the derivatives.

9
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:25,630
We know how to do this.

10
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:28,590
And again we want to compute
this within a window.

11
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:35,360
Then using that, remember how we can
actually take R, or compute R from M,

12
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:39,610
by looking at it's trace and
it's determinant, we can compute R.

13
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:41,530
We want to do a little
bit of thresholding on R,

14
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:46,250
because we don't want to just completely
live off the details that we had.

15
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:49,260
Remember we showed you that
with the example image two.

16
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:52,380
The bright white spots
will convert into small,

17
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:54,500
white dots which were hard to see.

18
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:58,370
Then finally find a local
maxima of the response function

19
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:00,360
by using a non-maximum suppression.

20
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,900
And that basically now
starts giving us features.

21
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:04,760
Now we have found
features in two images,

22
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:07,810
which we now can be using to
match between those two images.
