00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The set is an important tool in Python, and today we're going to talk about it.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
A set in Python is simply an unordered collection of elements with no duplicates.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
This unordered and no duplication--these are important clauses.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
The sets used by Python are just a programmatic version of the sets used by mathematicians.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Let's talk a bit about set theory.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Let's say we have a basket of fruit, and let's say it contains 5 apples, 3 oranges, and 2 tomatoes.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
These I suppose would be the apples or maybe the tomatoes, but we don't have to worry about that.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
If we want to represent this as a set, we wouldn't care about this quantity.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The fact that there is 5 apples doesn't matter.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
In fact, I could just write apple, orange, and tomato

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
and label this set "fruit."

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
The elements of this set "fruit" are simply the entries apple, orange, and tomato.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Let's say we also have a set called "vegetable."

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Some of the elements in this set would be broccoli, carrot, and tomato.

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
When I was coming up with this question there was some heated debate in the office

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
about whether tomatoes are fruits or vegetables. Let's just include it in both.

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
That means that when I draw the circle that encompasses this set,

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
it actually has an overlap with the set fruit.

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
In set theory, this overlap is called the intersection.

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'm going to mention these set theory terms, but you don't have to worry about them too much.

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
This diagram I've drawn here is known in set theory as a Venn diagram.

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
They can be very useful for visualizing what's going on with sets.

23
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Here comes the interesting part.

24
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:38,000
We can create new sets by taking subsections or performing operations on these sets.

25
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
For example, if we want to know what elements are fruits and vegetables,

26
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
which like I said before is called the intersection,

27
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,000
we could write "Fruit &amp; Vegetable," and we could see the only element would be tomato.

28
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I should point out that this symbol and the other symbols I will be using are not

29
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
what we usually use in mathematical set theory,

30
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
but since they're what we use in Python I'm going to be sticking with this convention.

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
We could also ask what elements are fruits but not vegetables,

32
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
which is known as the set difference.

33
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
The only element that are fruits but not vegetables are apple and orange.

34
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
We could ask which elements are fruits or vegetables.

35
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Here I've used the vertical line to indicate that. This would give us all of this entries.

36
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
All of these entries are either a fruit or a vegetable or both.

37
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
The last operation I'm going to talk about is asking

38
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
which elements are fruits or vegetables but not both.

39
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
This is known as the symmetric difference.

40
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Here we've used the caret to indicate that, which is not the same as this carrot.

41
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
This is just all of the entries except for tomato.
