1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,620
So reviewing it,
sort of the pros and cons,

2
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:04,790
what's the biggest pro
of account filter.

3
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:08,010
It's all listed here as one but
look, it's just very simple.

4
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:08,960
You know those equations.

5
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:09,830
You just implement them.

6
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:10,900
You write them.
It's compact.

7
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:11,660
It's efficient.

8
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:13,030
It works pretty well.

9
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:15,910
You have to surf,
sometimes tune some things like

10
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:18,290
you never want to let your
process noise get too small.

11
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:22,720
It's much better to overestimate
process noise than under.

12
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:23,910
Why?

13
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:25,420
Because if you, for

14
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:28,780
example, suppose you didn't think
there was any process noise at all?

15
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:32,159
You thought this point is just there,
okay?

16
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:35,470
So you're taking measurements, well,
if there's no process noise, remember,

17
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:38,890
every time you take a measurement, your
uncertainty goes down, eventually you go

18
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:42,810
to an uncertainty of zero and you'll
stop listening to your measurements.

19
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:44,930
So it's always good to have
a little bit of process noise.

20
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:48,310
So there's some tuning to make it work,
but in general, it's pretty clean.

21
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:54,690
The biggest problems with it
are that it's first of all,

22
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:57,510
fundamentally a unimodal distribution,
right.

23
00:00:57,510 --> 00:00:58,940
I've basically got a Gaussian,

24
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:02,090
which means I basically
have a single hypotheses.

25
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:02,680
Allright?
And

26
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:05,099
it's some uncertainty
within that hypothesis.

27
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:06,240
There are some other issues here.

28
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,840
Remember we have this linear model.

29
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,960
There are ways of fixing that.

30
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,800
There's something called
the Extended Kalman Filter.

31
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,910
Which basically just takes,
for those of you who care.

32
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:14,660
You linearize about your current point.

33
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:17,700
That's like taking a Jacobean
around a nonlinear system.

34
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:20,610
you currently estimate it linearly,
update,

35
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:23,300
then recompute your
equations in the nonlinear.

36
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:27,740
Prediction, so the linearity part
is not that big of a problem, but

37
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:31,270
this problem of [INAUDIBLE]
having a single hypothesis okay,

38
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:35,650
that's a Gaussian, that doesn't work so
well sometimes, so the question is

39
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:40,350
what you should do if the world is not
Gaussian or if it's not even unimodal

40
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:43,480
and the answer is, you should come back
next time, because we'll tell you then.
