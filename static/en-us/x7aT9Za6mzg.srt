1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,430
Now that we have a file path where we
can save our GIF's we just need to add

2
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:05,730
two method calls.

3
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:08,450
The method that saves the GIF's,
archiveRootObject,

4
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:12,950
and the method that retrieves them,
unarchiveObjectWithFile.

5
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:16,230
If you look in the app delegate
of the Objective C project

6
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:18,700
you'll see that these two
methods are called here.

7
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:21,140
But we want to keep our
swift app delicate nice and

8
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:24,200
clean, so we're going to call these
methods, in the save to GIF's

9
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:29,730
view controller instead, so
switching back to our swift project.

10
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:32,390
So here we are in our save to
GIF's view controller, and

11
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:34,970
I'm going to suggest that we
call archive root object,

12
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:40,750
as soon as a GIF is saved, here in
the method previewVC, didSaveGif.

13
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:44,415
Now where should we put the method
call that retrieves our GIF's.
