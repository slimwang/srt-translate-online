00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Consider this grammar. It's time for you to test your knowledge

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
by thinking about which of these five utterances are in the language of the grammar.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Check all the apply.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Which of these give strings could be derived from P in this grammar.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Here are the two rules in this grammar, P goes to open parenthesis,

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
P closed parenthesis, or P goes to nothing and can be erased.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Here I have various combinations of open and closed parentheses.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Stare at it for a while and tell me which of these five sequences of strings

9
00:00:34,000 --> 99:59:59,999
could be derived from P in this grammar. Check all that apply.
