1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,449
Further restrictions can be built into a reflection model, such as maintaining

2
00:00:03,449 --> 00:00:07,186
energy conservation. This means that there's not more energy reflected from the

3
00:00:07,186 --> 00:00:10,574
surface than shines on it. For example, the diffuse term should drop off when

4
00:00:10,574 --> 00:00:14,081
the specular term is stronger. This sort of reflection model is called

5
00:00:14,081 --> 00:00:17,910
physically-based since it has some relationship to how light truly works.

6
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:20,165
Within film production and game creation there's a trend towards

7
00:00:20,165 --> 00:00:23,334
physically-based systems. One advantage is that materials are more

8
00:00:23,334 --> 00:00:26,965
understandable by artists. For example, with our energy balanced Blinn-Phong

9
00:00:26,965 --> 00:00:29,890
material we can adjust the shininess without worrying as much that we'll also

10
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:34,615
have to adjust the overall intensity. One element in a physically-based system

11
00:00:34,615 --> 00:00:38,266
is getting the materials right, but that's just to start. For example, the time

12
00:00:38,266 --> 00:00:41,368
of day might change from daytime to twilight, so that the overall illumination

13
00:00:41,368 --> 00:00:45,266
in the scene is considerably less. Instead of making everything dark, some

14
00:00:45,266 --> 00:00:49,084
rendering systems try to adapt. This is similar to what a photographer does by

15
00:00:49,084 --> 00:00:52,391
adjusting the exposure. One way is to compute a high precision image and

16
00:00:52,391 --> 00:00:55,625
automatically change the brightness and contrast to make the displayed image

17
00:00:55,625 --> 00:00:59,892
look good. This sort of analysis and display is called tone mapping and is

18
00:00:59,892 --> 00:01:03,529
fairly commonly used in games and other applications now.
