1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,370
Now that Java and Hadoop are installed,

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:05,660
you'll need to set a few environment
variables on the instance.

3
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:08,950
These will help applications
locate Java and Hadoop.

4
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:12,930
First thing you'll need to do is
note where open JDK is installed.

5
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:15,690
To find it you can use readlink like so.

6
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:19,070
This gives the path to
the Java executable.

7
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:22,070
But here we want the path
to the directory with jre

8
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:24,480
which is the Java runtime environment.

9
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:31,086
As you can see, mine was installed
at usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk-amd64.

10
00:00:31,086 --> 00:00:33,580
But yours might be different.

11
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:35,560
Probably this directory
you're going to use it next.

12
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:39,540
You're going to set the environment
variables in .bashrc.

13
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,710
So open the file in
your favorite editor.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,650
First you're going to have a variable
that points to the Java installation.

15
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:49,010
You're also going to add
the bin directory to the path.

16
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:52,280
You also have a variable
that points to hadoop.

17
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:55,656
Finally add a variable that acts as
a shortcut to the hadoop configuration

18
00:00:55,656 --> 00:00:56,630
directory.

19
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:58,420
This will come in handy later.

20
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:00,170
With these set, save the file and exit.

21
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:05,330
Finally load these
variables with source and

22
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:06,890
check to make sure those
things are set correctly.
