1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
The answer is that you have a 1/3 chance of winning if you stick with door #1

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and a 2/3 chance if you switch to door #2.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
How do we explain that, and why isn't it 50/50?

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Well, it's true that there's 2 possibilities,

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
but we've learned from probability that just because there are 2 options

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
doesn't mean that both options are equally likely.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
It's easier to explain why the first door has a 1/3 probability

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
because when you started, the car could be in any one of 3 places.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
You chose one of them. That probability was 1/3.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
And that probability hasn't been changed by the revealing of one of the other doors.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Why is door #2 two-thirds?

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Well, one way to explain it is that the probability has to sum to 1,

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
and if 1/3 is here, the 2/3 has to be here.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
But why doesn't the same argument that you use for 1 hold for 2?

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Why can't we say the probability of 2 holding the car

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
was 1/3 before this door was revealed?

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Why has that changed 2 and has not changed 1?

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
And the reason is because we've learned something about door #2.

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
We've learned that it wasn't the door that was flipped over by the host,

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
and so that additional information has updated the probability,

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
whereas we haven't learned anything additional about door #1

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
because it was never an option that the host might switch door #1.

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,000
And in fact, in this case, if we reveal the door,

24
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
we find that's where the car actually is.

25
00:01:40,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So you see, learning probability may end up winning you something.
