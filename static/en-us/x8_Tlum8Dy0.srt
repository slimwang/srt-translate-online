00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:02,390
Before we jump into some real code,

2
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:05,700
there's one requirement that
you need to know about.

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:09,264
Service workers require HTTPS.

4
00:00:09,264 --> 00:00:12,201
If your site isn't served
over a secure connection,

5
00:00:12,201 --> 00:00:16,010
the browser simply won't
load the service worker.

6
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:19,981
The only exception is during
development where local host and

7
00:00:19,981 --> 00:00:21,925
its equivalent are allowed.

8
00:00:21,925 --> 00:00:26,090
While this may sound like
an arbitrary requirement,

9
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:29,670
service workers allow you to
intercept network requests,

10
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:34,435
modify them, redirect them,
even totally fabricate responses.

11
00:00:34,435 --> 00:00:36,640
While I'm sure you'll
use this powers for

12
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,740
good, there are some
evil people out there.

13
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:44,340
By requiring HTTPS you can feel
confident that the service worker that

14
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:48,890
gets installed hasn't been tampered with
during its journey across the network.
