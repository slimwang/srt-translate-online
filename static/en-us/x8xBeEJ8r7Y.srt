00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:03,469
Let us do a series of exercises together. This time,

2
00:00:03,469 --> 00:00:06,550
the concept that the AI agent is going to learn about,

3
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:12,190
I'll call it foo. Here is a first example the teacher gives to the AI program.

4
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:15,720
All right, because there is only one example the only kind of learning that can

5
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:19,972
occur here is variabilization. What do you think will be the values that can go

6
00:00:19,972 --> 00:00:23,520
in these boxes here that will variabalize these four bricks.

7
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:26,840
Initially, they are brick one, brick two, brick three, brick four.
