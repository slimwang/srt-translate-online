Another effect size measure for one way ANOVA is called eta squared. This is

00:00:05,264 --> 00:00:09,268
just like r squared from our discussion of t tests. This has the same

00:00:09,268 --> 00:00:13,961
interpretation in ANOVA. This effect size tells us the proportion of total

00:00:13,961 --> 00:00:19,746
variation that is due to between group differences. This is also called

5
00:00:19,746 --> 00:00:25,090
explained variation. Knowing this, how should we calculate eta squared? Check

all that apply.
