Points are good and we use them a lot when we look at real world data, but

2
00:00:03,724 --> 00:00:07,449
what's even better than a point? A line. This is an example of a line on a

3
00:00:07,449 --> 00:00:11,492
coordinate plane. Now this line might not seem that interesting, but its got a

4
00:00:11,492 --> 00:00:15,460
whole personality that we're going to talk about. Notice that this line has a

5
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:19,801
ton of points on it. I have points here, here, here and even anywhere along this

6
00:00:19,801 --> 00:00:24,022
line all of these are points, but there are two points on this line that I find

7
00:00:24,022 --> 00:00:28,477
most interesting. I want you to check the two most mathmatically interesting

8
00:00:28,477 --> 00:00:32,487
points on this line and I should say this is a debatable one. So if you get a

9
00:00:32,487 --> 00:00:36,582
different answer from me it just means we are thinking differently which is

10
00:00:36,582 --> 00:00:36,957
okay.
