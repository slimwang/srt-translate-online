Anamorphic images are ones that require the viewer to

2
00:00:03,516 --> 00:00:07,263
look from a particular viewpoint to show the desired visual.

3
00:00:07,263 --> 00:00:12,290
Other perspectives usually yield a stretched or distorted result.

00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:16,355
Artists use their knowledge about perspective projection to

5
00:00:16,355 --> 00:00:21,368
create some amazing illusions, like this Lego army designed by Leon Keer.

undistort a flat drawing.

00:00:31,387 --> 00:00:36,100
