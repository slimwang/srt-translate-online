1
00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:03,760
Okay, I'll start by looking for bold.

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:07,280
To do that I will hit Cmd+F and
then search for bold.

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:12,110
Now this brings me to a bold
faced element called <b>.</b>

4
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:14,060
That looks pretty reasonable, but

5
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:17,710
it may be hard to see there
is a second search result.

6
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:23,650
So I'm going hit enter again. And
that brings me to the strong element.

7
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:27,420
Now the strong element is
something that has importance and

8
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:29,310
is typically displayed in bold.

9
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:31,900
In fact I recommend using strong.

10
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:33,860
Let me show you how that looks.

11
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:36,870
So I've gone ahead and
wrapped the text with a strong tag and

12
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:39,620
as I said the b would be
fine too if you did that.

13
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:43,420
And then I've saved it and I will come
over to the browser and hit refresh and

14
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:45,970
then wallah the text is bold.

15
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:47,160
Okay next up.

16
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:50,050
I need to make this text emphasized.

17
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:53,560
Back inside the Mozilla developer
network I'm going to search for

18
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,109
emphasis.

19
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,850
There we go.
And that quickly takes me to

20
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:01,290
the em element which you saw before.

21
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:05,740
The element marks that something
has a lot of importance and

22
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:08,030
so that looks good to me.

23
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:12,000
You'll also note that right underneath
it you'll have something called i.

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,490
I will make something
italic incidentally.

25
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:19,520
But you actually aren't supposed to
use the <i> element for any itallics.</i>

26
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,850
It actually has a different purpose
now which you can read about here.

27
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:26,310
Let me show you how
the element looks.

28
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:30,270
So, i've added the opening
tag and the closing tag.

29
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:31,910
Around This content.

30
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:35,690
And then I'll come over to
the browser and hit refresh.

31
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:36,550
And there you go.

32
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:39,000
This text is now emphasized.

33
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,340
Incidentally, in the next lesson
you'll be learning another way

34
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:46,340
of making text bold and italics.

35
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:50,010
I hope you remember that there are many
ways to accomplish a lot of tasks

36
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:50,730
inside the browser.
