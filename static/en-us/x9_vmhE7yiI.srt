00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:04,879
Fun examples of constraint, satisfaction
problems are cryptorithmetic puzzles.

2
00:00:04,879 --> 00:00:08,969
Each letter represents a digit and all
the letters represent different digits.

3
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:11,330
None of the numbers start
with a leading zero.

4
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:14,890
Try to solve the problem and keep track
of the methods you use to attempt it.

5
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:18,250
It takes awhile to figure out these
values and it can be frustrating,

6
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:21,699
however by then end of this lesson,
we'll be using the strategy of back

7
00:00:21,699 --> 00:00:26,750
tracking, with forward checking, using
the minimum remaining values heuristic,

8
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:29,160
and the least constraining
value heuristic.

9
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,090
This will solve the problem in
a principled and efficient manner.

10
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:35,150
These techniques are powerful tools
that can help optimize searching for

11
00:00:35,149 --> 00:00:38,210
solutions for constraint
satisfaction problems in general.

12
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:41,789
Please fill in the boxes for
which number each letter represents.
