1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,450
Now that you filled in the section
headings of your master

2
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:06,430
resume spreadsheet, begin to fill out
the content within each section area.

3
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:07,590
Within each section,

4
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:10,630
you showcase your experience
with bullet pointed statements.

5
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:13,030
So, what does a good bullet
point statement look like?

6
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:15,730
A strong bullet statement
starts with an action verb.

7
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:17,220
Use a variety throughout your resume.

8
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:21,330
A strong bullet point statement avoids
using pronouns and small words.

9
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:26,440
For example, instead of, I built the
toaster, use the phrase, built toaster.

10
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:29,420
This keeps your statement concise,
consistent, and direct.

11
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:31,020
Strong bullet point
statements are concise.

12
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:34,190
These should be a maximum of one and
a half lines each.

13
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:35,920
They also include concrete and

14
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,640
numerical evidence to show
the impact of your work.

15
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,950
Noting achievements and
accomplishments makes a resume shine.

16
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:45,040
How can you creatively transfer your
experience into concise bullet points?
