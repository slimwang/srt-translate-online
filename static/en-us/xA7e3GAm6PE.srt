1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,190
Alright, Sara, I made some CSS changes, how can I,

2
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:05,650
what's the best way to see what they look like?

3
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:08,306
>> Alright, so if we just open up the

4
00:00:08,306 --> 00:00:12,550
HTML file, so this is in the, the main directory.

5
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:13,140
>> Uh-huh.

6
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:15,949
>> This index.html file is what we were looking at earlier, so we

7
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:19,210
just going to open that up, it will open up in your default browser.

8
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:19,930
>> Alright, but this is the game we made.

9
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:23,170
>> And now we have our images instead of the numbers.

10
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:25,420
>> And, this is, this game is actually much harder

11
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:26,125
when there's images.

12
00:00:26,125 --> 00:00:27,830
>> because you don't know what's next.

13
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:29,330
>> Yeah, I don't know what numbers I'm doing, I just

14
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:31,895
know that I want the faces and so these are just

15
00:00:31,895 --> 00:00:34,512
U.S. presidents. It's the first thing that came to mind, but

16
00:00:34,512 --> 00:00:37,270
I mean, there's tons of cool things you can do and the

17
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:41,520
way I did this, was I went into the CSS file.

18
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,420
So we're in main.css and I went to all these places,

19
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:48,270
where it's talking about the actual tile properties. So, what is

20
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:52,030
the two tile look like, the four tile, and so on? And

21
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:53,630
I sort of just overrode the background,

22
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:55,490
I think this was referring to some color.

23
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:57,323
>> Yeah, so the original background was for

24
00:00:57,323 --> 00:00:59,137
each of these a different color instead of.

25
00:00:59,137 --> 00:01:00,541
>> Instead of an image.

26
00:01:00,541 --> 00:01:04,400
>> Instead of an image. So, we actually, if

27
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,230
we were doing this for real, we'd probably want to remove

28
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:08,910
all those, all those backgrounds. I think Andy wanted

29
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:11,210
to be able to revert back if you wanted to.

30
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:13,370
>> I'm still not comfortable with versing control. I know you can just

31
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:16,890
do that on the fly but I kind of like doing this, I'm sorry.

32
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:22,302
But yeah so, I have, I made this folder called Tile Sets, Presidents and then

33
00:01:22,302 --> 00:01:27,627
I just called the different images two, four, et cetera. And this dot,dot slash?

34
00:01:27,627 --> 00:01:30,020
>> Mm-hm. So, what's going on here if I'm, tell me

35
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:33,860
if I'm thinking about this right. Index.HTML lives somewhere in my computer.

36
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:36,440
>> Mm-hm. Yeah, inside this 2048 directory.

37
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,470
>> Okay, and so the dot dot means go back up

38
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:41,924
a directory. Yeah, because this, this style file that we're in is

39
00:01:41,924 --> 00:01:42,843
under Style.

40
00:01:42,843 --> 00:01:44,242
>> So it's going back to the directory.

41
00:01:44,242 --> 00:01:45,117
>> So, we go back up 2048.

42
00:01:45,117 --> 00:01:46,976
>> And then it found.

43
00:01:46,976 --> 00:01:50,700
>> And then go to the tile-sets directory which is just under 2048.

44
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:53,400
>> Okay, and if you open that, that's where

45
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,510
you get our presidents and you have all those files.

46
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:55,725
>> Yeah.

47
00:01:55,725 --> 00:02:00,735
>> Cool, now what are you going to do? I don't know.

48
00:02:00,735 --> 00:02:01,597
>> I don't know. I don't know an answer.

49
00:02:01,597 --> 00:02:02,970
>> Let's keep playing around.
