1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:03,050
Vendors have come up with a variety of strategies for

2
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:05,540
dealing with component versioning issues.

3
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:07,880
At a minimum, version numbers are used.

4
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:10,180
When deployment is performed the version number is used to

5
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:12,200
perform a compatibility check.

6
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:16,370
Other strategies that vendors have taken include the following.

7
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:19,010
Some vendors have ad hoc compatibility rules.

8
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:25,000
That is the rules pertain to the particular version and change between versions.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,190
Some vendors claim that they have immutable interfaces,

10
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:31,190
that is the vendor promises never to change the interface.

11
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:34,380
Some vendors guarantee backward compatibility.

12
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:37,590
Changes can be made but old versions are guaranteed to continue working.

13
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:42,270
Some vendors have sliding windows of supported versions.

14
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:46,480
That is, they will, support the previous five versions or

15
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,320
the previous three versions.

16
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,500
Some vendors take a middle ground saying they're going to break compatibility

17
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,370
only with major releases that include major new features.
