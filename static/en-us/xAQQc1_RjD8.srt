1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,550
So finally, what about non determinism?

2
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:07,130
What if we're using the if-better function at a certain line in the code?

3
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:10,370
Well, then the rules here are actually much simpler

4
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:12,200
than for a normal line of code,

5
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,590
because any time we use the if-better,

6
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:17,040
our rule is going to be

7
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:20,950
that the program either goes to 1 line of code

8
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:22,380
or another one,

9
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:24,010
because that's all the if-better does.

10
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:27,450
The if-better does not modify any variables, it doesn't depend on any variables.

11
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:31,210
It just goes to either one line of code or the other one.

12
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:34,230
So this is a very simple rule that we can use to say

13
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:38,110
what will happen if the program at time point t

14
00:00:38,110 --> 99:59:59,999
point to an if-better.
