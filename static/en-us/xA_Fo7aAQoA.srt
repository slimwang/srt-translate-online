1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,917
So here you can see
the onConnectionSuspended override.

2
00:00:02,917 --> 00:00:05,430
It takes an integer
parameter called cause, and

3
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:09,980
I'm just logging that here in my Log.i
tag, onConnectionSuspended +cause.

4
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:13,950
The other thing that I do is just to
try to connect the GoogleApiClient.

5
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:17,202
This method gets called when the
connection to the services were lost for

6
00:00:17,202 --> 00:00:17,853
some reason.

7
00:00:17,853 --> 00:00:21,248
So calling connect attempts to
reestablish that connection or

8
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:24,715
can get a ConnectionResult that
we can then attempt to resolve.

9
00:00:24,715 --> 00:00:27,932
So next we're going to just implement
some of the status stuff that we've seen

10
00:00:27,932 --> 00:00:30,910
for signing in, whether we're signed in,
and what the progress is.
