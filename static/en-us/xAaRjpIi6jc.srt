00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:05,290
All right, so here is the simple Harris detector algorithm, courtesy 1988,

2
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:06,540
still used today a lot.

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:09,640
We're going to talk about different versions of it, going forward when we

4
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:13,170
talk about scale and stuff, but for now, we're just going to talk about this.

5
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:14,290
And here's the basic algorithm.

6
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:18,710
You first compute Gaussian derivatives at each pixel.

7
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:20,470
Okay? So remember you need this ix and iy.

8
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:23,590
And we've talked all about how to do derivatives,

9
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:26,710
where you take the derivative of the Gaussian operator, apply that, and

10
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:29,530
you get back, your nice image derivatives.

11
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:33,980
Then, you compute that second order moment matrix M,

12
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:35,900
that M matrix that we were talking about.

13
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:39,000
And, the recommendation is you use a Gaussian window so that you

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,880
weight the points near the middle more than the points that are further away.

15
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:46,920
And then you compute, that R function on that M matrix,

16
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:50,480
remember you have a different M matrix for every point in the image.

17
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:51,060
Right?

18
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:54,270
Because you take a little window around a point, compute the moment,

19
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:55,640
compute R, move on.

20
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:58,140
So you do have one for every point in the image.

21
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:02,140
So you get all these Rs, you're looking for high values, you threshold that.

22
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:05,230
And then, and we talked a little bit about this when we were doing the edge

23
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:09,290
detection, you do what's called local non-maximum suppression.

24
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:12,630
Right. So I might have a heart, I might be a strong R value, but

25
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:17,290
if there's a stronger R value next to me, throw me away and keep him.

26
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:18,380
Sorry about that.

27
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:19,610
But the idea is that you're looking for

28
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:22,290
local areas that have the highest possible R value.

29
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:27,203
And like I said, this was presented originally in this paper in 88.
