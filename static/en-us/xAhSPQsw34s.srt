00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:04,320
In the context of data centers, let's
first talk about internet services.

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:07,880
An internet service is any type
of service that's accessible via

3
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:09,440
web interface.

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:13,960
From checking current weather conditions
at weather.com to searching or

5
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:16,079
checking email via Google search and

6
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:21,150
mail services, to making online bank
transactions or flight reservations.

7
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:23,790
The common way in which
these services are used is

8
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:28,330
end users send web requests via web
browsers and then receive a response.

9
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:32,560
Most commonly, these types of services
are then composed into three components.

10
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:36,990
A presentation component that
interfaces with the end users,

11
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:41,430
it's typically responsible for static
content related to the web page layout.

12
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:43,100
A business logic component,

13
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:47,360
this is a component that integrates all
of the business-specific processing.

14
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,970
And this would be all of the dynamic,
user-specific content.

15
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:54,610
And then a component that deals with
all of the data storage and management,

16
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:56,190
typically in a database.

17
00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:00,420
These components are commonly referred
to as the presentation, the business and

18
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:01,740
the database tiers.

19
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:05,580
Although these are separate components,
they are not always implemented as

20
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:09,010
separate processes running
on separate machines.

21
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:11,980
What makes sense will depend
on the service complexity,

22
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:15,140
the resource requirements,
expected loads.

23
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:17,940
And also in the underlying
technologies that are used.

24
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:22,430
For example, the Apache http web
server can be used to implement both

25
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:25,090
the presentation logic,
to serve static content,

26
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:29,090
and also, as part of the same process,
php modules for

27
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:32,672
php processing can be used to
generate the dynamic content.

28
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:36,540
There are in fact many open source as
well as proprietary solutions that

29
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:41,290
are available that offer technologies
for either one of these tiers.

30
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:45,580
To put these applications using
these kinds of tiers together,

31
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:49,190
there are various integrated software,
or rather middleware,

32
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:53,310
components that are used, that
provide commonly used functionality.

33
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:57,990
Messaging services, service
configuration and management, security,

34
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:02,880
accounting, some persistence guarantees,
recovery management, and many others.

35
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,445
One important point to make is that for

36
00:02:05,445 --> 00:02:10,417
services that are organized as
multiple processes, the inter-process

37
00:02:10,417 --> 00:02:15,547
communication between those processes
is carried out via some form of IPC,

38
00:02:15,547 --> 00:02:19,252
such as RPC or RMI, or
from Java based architectures.

39
00:02:19,252 --> 00:02:23,009
As well as, some use of optimizations
that are based on shared memory,

40
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:27,100
in case that different processes
are running from the same machine.

41
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:30,950
So these are some of the examples of the
interprocess communication mechanisms

42
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:33,680
that we already dis,
discussed in this course.

43
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,320
And these are relevant in the context
of real world deployments of

44
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,110
Internet services.
