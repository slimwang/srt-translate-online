1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Let's ask you another question, suppose you care about 95% probability confidence

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
and you want a factor that is no larger than 2.145.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
How many data points do you have to collect at a minimum

4
00:00:14,000 --> 99:59:59,999
to reach a factor that isn't larger than 2.145? You can read this off the table.
