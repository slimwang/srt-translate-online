1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Basically, I calculated the chain first and then I calculated all the other ones

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:16,000
where I couldn't count between the 0 in the first element because I'd already done that

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:23,000
and so it's just one list and write down a whole lot mixed--that one was straight.

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
So it was less than 2n for the combination ??? so it has to be Θ(n).

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
>>Okay. >>And then n-1 links to get the chain. >>Yup.

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:44,000
And then n-2 links to get all the rest. So that's a total of 2n-3 which is Θ(n). Right.

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Right. Yeah. I guess that's kind of another way to think about it.

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I mean in this case I guess it's kind of simple but one thing I'd like to--

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,000
a more complicated guess is like what happens when you add one more edge.

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Like you have your combination lock and you add another edge you can add

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
two more nodes to kind of each edge and add two nodes

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
and so it's going to continue to grow literally.

13
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Then you think about what you have if you have one node.

14
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Yeah. I guess kind of the jump from the first node to the second node is—

15
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Sorry from the first node to the second node is a little different

16
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
because you only had one edge but you know sort of

17
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
when you think of big theta and big O notation

18
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
you're dealing with bigger numbers like how it grows as it gets very large.

19
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Because we're doing big theta you don't really have to think about

20
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
the base case of zero nodes or one node or two nodes.

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
>>Right. >>But if you think about in your case adding any node.

22
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I'm going to add two more edges. So that's ???. Okay. Yes. Just. >>Yup.

23
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Just part of the definition is like you know for all n greater than n₀, okay,

24
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:09,000
like you have fn is less than--like C₁gn or C₂gn and it's this part right here it's like--

25
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
as it gets bigger you can--you don't have to worry about those cases.

26
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
You don't have to worry about all the numbers that are less than some

27
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
and some maybe not but--

28
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I mean for this one it's simple. It's kind of--it's pretty easy to think about.
