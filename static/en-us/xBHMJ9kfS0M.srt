1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:04,080
So what we're interested in is a stable,
virtual camera, which basically means is

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:08,930
we're interested in finding a viewpoint
in the whole image itself, or

3
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:12,780
the video itself, that is actually much
more stable than the original one.

4
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:15,940
So here, basically, now we're
going to start seeing this red line.

5
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:20,010
This red line is going to start showing
you a virtual camera within the original

6
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:23,950
one, and our goal is to
identify from the data itself,

7
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:28,960
what's the best possible red
box here within the big one.

8
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,210
Do remember I did say things like oh,
most of the viewpoints that we're

9
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:34,600
going to get from these
cameras from wide angle, so

10
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:38,020
this does reduce the scope of
the viewpoint by a little bit.

11
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:40,960
We'll talk about variety
of aspects in a bit too.

12
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,220
So here you basically see now What we're
doing is basically tracking the subject

13
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:48,170
and the camera and
refining where this red box could be.

14
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:52,960
Of course in this instance you notice
the red box is going out of the range

15
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:57,680
and the domain, the aspect,
of the image Itself.

16
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:01,280
The challenges with this of
course is if that happens,

17
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,528
we really will actually start
creating problems for ourselves.

18
00:01:04,528 --> 00:01:07,910
We really can't deviate too much from
the original camera, because if we do

19
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:11,680
like for example, when I see the red
box move to this side or that side.

20
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,850
We'll have to start filling in holes,

21
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:17,080
otherwise we'll get black
borders in the image.

22
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:19,770
We can't actually go to
content that we don't have.

23
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:22,250
We have to be always finding
the content that we have.

24
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:24,960
So we want to be able to get
this red box in a region so

25
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,160
I don't have to
synthesize other regions.

26
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:29,900
What that basically means is if I
actually just look at the red box

27
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:30,930
as it is.

28
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:34,600
And I started tracking it,
this is the kind of output I would get.

29
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:38,350
So as the red box moves, basically,
you start seeing black borders.

30
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:40,980
Yes, the subject is now more stable.

31
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:42,890
But, in keeping that stabilization,

32
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:46,900
you notice that I'm actually now
going out of the scope of the image.

33
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:49,490
And I have to then figure out
how to fill up that image.
