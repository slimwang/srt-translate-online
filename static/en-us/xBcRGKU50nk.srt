00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,680
Now that our code is inside a function,

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:05,720
it has to be called, otherwise it won't work.

3
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:09,040
So let's invoke our code right after we define it.

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:13,210
Now first I'm going to give myself a little bit more space here so

5
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:19,700
you can see what I'm writing, and if we call display work and save it and

6
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:24,920
refresh the page, we can see that our work experience appears right here.

7
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:29,310
>> Hm, so, James, when you wrote display work, you didn't put an argument in,

8
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:30,790
you didn't pass in a parameter.

9
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:33,060
That's pretty interesting, why didn't we have to use one?

10
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:37,060
>> Well, this function is using an object that's in the global scope for

11
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:40,880
the script, meaning it's accessible to the function which is also in

12
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:41,960
the global scope.

13
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,900
>> True, but let's imagine that we wanted to,

14
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:47,930
I don't know, for some reason, add multiple different work sessions to the page.

15
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:49,780
Then, what would be need to do?

16
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:51,860
>> That sounds like a job for an argument.

17
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:56,020
If this function took in an argument, we could pass it different work objects,

18
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:58,170
which would each get displayed on the page.

19
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:00,060
>> You think we should do that?

20
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:03,960
>> I'm having a hard time imagining, why you want to do that for this example.

21
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,180
I have a better idea.

22
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:08,680
Lets say you wanted to track where users are clicking on your site.

23
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:12,820
We could collect the cursor location every time a user clicks on the page and

24
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:15,100
send that off to our analytics site.

25
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:16,729
>> Interesting, let's see how that works.
