I only need 2 numbers. For example to talk about this point I would indicate how

2
00:00:06,171 --> 00:00:11,739
far it is along the x axis and then how far along it is on the y axis. I would

3
00:00:11,739 --> 00:00:17,590
move 2 units to the right and then 4 units up. So this point would be 2, 4. I

4
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:23,408
went 2 in the horizontal direction and then 4 in the vertical direction.
