00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,052
So I'm going to give you a hypothetical example, and ask you to tell me the

2
00:00:05,052 --> 00:00:10,226
mode. Most people live to be about 60 or more. So let's say that this is 60

3
00:00:10,226 --> 00:00:15,797
here. But unfortunately, some people reach the end of their time when they're

4
00:00:15,797 --> 00:00:21,353
younger. So where would you say the mode is? Would you say it's here, here, at

5
00:00:21,353 --> 00:00:22,460
60? Or up here?
