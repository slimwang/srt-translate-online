1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,630
For higher order roots though, we need to do something a little bit different.

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:08,370
If you remember we had a product rule that let us split up a root of a and b.

3
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:11,370
If these were factors of a radicand we could split the root up into the nth

4
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:15,588
root of a times the nth root of b. Well it turns out there's a similar rule for

5
00:00:15,588 --> 00:00:19,334
division. The quotient rule lets us take the in root of a fraction we can just

6
00:00:19,334 --> 00:00:24,467
split it up into m through it of a divided by the m through it of b. This means

7
00:00:24,467 --> 00:00:29,366
that the cube root of this fraction becomes the cube root of 27. Divided by the

8
00:00:29,366 --> 00:00:34,490
cubed root of 16. We're just using our quotient rule. We know the cubed root of

9
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:39,600
27 will end up being 3, since we can rewrite 27 as 3 cubed. But we can't

10
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,740
exactly take the cubed root of 16, 16 is 2 to the 4th. We don't want this cubed

11
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:48,632
root to appear in the denominator, so we need to rationalize this part. If we

12
00:00:48,632 --> 00:00:51,706
can get this power to be a multiple of 3, then we would be able to take the

13
00:00:51,706 --> 00:00:56,722
cube root of it. For example, I really want this denominator to become the

14
00:00:56,722 --> 00:01:00,650
cubed root of 2 to the 6. I can take the cubed root of this, it's just 2

15
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:05,680
squared. So when we reationalize the denominator of a higher order root. We

16
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,645
want to raise the power of each factor of the radicand to be a multiple of the

17
00:01:09,645 --> 00:01:14,542
index of the root. In other words, we want to have powers inside the radical

18
00:01:14,542 --> 00:01:19,320
that are evenly divisible by the index of the root. So, what would be multiply

19
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:22,974
this numerator and this denominator by to change our denominator into this

20
00:01:22,974 --> 00:01:28,600
form? Keep in mind that whatever we multiply the denominator by we need to

21
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:33,106
multiply the numerator by since we're really just multiplying by a form of 1.
