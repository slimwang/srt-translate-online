1
00:00:00,292 --> 00:00:03,210
All right, let's try to load and display an image.

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:06,760
To load an image, we want to use the imread command.

3
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:10,170
The image will be stored in this variable img.

4
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:14,010
To display it, we want to use the imshow command.

5
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:17,506
Hit Test Run and scroll down to view the output.

6
00:00:17,506 --> 00:00:20,052
A bottlenose dolphin surfing the waves.

7
00:00:20,052 --> 00:00:23,200
All right, what more can we find out about this image?

8
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:26,130
What if we wanted to find out the size of the image?

9
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:28,960
You guessed it, we'll use the size function.

10
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,060
That returns the size of the image.

11
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:34,060
To display it, we'll use the disp function.

12
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:38,390
We can also find out the class or data type for the image.

13
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:38,960
Go ahead and

14
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,120
type out these commands, run the program, and note down the results.
