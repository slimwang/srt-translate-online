1
00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:04,050
With the Alpha-Beta Model,
an algorithm has three costs.

2
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:06,030
The message cost defines the first two.

3
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:11,300
It's essentially the latency, alpha,
and the inverse bandwidth, beta.

4
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:12,740
Now our algorithm will, of course,

5
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:17,440
do other kinds of basic operations
like comparisons and arithmetic.

6
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:21,360
Let's denote the cost per
compute operation by tau.

7
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:23,530
Now in practice,
it turns out the following is true.

8
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:29,030
Tau is typically much less than beta,
which is in turn much less than alpha.

9
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:31,050
To give you an idea,

10
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:34,150
you should be thinking of something
like 10 to the minus 12 seconds,

11
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:38,500
versus 10 to the minus 9 seconds,
versus 10 to the minus 6 seconds.

12
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:40,760
So something like three orders
of magnitude in between.

13
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,740
Let's suppose you buy this.

14
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:44,470
Here's my question.

15
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:46,920
Which of the following claims is true?

16
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,850
And I want you to check all that apply.

17
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:52,520
Is it true that computation is
less than communication, so

18
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,688
you should avoid communication?

19
00:00:54,688 --> 00:00:57,660
Or is it true that it's faster
to send a few large messages,

20
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:00,080
rather than many small messages?

21
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,620
Or is neither of these statements true?
