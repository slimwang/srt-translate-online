1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,620
So, finally, I just want to
talk about a couple of issues

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:06,360
that you'll always face
when you're doing tracking.

3
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:09,180
So the first one is initialization.

4
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:11,030
How do you start the thing?

5
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:13,270
And there's no good answer.

6
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:15,010
The examples I showed you
before were done manually.

7
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:17,290
Somebody says, oh, track that.

8
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:18,460
Okay?
So you draw a little ser, you say,

9
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:20,280
keep track of that thing.

10
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:23,390
You might have a background
subtraction method.

11
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:26,490
Okay, so every now and then, you may
be able to subtract that background,

12
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:27,280
find the objects.

13
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:31,276
And say okay, keep track of that
object because it's isolated.

14
00:00:31,276 --> 00:00:34,982
And I'm going to track it as it
moves along even when it becomes

15
00:00:34,982 --> 00:00:39,130
like partially occluded or, or
with other moving things in the way.

16
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:44,165
Or, you might have a detector that can
detect things when they're clear and

17
00:00:44,165 --> 00:00:45,824
fully visible, right?

18
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:48,141
So I've got a a bank robber detector.

19
00:00:48,141 --> 00:00:48,906
No.

20
00:00:48,906 --> 00:00:52,427
I, I might have a particular
car detector and it'll say, oh,

21
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:53,827
a jeep has just shown up.

22
00:00:53,827 --> 00:00:55,880
Follow that jeep.

23
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,300
So the detector is running, and

24
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:01,300
it'll only fire sometimes, when it
gets a good, clear view of something.

25
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:03,950
But then you want to track and
follow it through.

26
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:08,370
Next question is where do you get your
sensor and your dynamics models from?

27
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:10,000
Well we've talked
a little bit about this,

28
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,380
your dynamics models you maybe can
learn by essentially from real data.

29
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:17,630
That's generally pretty hard.

30
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:20,370
Because if you could track the real
data without the dynamics model,

31
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:22,600
you wouldn't be using
the dynamics model.

32
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,130
So, you might use it from clean data.

33
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:26,040
Remember we talked about
the girl jumping in front of

34
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,030
the black background?

35
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:28,570
That would be some clean data.

36
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:31,850
Or it says here you might
specify domain knowledge.

37
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:33,660
That means you're,
like, the smart person.

38
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:34,840
You just write down what it is.

39
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:38,620
Or you take another trip to Delphi, and
you get another thing from an oracle.

40
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:40,800
Now, for the observation model,

41
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,920
typically, it says generative
observation model.

42
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,060
What that means is,
remember we did the, the model for

43
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:48,790
the robot sensing distance.

44
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:52,290
So if I knew the,
the wall was three meters away.

45
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:53,410
And I take some measurements.

46
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:55,750
And, I collect them and
I get a distribution.

47
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:58,200
Now I know what my
distribution would be.

48
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,960
The trick is, I had to know that the
thing was actually three meters away, or

49
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:02,560
two meters away.

50
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,430
Right, I have to know the ground truth.

51
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:07,370
So you have some sort of
absolute sense or measurement.

52
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:08,800
Prediction versus correction,

53
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,080
remember this whole thing
about tracking and inferences.

54
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:14,740
I make some prediction, I take some
measurements, I do my correction.

55
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:17,300
The question is,
what's that relevant trade-off?

56
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:19,413
Remember we talked about
this in Kalman filter,

57
00:02:19,413 --> 00:02:23,850
which basically came down to what's
the relative size of the noise of my

58
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:26,250
measurements versus
the noise of my process.

59
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:27,390
Actually, we usually do
it the other way around,

60
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:30,530
the noise of my process versus
the noise in my measurements.

61
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:32,710
If one is too strong,
you'll ignore the data.

62
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:36,910
If the other is too strong,
you'll ignore the predictions.

63
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:40,750
So getting those balanced right
is just a little bit of magic

64
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:42,690
that you have to do based
upon looking at the data.

65
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:47,170
Here's a more interesting or
I should say fundamental one and

66
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:49,410
it's referred to as data association.

67
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:53,740
Data association basically
is what if we don't know

68
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:56,760
which measurements to
associate with which tracks?
