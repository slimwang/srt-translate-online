1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:03,430
We actually didn't need to
configure the Camera Roll.

2
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:04,580
But, on a physical device,

3
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:07,620
we could've modified it to get
an image using the camera.

4
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:11,340
For the Activity View,
we supplied an image to be shared.

5
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:15,760
For the Alert View, we supplied
the title, message, and OK button.

6
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:18,980
And, for the Dice View Controller,
we supplied the two die values.
