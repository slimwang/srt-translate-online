1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,360
The Android plugin can handle
a large range of use cases, but

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,440
it has sensible enough defaults to
make simple builds straightforward.

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,690
In addition to handling the actual
business of building and

4
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:12,630
packaging your app, the Android
plugin provides a bunch of different

5
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:16,510
configuration and customization
options for us to mess with.

6
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:19,760
Of these available capabilities,
we'll be covering six main themes.

7
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,570
That Android developers are commonly
find themselves wanting to do in

8
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:24,660
their Gradle Android builds.

9
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:26,670
The first is build variants.

10
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:29,760
It's often useful to build slightly
different versions of the same app,

11
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,570
such as debug version for
testing and a release version for

12
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:34,050
the Google Play store.

13
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:38,070
Another common use case is a free
version and a paid version of your app.

14
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:40,270
The Android plugin makes
it easy to share code and

15
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:43,148
other common resources
between these variants.

16
00:00:43,148 --> 00:00:46,220
Second, the androidplug in
allows us to manage dependencies

17
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:48,520
on a per variant basis.

18
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:51,300
Third, the android plugin
can override resources and

19
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:54,260
manifest entries also
on a per variant basis.

20
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:57,070
In lesson four we'll talk about some
of the more advanced features of

21
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:59,830
the android plugin which
include application signing,

22
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:00,990
pro guarding and testing
