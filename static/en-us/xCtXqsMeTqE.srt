00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,005
Now, we've already seen these in practice, but there are some helpful facts

2
00:00:03,005 --> 00:00:07,478
that we can use to solve logarithmic equations. The first is that if a to the x

3
00:00:07,478 --> 00:00:13,640
equals a to the y, then we know that x must equal y. We saw this earlier in the

4
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:20,866
problem 3 to the x equals 27. We rewrote 27 as 3 cubed. And since we have 3 to

5
00:00:20,866 --> 00:00:27,355
the x equal to 3 to the y, we can set this exponent equal to this one. The next

6
00:00:27,355 --> 00:00:31,255
fact that can help us solve equations with logarithms is that if a to the x

7
00:00:31,255 --> 00:00:38,200
equals b to the x, then we know that the base a must equal the base b. We see

8
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:43,745
this in a problem like this. X squared equals 5 squared. Well we know since

9
00:00:43,745 --> 00:00:48,628
these are both squares then x must be equal to 5. In order for this amount on

10
00:00:48,628 --> 00:00:53,235
the left, to be equal to this amount on the right. The last fact that we'll use

11
00:00:53,235 --> 00:00:58,593
is that if log of base b of n. Equals log base b of n, then we know that m must

12
00:00:58,593 --> 00:01:03,635
equal n. Since we're taking the log of base b, we know that these two numbers

13
00:01:03,635 --> 00:01:07,417
must be the same in order for the logarithms of those numbers to both be the

14
00:01:07,417 --> 00:01:13,443
same as well. We haven't seen an example like this yet, but we'll use this idea

15
00:01:13,443 --> 00:01:15,770
in the upcoming problems.
