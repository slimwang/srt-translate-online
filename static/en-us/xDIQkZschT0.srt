00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:05,050
The National Academy of Sciences was
formed by President Abraham Lincoln

2
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:08,640
to provide independent
objective advice to the nation

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:11,010
on matters related to science and
technology.

4
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:16,079
For many years its healthcare component,
The Institute of Medicine,

5
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:20,540
which recently became The Academy of
Medicine, was instrumental in raising

6
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:24,010
the alarm that U.S. healthcare has
the problems we've been discussing.

7
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:28,690
The institute has called for
a new, learning health system.

8
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:32,170
We don't have time to discuss that in
detail, but here's a simple health

9
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:37,130
infomatics perspective that shows how
electronic records, if they're adopted

10
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:42,460
and can share data, become a source of
information from actual patient care.

11
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:47,350
It can then be aggregated and analyzed
to develop new knowledge, that in turn,

12
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:51,840
through an informatics powered feedback
loop, leads to continuous improvement.
