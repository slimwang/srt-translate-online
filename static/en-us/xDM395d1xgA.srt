00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,820
So, you've got three
minutes to deliver a pitch.

2
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:04,670
And it's possible

3
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:07,430
that you're losing their attention
in the first ten seconds.

4
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:09,080
Do you know what to do?

5
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:10,060
Hopefully now you do.

6
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:12,400
Congratulations, you made
it through the lesson.

7
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,310
In this lesson you organize your
story into a pitch you can use to get

8
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:18,480
attention, overcome objections,
and secure investment.

9
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,820
This is a huge accomplishment,
so, great job.

10
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:25,200
You've got an amazing story to tell and
now it's time to go out and tell it.
