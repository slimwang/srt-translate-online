1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Instead of developing your own,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
in many cases you can, of course, use somebody else's solver.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
There are lots of ready-made software for that.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
First of all, there is general mathematical software--

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
application packages, which can do differential equations,

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
but which also can do lots of other stuff.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
First of all, MATLAB and its clones, such as Octave or SyLab,

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Wolfram Alpha if you manage to formulate your problem in one line,

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Mathematica, and tons of others.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Second, there is dedicated modeling and simulation software,

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
such as Simulink, which comes with MATLAB, COMSOL, Multiphysics,

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
and Wolfram Alpha System Modeler, and PyDS Tool,

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
which is based on, as the name says, Python.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Then there are lots of code libraries that you can use to build your own application.

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
One important library to mention here is scipy integrate--

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
obviously for Python again.

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
To create plausible motion for games, there are a number of physics engines.

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Finally, there are cook books providing snippets of code to be reused or adapted.

19
00:01:03,000 --> 99:59:59,999
The most prominent one of these are the Numerical Recipes.
