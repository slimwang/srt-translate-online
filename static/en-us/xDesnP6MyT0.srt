00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:04,760
Now, let's calculate the degrees of freedom. Again, let's pretend that we don't

2
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:10,680
have any of these values, but we do have the marginal totals. How many values

3
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:15,710
here of these six can we choose, so that we'll always have the same marginal

4
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:16,170
totals?
