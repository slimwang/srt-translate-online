Many classes needed to collect objects of another class. Use an array list or

2
00:00:04,982 --> 00:00:10,043
maybe an array for the collecting. Supply a method for adding to the collection

3
00:00:10,043 --> 00:00:15,256
so that it can get bigger over time. And depending on your problem, maybe you

4
00:00:15,256 --> 00:00:20,680
want to have a method from removing items from the collection. You'll want to

5
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:27,133
supply some methods to find out about the contents. Maybe something that prints

6
00:00:27,133 --> 00:00:33,610
the contents, maybe to test whether a given value is in the collection. That

7
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:38,624
depends on the individual situation. And here's a bonus tip when you declare

8
00:00:38,624 --> 00:00:43,860
that array list or array, don't forget to initialize it in the constructor.

9
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:47,640
because otherwise it will be null, and when you add the first element, you'll

10
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:53,620
get a null pointer exception. Sadly that happens to me a lot. So let's practice

11
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:58,658
that with another variation of the car class. In this case we want to collect

12
00:00:58,658 --> 00:01:03,722
the names of the passengers. And I've already declared an array list of strings

13
00:01:03,722 --> 00:01:09,380
for you. So that's the instance variable. And your task is to update that

14
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:13,344
instance variable in a couple of methods.
