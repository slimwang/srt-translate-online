00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,810
As a final debugging exercise, I want
you to debug the problems that I've

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:08,360
introduced to the visual debugging
scene of the so many bugs app.

3
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:12,320
Now you may be tempted to just copy the
code from the final working scene, but

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,480
I highly encourage
that you don't do this.

5
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:18,410
Instead I want you to use the debugging
tools we've learned especially

6
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:22,180
the visual ones to debug and
fix the problems in the scene.

7
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:25,779
As you work through each problem that
you can find write the steps that you

8
00:00:25,779 --> 00:00:27,906
take to debug the problem
in this text box.

9
00:00:27,906 --> 00:00:31,978
And if you're feeling really adventurous
also include your hypotheses about what

10
00:00:31,978 --> 00:00:33,790
is causing the bug before you fix it.
