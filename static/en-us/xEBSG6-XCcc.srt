00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,022
Our goal is to find the maximum
point in this graph or

2
00:00:03,023 --> 00:00:05,919
any n-dimensional graph in general

3
00:00:05,919 --> 00:00:10,509
which represents some goodness function
we are trying to optimize for a problem.

4
00:00:10,509 --> 00:00:12,719
One way to do it is
simple hill climbing.

5
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:15,850
Where we start somewhere say
at the right most point and

6
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:19,910
then improve our answer by traveling
up the gradient to some maximum.

7
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:22,870
The problem is we can get
stuck in a local maximum.

8
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:27,330
Mark the methods which can be used to
un-stick us and find the global maximum.

9
00:00:27,329 --> 00:00:31,399
Again, we do not expect you to know
the answer to the challenge question.

10
00:00:31,399 --> 00:00:34,560
But it is a way for you to preview what
you will learn in this section and

11
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,120
determine how hard the section will be.
