1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:06,020
>> And welcome back. While we were away we actually had to sensley take home the

2
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:09,815
the Golden Brain for detecting a difference of under 2%.

3
00:00:09,815 --> 00:00:13,650
>> That's amazing, I guess that you were proved wrong, but your human difference

4
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:15,990
threshold average of 3%.

5
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:17,915
>> Well, Andy, that is why they call it an average.

6
00:00:17,915 --> 00:00:21,941
>> Well, either way, it's pretty amazing and even more importantly I'm okay and my

7
00:00:21,941 --> 00:00:24,185
bleeding has stopped.

8
00:00:24,185 --> 00:00:26,085
>> Andy, it was a paper cut.

9
00:00:26,085 --> 00:00:27,063
>> Lauren, it hurt.

10
00:00:27,063 --> 00:00:28,565
>> Well, I'm glad you're feeling better.

11
00:00:28,565 --> 00:00:31,066
>> Thanks, but this bandaid actually feels a little weird.

12
00:00:31,066 --> 00:00:31,645
>> How so?

13
00:00:31,645 --> 00:00:33,626
>> Well, I don't know. There's all these little groves in it, and they're kind of

14
00:00:33,626 --> 00:00:34,309
bothering me.

15
00:00:34,309 --> 00:00:38,437
>> Hmm. That's your mechanoreceptors sensing that.

16
00:00:38,437 --> 00:00:39,668
>> Wait. My what?

17
00:00:39,668 --> 00:00:43,538
>> Your mechanoreceptors. They're little neurons in your skin that are sensitive

18
00:00:43,538 --> 00:00:46,824
to different things, like grooves or texture, shape, even vibrations and

19
00:00:46,824 --> 00:00:48,272
motion.

20
00:00:48,272 --> 00:00:53,136
>> And each one is sensitive to its own specific sort of texture? >> Yeah.

21
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:56,402
>> That's really fascniating. It's almost like the rods and cones in our eyes,

22
00:00:56,402 --> 00:00:57,659
which we use to.

23
00:00:57,659 --> 00:01:00,509
>> Andy, I'm going to stop you there, I just gt word from Susan that they're

24
00:01:00,509 --> 00:01:04,589
going to start the brain ceremony. We'll get back to that in a minute.
