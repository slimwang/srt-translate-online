00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,469
If you'd play your application to App Spot, you

2
00:00:02,469 --> 00:00:04,930
can explore the entities in the data store using the

3
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:07,860
Admin Console. Let's take a quick demo of how

4
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:11,110
to get there. So to get to the Admin Console,

5
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:15,290
you go to console.developers.google.com. And it will list your

6
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:19,160
projects. This is one project here, and then you click

7
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:21,480
on that. You click on the project that you want

8
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,630
to investigate. And it will take you to the dashboard

9
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:28,580
for your project. So you see there's a, an App Engine

10
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:31,930
section that let's you get to various. Things about App Engine,

11
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:34,200
I think you already looked at that. So if you click

12
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,720
down here, you see the cloud data store option. And this will

13
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:41,150
take you to the dashboard for your data store. Dashboard shows

14
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:44,650
you various kinds of information about your project. You can get

15
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:48,400
statistics of all your entities, you get breakdown by property type.

16
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:51,040
You can get the total size of the entities that are stored

17
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:55,120
in the data store. See this here, the indexes?

18
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,390
You'll be learning about indexes really soon. So, go

19
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:00,610
ahead, you can go ahead and explore the, the

20
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:04,349
dashboard, see what kind of information is in there. What

21
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:07,490
I really want to talk about is the query.

22
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:10,790
So, if you click query, it takes you to

23
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:13,300
the page where you can find out information about

24
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:15,970
the entities that have been saved. This kind of menu,

25
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:19,430
just like in the local host. Admin Console lists

26
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:22,520
the kinds of entities that are stored. Right now

27
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:25,670
I only have profile, and these other two things

28
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:28,670
are internal to App Engine. I'm looking at the entities

29
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:31,360
of kind profile, I've only got one, that's the

30
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,420
profile that I just created. You can see the display

31
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:37,690
name, the main email, the tee shirt size. Can

32
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:41,020
drill down into it if you want. You can even

33
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:43,650
change the values here. Obviously you'd really only

34
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:47,390
want to do that during development. This is

35
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:50,640
where you would come to check your entities. And it can be a really useful tool.
