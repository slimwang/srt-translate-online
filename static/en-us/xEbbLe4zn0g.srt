1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,600
The answer here is 3 to the power of N/2

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:07,160
is the same as 3 to the power of Â½ to the power of N,

3
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:11,290
which is the same as the root of 3 to the power of N,

4
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:17,070
which, if you use a calculator, is 1.733 to the power of N.

5
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:20,540
Instead of 2 to the power of N assignments,

6
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:23,830
we now only have to check 1.733 to the power of N.

7
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:26,700
We have just squashed the exponent of our algorithm

8
00:00:26,700 --> 99:59:59,999
using a smart search tree instead of brute force.
