2
00:00:03,417 --> 00:00:06,328
I think I would go as far
back to say it was when I was

3
00:00:06,328 --> 00:00:08,290
doing my undergrad thesis.

4
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:13,000
I was learning about the effects
of language loss and

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,740
its toll that it has
taken on my identity.

6
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:20,470
Being Miwok and not knowing
the language or the traditions,

7
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:26,650
it really felt I don't know the word for
it could be, you know inadequate.

8
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:31,610
You know I don't know much about my
heritage, my culture and I want to

9
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:34,900
know more and I want to be able to pass
that knowledge down to my children.

10
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:39,307
So I started looking into basket
weaving a little bit of the language.

11
00:00:39,307 --> 00:00:43,255
I started interviewing my
grandmother and my mother and

12
00:00:43,255 --> 00:00:48,467
trying to get as much information I
could from my closest family members.

13
00:00:48,467 --> 00:00:51,827

14
00:00:51,827 --> 00:00:56,807
But then I found a website that was
built by one of the tribal members, and

15
00:00:56,807 --> 00:01:02,360
it had certain audio clips of counting,
and colors, and things like that.

16
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:06,548
And I started playing
with it with my son and

17
00:01:06,548 --> 00:01:11,260
we would click on the numbers and
before I would click the next one,

18
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:15,228
wait let me try to say it so
I can see if I can say it right and

19
00:01:15,228 --> 00:01:19,520
it just went from like a game
that my son and I played.

20
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,520
And I wanted to do more with that and

21
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:25,720
I figured that a lot of families are
kind of in the same situation we are.

22
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:26,980
We're in the Bay Area,

23
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:31,690
which is about two hours away
from the tribal community.

24
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:34,520
And if there are more people
who are far enough away,

25
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:38,020
it's not accessible to them, so
let's bring the language to the people.
