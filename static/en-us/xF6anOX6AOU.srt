1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,419
First we're going to look at the number of steps, the step complexity.

2
00:00:02,419 --> 00:00:04,361
And that should be the same as reduction

3
00:00:04,361 --> 00:00:07,452
since all are running as a whole bunch of parallel reductions.

4
00:00:07,452 --> 00:00:09,514
The reductions all have different sizes.

5
00:00:09,514 --> 00:00:13,487
So to get the overall step complexity, we need to look at the largest reduction,

6
00:00:13,487 --> 00:00:17,917
which is a reduction at the end here of all n elements.

7
00:00:17,917 --> 00:00:21,006
So the number of steps to reduce n elements

8
00:00:21,006 --> 00:00:25,833
and thus the number of steps to perform this entire computation is O(log n).

9
00:00:25,833 --> 00:00:30,777
To compute the total amount of work, we notice that we're going to have n reductions to perform.

10
00:00:30,777 --> 00:00:33,614
The 1st reduction requires 0 additions,

11
00:00:33,614 --> 00:00:36,244
the 2nd reduction requires a single addition,

12
00:00:36,244 --> 00:00:44,230
the 3rd reduction requires 2 additions and, in general, the nth output will require n - 1 additions.

13
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:50,392
And so what we're going to have to do is sum up that whole series, 0 + 1 + 2 on to n - 1.

14
00:00:50,392 --> 00:00:55,138
And if we do add up that series, we're going to find that the result is roughly n^2 /2 additions.

15
00:00:55,138 --> 00:01:00,373
So the overall amount of work is proportional to the square of the number of elements.

16
00:01:00,373 --> 00:01:04,432
We would say that the number of additions overall is O(n^).

17
00:01:04,432 --> 00:01:08,298
So while we like having a smaller number of steps than the serial version--

18
00:01:08,298 --> 00:01:10,409
remember that took O(n) steps--

19
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:15,625
this quadratic work complexity makes this formulation of scan ridiculously inefficient.

20
00:01:15,625 --> 00:01:20,835
So what we're going to do next is look at 2 other algorithms that have a more reasonable cost.
