00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:05,600
Okay, here's what I do. Since the constructors are pretty similar, I'm going to

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:10,425
copy and paste. Now I can keep these statements because I still want to

3
00:00:10,425 --> 00:00:15,060
initialize the miles driven as the gas in tank is 0. And I still want the miles

4
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:19,400
per gallon to be the parameter that was passed in. But over here, I don't want

5
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:23,450
this fixed picture. Instead, I want this one, and that's the answer. Now I can

6
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:27,620
construct a current two ways. I can specify the fuel efficiency and get the

7
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:32,350
default picture. Or I can specify both the fuel efficiency and the name of a

8
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:35,560
picture file, and then the second constructor is chosen.
