00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,690
So, you might be wondering why
do I need a master resume?

2
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:07,240
Let me tell you about how it helped
me during my own job search.

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:09,650
As I happened to be a person
with many different interests,

4
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:13,290
I have worked in many different fields
and positions from media to epidemics,

5
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:16,770
publishing non-profits,
technology startups, and as a performer.

6
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:17,890
Before moving to the US,

7
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:21,180
I had over 14 years of professional
experience under my belt.

8
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:24,520
Many of these experiences are very
interesting to talk about, like being

9
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:28,350
a producer of a daily talk show with
lots and lots of paternity testing, but

10
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:32,340
completely irrelevant to a career I
wanted to pursue in a new continent.

11
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:35,930
Right before I started at Udacity,
I worked for a cultural institution of

12
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:38,990
the Federal Republic of Germany,
who wanted to have all the dates and

13
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:42,710
names of everyone I ever worked with and
every training I've ever taken.

14
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:45,350
It's rare that anyone besides
the government will want to know this

15
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:46,570
much about you.

16
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:50,370
In fact, a guiding rule of thumb in this
lesson is to keep resumes to one page if

17
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:55,470
at all possible but what I submitted to
this institution wasn't a normal resume,

18
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:56,940
it's what I later called
my master resume,

19
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:00,480
a seven page tome of
all of my experiences.

20
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,570
What was really helpful,

21
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:04,760
is that as long as I kept my master
resume up to date, I could use it as

22
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:08,720
a data source to populate any kind of
one page resume I wanted to write and

23
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:13,470
as a project manager I often needed to
tweak my resumes depending on the job.

24
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:16,890
For example, when applying to Udacity,
I was able to pull out

25
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:20,700
all of my education experience as well
as my experiences managing products of

26
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:23,160
international scale and
technology companies.

27
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,080
It's that kind of targeting
that gets you an interview.
