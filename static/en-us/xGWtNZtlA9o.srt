1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,319
Since you want to divide this entire side by 4, but we know that 12 is going to

2
00:00:04,331 --> 00:00:08,674
multiply each of the terms inside the parentheses, you can conveniently just

3
00:00:08,686 --> 00:00:12,844
divide 12 by 4, which is something really nice. That just gives us 3 as our

4
00:00:12,856 --> 00:00:17,138
coefficient instead of 12. Over here, the 4 is canceled out and we just have 2x

5
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:17,498
plus 7.
