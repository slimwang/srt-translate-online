1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,750
So, let's say we have a problem that we know to be an NP

2
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:06,450
but we're not sure if it is contained in P or not.

3
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:09,780
In that case, there is actually only two things that could be true

4
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:13,190
so either that problem is actually NP but we missed it

5
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:16,440
so we simply haven't looked hard enough to find a good algorithm for it

6
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:20,380
or that's the other possibility the problem is only contained in NP.

7
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:25,330
So, no matter how hard we look, we will never find a polynomial time algorithm for it.

8
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:29,820
The cool thing is that for some problems we know that they are closely related enough

9
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,340
so that it's actually sufficient to decide this question here

10
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:39,240
if we missed a polynomial time algorithm or if we just have no chance.

11
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:43,230
It's actually sufficient to decide this question for only one of the problems.

12
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:46,360
So for vertex cover, independent set, and clique, in the last unit,

13
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:49,550
we found out that those problems were closely related.

14
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:55,390
So, let's just do a little quiz to see if you remember how these problems were related to each other.

15
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:59,290
So, let's assume we found a polynomial time algorithm for vertex cover.

16
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:03,340
In that case, we would know for sure that vertex cover is contained in P.

17
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:05,870
So what will be the case for independent set and clique?

18
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:07,940
Would we also know these problems to be in P

19
00:01:07,940 --> 99:59:59,999
or would it not be possible to make such a statement?
