1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
We answer this question by first writing down the fundamental equation here,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
which is delta x over f relates to B over Z.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
To see this, we find by equal triangles that this triangle over here

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
described by Z over B, is the same as these 2 things over here

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
put together into a single triangle, which is delta x over f.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
This proportionality must be the case.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
This can now be transformed to solve for Z.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Z equals f over delta x B.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
If we plug in f with delta x, we get 10 times 0.1 which is 1.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
We can resolve B is delta x over f times Z.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:54,000
We plug in delta x, 0.05, divided by 50 is 0.001 times 100 gives us 0.1.

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
We can also resolve it for f, which is Z over B times delta x.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Z over B is 10 times delta x as 0.1 gives us 1 over here.

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Finally, we can resolve it for delta x.

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:14,000
B over Z times f. B over Z is 1/50 times f as 200 gives us 4 over here.

16
00:01:14,000 --> 99:59:59,999
All the units fall out by themselves.
