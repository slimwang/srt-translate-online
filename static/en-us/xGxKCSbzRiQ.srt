1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:01,170
Let's start with A.

2
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:04,300
Going up we can see that we're at 2 on the x axis.

3
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:06,850
And we're at the same level as this point over here.

4
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:08,940
So we're at 1 on the y axis.

5
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:11,480
So we've got 2, 1.

6
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:13,010
Next up looking at B.

7
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:15,110
We are one line over.

8
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:17,570
So we know that the x has to be 3.

9
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:21,420
And we've gone down one, so our y is 2.

10
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:22,530
Last but not least with C,

11
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:28,320
we're at 1 on the x axis and we're at now 3 on the y axis.

12
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,730
So we've got 1, 3.

13
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:30,590
Important to note,

14
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:35,310
these are not negative numbers, these are positive numbers on the y axis.

15
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:37,700
The y axis gets more positive the farther down you go.
