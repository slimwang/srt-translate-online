1
00:00:00,168 --> 00:00:02,270
Another area that you know,

2
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:06,420
really blossomed lately is the use of computer vision for automotive.

3
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:07,070
This is a,

4
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:11,080
a website, web picture taken from Mobileye, which is a company out of Israel.

5
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:14,620
And they've developed all sorts of technologies that use computer vision that

6
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:16,780
are relevant to automobiles.

7
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:19,670
Everything from automatically recognizing signs to,

8
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:21,870
here it's a little hard to see, red outline.

9
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:25,360
The system is automatically identifying where the pedestrians are.

10
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:29,040
They have a system that alerts you if pedestrians getting close and

11
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:30,710
you're, seem to be going too fast.

12
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:34,310
You can also build systems that either brake or slow down or whatever.

13
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:37,004
But the idea is that computer vision has really gotten into smart cars.

14
00:00:37,004 --> 00:00:39,900
And in fact, smart cars are here.

15
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:42,750
So this car, some of you know, that is Stanley.

16
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:44,590
Stanley was the Stanford.

17
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:46,230
That's the little red S there.

18
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:49,370
Entry into the Urban Grand Challenge run by DARPA.

19
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:51,100
And it was started by.

20
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:52,630
Stanley was run by this guy.

21
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:53,890
What's his name?

22
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:57,080
Oh yeah, Thrun something, I don't know Sebastian.

23
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:59,140
He's the guy who also started Udacity.

24
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:02,910
He's sort of a way under achieving, no ambition kind of guy.

25
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:04,432
They won that.

26
00:01:04,432 --> 00:01:07,853
And then Sebastian, because he's just out there,

27
00:01:07,853 --> 00:01:12,607
convinced Google to get involved in the making the automobile process.

28
00:01:12,607 --> 00:01:14,940
The self driving car, which most of you have heard about.

29
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:17,250
Here's a picture of it out on the highway.

30
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:20,130
And the real mark that these things are here today is.

31
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:25,310
States now have starting passing legislation that helps detail, well who's at

32
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:29,280
fault if an accident happens on a particular road and it's a self driving car.

33
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,380
So this is where technology starts to hit policy and economics, and

34
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:33,430
that's when you know it's real.
