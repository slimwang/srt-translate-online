1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,150
If you think back to the table
views we've built so

2
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:06,420
far, Bond villains, make your
own adventure, favorite things.

3
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:10,422
They all had an array of data that
they used to populate a table.

4
00:00:10,422 --> 00:00:14,090
For meme, we're going to have two
view controllers displaying memes.

5
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:16,000
A collection and a table.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,320
They could each have their
own separate array of memes.

7
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,090
But that doesn't seem right.

8
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:23,950
The two ViewControllers should
be accessing the same data using

9
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:25,560
a shared model.

10
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,950
So where can one keep a data model so

11
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:30,740
that it can be accessed
by both ViewControllers?

12
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:34,470
The AppDelegate, the delegate
to the UIApplication object,

13
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:37,720
is a good place because it can be
accessed from anywhere in your project.

14
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,810
Now keeping data in the App delegate
is a little bit controversial.

15
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:45,430
But in our case,
it's the simplest option.

16
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:49,140
And there are solid precedents for it,
including Xcode's core data templates.

17
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:54,250
You can add your memes array to
the App Delegate with this line of code.

18
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:57,040
And whenever you create a meme,

19
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:59,340
you'll want to add it to
the app delegates array.

20
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:02,230
So you could add the following code in
the view controller that edits the meme.

21
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:07,330
And finally, when you want to access
this data from the collection view

22
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:11,180
controller or the table view controller,
you could add these lines.

23
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:14,640
For a recap of the code in these three
methods, see the upcoming text note.
