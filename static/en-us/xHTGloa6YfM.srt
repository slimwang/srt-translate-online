1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:02,160
This is the correct answer.

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:06,990
XYZ has a lower return and
higher volatility than SPY.

3
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:11,276
You can tell that if you look
here at the mean of XYZ,

4
00:00:11,276 --> 00:00:14,983
you can see it's lower
than the mean of SPY.

5
00:00:14,983 --> 00:00:19,908
You can see the shoulders are broad on
XYZ, meaning it's got a larger standard

6
00:00:19,908 --> 00:00:23,123
deviation, and therefore,
higher volatility.

7
00:00:23,123 --> 00:00:26,462
Dave will show you now how to
plot histograms like this,

8
00:00:26,462 --> 00:00:28,680
right next to one another in Python.
