1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:04,854
All of these questions can be answered with a simple term, learning. Learning

2
00:00:04,854 --> 00:00:09,670
is defined as enduring changes in behavior that occur with experience. Learning

3
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:13,384
is fundamental to being successful in our environment. In this lesson, we're

4
00:00:13,384 --> 00:00:16,910
going to cover three distinct types of learning. First, we're going to look at

5
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:20,899
the classic, Pavlov's dog and classical conditioning. Then, we're going to look

6
00:00:20,899 --> 00:00:24,839
at B. F. Skinner and his rats, and operant conditioning. And, finally, we're

7
00:00:24,839 --> 00:00:28,480
going to look at Albert Bandura's Bobo doll study and social learning.
