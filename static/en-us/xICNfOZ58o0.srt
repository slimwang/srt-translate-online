1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,460
Is it true that users often
start at the random point but

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:05,305
then fall back to a common pattern?

3
00:00:05,305 --> 00:00:11,420
Okay, actually users typically
start at the left upper corner.

4
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:16,710
Because stuff in English and many
other languages, we go left to right.

5
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:19,570
So, sort of, that bias is still there.

6
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:23,790
So there is, people really
don't start at a random point.

7
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:25,032
I won't check that answer.

8
00:00:25,032 --> 00:00:27,924
There's a bias in starting at
a point near the top left, okay?

9
00:00:27,924 --> 00:00:31,095
We just said that so
we're going to check this answer and

10
00:00:31,095 --> 00:00:34,543
the next one is the ease of moving
from current to next point.

11
00:00:34,543 --> 00:00:38,395
Okay, going right or down rather than
diagonal in the opposite direction or

12
00:00:38,395 --> 00:00:39,548
something like that.

13
00:00:39,548 --> 00:00:44,236
The ease of moving from your current
to next actually also introduces bias,

14
00:00:44,236 --> 00:00:47,480
an easier pattern on you and
how you sort of enter it.

15
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:52,090
So second and third options make
those patterns less random.

16
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:55,680
There are more common patterns because
of ease of use reasons, because of

17
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,920
the bias in sort of where people
like to start, and things like that.
