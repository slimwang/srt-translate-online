00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:01,829
Hi, I'm Sebastian.

2
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:03,695
I'm delighted to welcome you to

3
00:00:03,694 --> 00:00:08,070
Udacity's Artificial
Intelligence Nanodegree program.

4
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:12,002
We think it provides
an experience unlike any other.

5
00:00:12,002 --> 00:00:16,596
AI is really about unleashing one of
the most amazing things in the entire

6
00:00:16,596 --> 00:00:18,416
universe, intelligence.

7
00:00:18,416 --> 00:00:20,664
AI is growing exponentially and

8
00:00:20,664 --> 00:00:25,576
will change our world at a rate that
will far surpass changes brought by

9
00:00:25,577 --> 00:00:29,090
humans because AIs can
learn much faster than us.

10
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:32,769
Just look at self driving cars.

11
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:36,670
Any time you drive,
only one person gets better, you.

12
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:39,448
But with AI, anytime an AI car drives,

13
00:00:39,448 --> 00:00:43,838
all cars get better,
including all future autonomous cars.

14
00:00:43,838 --> 00:00:48,637
After completing this program, you'll
be positioned to take full advantage of

15
00:00:48,637 --> 00:00:50,758
such changes that AI will usher in.

16
00:00:50,758 --> 00:00:55,390
You will be ready to work with
trans-disciplinary thinkers and

17
00:00:55,390 --> 00:01:00,719
practitioners to create technologies
that will shape our future world.
