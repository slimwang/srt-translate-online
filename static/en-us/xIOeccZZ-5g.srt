1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,810
Now imagine yourself working as a front end web developer.

2
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:08,248
You've just gotten a design from your company's graphic designer and

3
00:00:08,248 --> 00:00:12,800
you now need to take this image or PDF file and turn it into a website with

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:18,250
all the necessary components, HTML files, CSS files, and JavaScript files.

5
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:18,820
>> Yep.

6
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:22,665
But how do you translate that visual design into an actual website, right?

7
00:00:22,665 --> 00:00:24,270
And, where do you start?

8
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:25,460
What decisions do you need to make?

9
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:26,105
What do you need to know?

10
00:00:26,105 --> 00:00:28,730
>> Mm-hm. >> And these are like excellent questions to ask.

11
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:32,020
But before we do that, we should probably build a good conceptual understanding

12
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:33,070
of the way websites work.

13
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:34,250
>> Yep, exactly.

14
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:38,010
So, you can think of a website much like your house.

15
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:41,740
HTML files are like the structure where the wall's placed.

16
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:43,310
What room is your livingroom?

17
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:44,220
What room is your kitchen?

18
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:45,340
Which room is your bedroom?

19
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:49,700
CSS files are then the style of your house.

20
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:50,870
What color is the carpeting?

21
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:52,630
What decorations do you have up?

22
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:53,859
What color are the walls?

23
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:59,890
JavaScript files are then your interactive components.

24
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:04,300
You can think of them like your garage door opener, or your television remote.

25
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:06,530
They're changing some element of your house.

26
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:11,100
Now much like there are rules for how things in your house behave,

27
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:14,350
you can't have a television that's just floating on the wall.

28
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:16,400
It has to be attached by something.

29
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,600
There are also rules for how websites behave.

30
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,350
The same goes for tools.

31
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:24,840
You can't put together a bookshelf, for example, without a screwdriver.

32
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,470
And there are also many web tools available to help you build your websites.

33
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:29,730
>> Yeah, that's a great point.

34
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:31,250
I love this analogy, it's an awesome analogy.

35
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:34,250
What do you say we get started in learning some of the basics?

36
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:34,770
>> Sounds great.
