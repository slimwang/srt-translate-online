1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,680
It's time to expose the secure
monolith pod externally and

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:06,530
to do that will create
a kubernetes service.

3
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:08,760
Explore the monolith
service configuration file.

4
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:15,350
Things to note, one we've got a selector
which is used to automatically find and

5
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:17,830
expose any pause with the labels.

6
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:21,375
App equals monolith,
secure equals enabled.

7
00:00:21,375 --> 00:00:26,390
Two, now have to expose the no port
here because this is how we will for

8
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:31,850
external traffic from port 31 thousand
to engine next on port four four three.

9
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:35,380
Use the kubect1 create command
to create the monolith service

10
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:37,960
from them on the service
configuration part.

11
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:41,910
This output is telling us you're
using a port to expose the service.

12
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:45,920
You're going to have port collisions if
another app tries to bind to that port

13
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,860
on one of your servers.

14
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:50,850
Kubernetes handles this port
assignment for us normally.

15
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:55,230
Here, I chose one so that it's easier
to configure health checks later on.

16
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:57,910
Use the G Cloud compute
firewall rules command

17
00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:02,190
to allow traffic to the mildest
service on the exposed no port.

18
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:04,970
Now that everything is set up.

19
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:09,040
We should be able to hit the secure
monolith servers from outside cluster,

20
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,320
and what value is in port 40.

21
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:14,330
First let's get an IP address for
one of our nodes.

22
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:18,740
And then try hitting the secure
Monolith service using Curl.

23
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,590
That's not working.

24
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:23,220
What's going wrong?

25
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:28,210
On that note I'm going to stop here and
see if Carter can help us troubleshoot.
