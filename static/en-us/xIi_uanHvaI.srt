00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
All right, now we know that 3 colorability is NP hard.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:11,000
If I give you a general graph and say--can you assign colors to these nodes, at most three colors

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
to these nodes so that no two nodes that are connected have the same color.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Answering that yes or no for all possible graphs is probably computationally intractable.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
It's as hard as any problem in NP. What is that tell us about 4 colorability.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
So I want you to check all the things that are true because we know that 3 colorability is an NP,

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
then 4 colorability is an NP because we can quickly verify a certificate that list the color assignments.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
So is it true that 4 colorability is an NP for this reason.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:53,000
It's not necessarily an NP because the number of colors is bigger than in the 3 colorability case.

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Is is the case that it is not necessarily NP hard

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
because having four colors to work with makes things easier.

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
So just because something is hard to color with three colors,

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
it could be quite easy to color with four colors.

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Next, no, no--it is NP hard because the solution to 4 colorability also solves 3 colorability

15
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
and the reason for that is we can just add another node to the graph,

16
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:27,000
connect it to all the other ones and then try to color that graph, and then finally, since any graph

17
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:36,000
that is 3 colorable is 4 colorable, the problems are basically equivalent, so it's the same.

18
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
So check all that apply. There are two of them that apply.
