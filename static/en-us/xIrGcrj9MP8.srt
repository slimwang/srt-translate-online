00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:06,330
Let us consider an example. We are shown initially three images, A, B and

2
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:12,200
C. And you have to pick a candidate for the D image here on the top right.

3
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:17,320
And it can be one of these six candidates that would go here in the D image.

4
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:20,170
Given that A is to B, as C is to D,

5
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:24,410
what would you pick among the six choices at the bottom to put into D?
