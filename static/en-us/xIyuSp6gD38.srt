1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
[Narrator] The answer is 0.34.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
To compute this, we need to use the conditional probability rule.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
We already know the probability of B, which is X is a vowel.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
We computed that in question 1 as 0.38.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
What we need is the probability of A intersect B.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Well, B is--the events were X is a vowel.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
A are the events where is equal to E.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Whenever X is equal is to E, it's also a vowel.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
That intersection probability is the same as the probability that X is equal to E,

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
which is 0.13, and dividing those we get the result 0.34.
