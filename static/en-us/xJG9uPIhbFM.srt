1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,070
So, you know how to draw lines now.

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:04,770
Let's try drawing a really,

3
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:09,020
really complicated line
called the dragon curve.

4
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:12,440
The dragon curve is a fractal with
some really cool properties, and

5
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:15,010
it has a reasonably simple rule for
producing it.

6
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:18,370
The base case is just
an elbow like this, and

7
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:21,690
we'll call this L for a left turn.

8
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:25,777
Now the recursive rule is to
produce a dragon curve of order N,

9
00:00:25,777 --> 00:00:29,705
you take a dragon curve of order
N minus one, turn left, and

10
00:00:29,705 --> 00:00:33,896
then reverse and reflect the dragon
curve of order N minus one.

11
00:00:33,896 --> 00:00:35,720
Sounds straightforward right?

12
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:37,510
Let's do a few examples.

13
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:41,880
So, the dragon curve of order two
is the left turn that we got from

14
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:46,390
the dragon curve of order one,
followed by another left turn, and

15
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:50,620
then we reverse and reflect this left
turn, which is just a right turn.

16
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:51,660
This is what this looks like.

17
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:54,120
We make a left turn, we make
a left turn, we make a right turn.

18
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:58,350
The third order dragon curve is already
starting to get pretty complicated.

19
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:02,093
We've got LLR from the second
order dragon curve.

20
00:01:02,093 --> 00:01:08,402
We've got an L and then we have LLR
reversed and reflected, so LRR.

21
00:01:08,402 --> 00:01:12,830
The fourth order dragon curve is
starting to get pretty squiggly.

22
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:16,120
And the fifth order dragon curve is
starting to get just ridiculous.

23
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:18,900
You can start to see some
interesting properties though.

24
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:22,750
The curve will touch itself, but
will never actually cross itself.

25
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:25,010
Once you get up to the tenth
order dragon curve,

26
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:29,650
it starts to look pretty beautiful,
like a crazy galaxy or something.

27
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:33,500
So to draw the dragon curve, we need to
first work out the turns the curve will

28
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:37,210
take, translate those curves
into line segments, and

29
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:39,970
then use ShapeRenderer
to draw a polyline.

30
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:41,670
Sounds easy enough, right?

31
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:43,200
Well, give it a try, but

32
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,250
this one's a lot harder than
anything else we've done today.

33
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:48,830
If you just want to check out
the reference solution, that's fine too.
