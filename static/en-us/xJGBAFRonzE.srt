1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,210
I'll take a look at
the smaller layout first.

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:07,720
Box A takes up 50% of the viewport,
and has an order of negative 1,

3
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:11,430
which looks like it's the lowest
meaning box A comes first, but

4
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:14,370
probably means the Red Box is box A.

5
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:18,440
Container 2 has a width of 50% and
no order.

6
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:21,320
So, I think it's probably a good
guess that container 2 is

7
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:24,300
talking about the light blue and
the green divs.

8
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:27,830
I can see that boxB must
come after boxA, and

9
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:31,050
because this doesn't have an order,
it's probably order 0,

10
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:35,940
so that means that boxB is
going to be the Dark Blue Box.

11
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:39,480
That probably means
the Green Box is boxC.

12
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:43,710
But, I want to take up the larger
viewport to confirm my suspicions.

13
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:47,290
I can see that boxC has an order of
negative 1 in the larger viewport,

14
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:50,870
which means that it looks like
it's going to come first.

15
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:53,780
That's a pretty good argument
that the Green Box is boxC,

16
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:56,070
but letâ€™s just goes ahead and make sure.

17
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:59,860
Box B has a width of 25%,
and an order of 2.

18
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:03,670
Which is the largest one I see here,
so it's probably going to come last.

19
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:08,720
Well that seems to make sense, because I
said that the Dark Blue Box is boxB, and

20
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,760
here boxB seems to be the last one.

21
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:17,190
BoxA is 25% and comes right before boxB.

22
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:18,860
Which makes it the red one.

23
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:23,230
So, I'm feeling pretty good about
my answer that the Red Box is boxA.

24
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:26,840
And lastly, there's still this
container class with a width of 50%.

25
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:30,210
And it looks like it's still being
applied to the light blue, and

26
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:31,710
the green boxes.

27
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:37,150
So, in the end, boxA is Red,
boxC is Green, and boxB is Dark Blue.
