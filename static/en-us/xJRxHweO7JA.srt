00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:03,230
A Team is probably best modeled as a Kind.

2
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:07,460
It's a concrete structure that can have many entities.

3
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:10,380
A Game is also best modeled as a Kind,

4
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:13,500
for the same reasons as for Team. The Winning

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,590
Team is probably best modeled as an Entity. But,

6
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:18,840
this answer is not so straightforward. It could, for

7
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:22,480
example, be a Property Value in an Entity. A

8
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,520
Player is probably best modeled as a Kind for

9
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:29,910
the same reasons as Team and Game. And, the Player Name sounds

10
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:33,800
like it's modeled through a Property Value. I hope you did well on

11
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:38,320
the quiz. All right, that's an introduction to DataStore. Now, it's about time

12
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,880
to check out some code, don't you think? Let's do that. Good luck.
