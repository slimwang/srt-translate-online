1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:05,939
>> So, Susan, you say savory uses MSG. Can you describe this for us please?

2
00:00:05,939 --> 00:00:09,790
>> That's a great question Lauren, I'm glad you asked. This flavor is actually

3
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:14,693
called Umami, which means pleasant savory taste. You'll find this Umami taste

4
00:00:14,693 --> 00:00:18,660
in things such as aged meats and cheeses. It's a very difficult flavor to

5
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:22,320
describe, but it's also found in MSG, or monosodium glutamate, which is a

6
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:28,000
flavoring. So, savory is really a combined sense of both MSG as well as the

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,785
perceived savory odors by your nose.

8
00:00:31,785 --> 00:00:36,238
>> Interesting. So, what's expected of our sensthletes after they're presented

9
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:37,726
with this sample?

10
00:00:37,726 --> 00:00:41,443
>> Well, our senseletes will be presented with five samples, and each of these

11
00:00:41,443 --> 00:00:46,939
will have a very light version of the flavor. Then, they'll have to correspond

12
00:00:46,939 --> 00:00:51,242
and taste each one and correctly identify the basic favor.

13
00:00:51,242 --> 00:00:54,695
>> Now, do we have a projected winner for this event?

14
00:00:54,695 --> 00:00:59,946
>> Well, Lauren. I'm not sure what the stats are for these senseletes. So, we'll

15
00:00:59,946 --> 00:01:00,895
just have to wait and see.

16
00:01:00,895 --> 00:01:03,610
>> Actually, Susan. If you don't mind, I can interject here. I was speaking to a

17
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:06,368
senselete earlier, Alex, who I suspect may win.

18
00:01:06,368 --> 00:01:07,102
>> Why is that?

19
00:01:07,102 --> 00:01:09,690
>> Lauren, stick out your tongue.

20
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:10,592
>> Like this?

21
00:01:10,592 --> 00:01:12,756
>> Exactly. Now, do you want to feel the surface for me?

22
00:01:12,756 --> 00:01:13,534
>> Mm-hmm.

23
00:01:13,534 --> 00:01:15,822
>> Can you feel tiny little bumps?

24
00:01:15,822 --> 00:01:16,386
>> Yeah.

25
00:01:16,386 --> 00:01:19,226
>> Now, those bumps are actually clusters of taste buds. And we call these

26
00:01:19,226 --> 00:01:20,325
clusters papilla.

27
00:01:20,325 --> 00:01:22,235
>> Huh. That's interesting.

28
00:01:22,235 --> 00:01:26,235
>> It is. You can actually stick your tongue back inside now, yeah. So, anyways,

29
00:01:26,235 --> 00:01:30,833
humans, on average, have about 10,000 taste buds. Alex, with 10,000 plus

30
00:01:30,833 --> 00:01:35,255
another extra thousand, 11,000 taste buds, just may take home the golden brain

31
00:01:35,255 --> 00:01:36,835
today.

32
00:01:36,835 --> 00:01:40,000
>> That's interesting, Andy. Well, I'm actually getting word that our senseletes

33
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,169
are ready to begin. So, back to you Susan, with coverage of the event.
