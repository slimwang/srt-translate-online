1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:03,785
And what sort of things do you think
in your personality, or maybe in your

2
00:00:03,785 --> 00:00:07,270
co-founder's personalities, made you
guys so successful at the beginning?

3
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:11,100
>> When I look back at that,
I really think it was, I mean it was,

4
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:12,930
first of all it was a lot of hard work.

5
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:15,080
It was a lot of luck, frankly.

6
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:17,750
I think we worked a lot
on our communication.

7
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:22,400
But more than anything else, it was
hustle, and it was the willingness and

8
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,530
the ability to get back
up each time we stumble.

9
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,350
Every entrepreneur goes through
some great highs, hopefully,

10
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:33,860
and some real low lows and when
you're working, whether it's alone or

11
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:36,900
with somebody else,
the ones who are successful are the ones

12
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:40,520
who are able to stand up after
falling over and dust themselves off.

13
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:42,050
And learn what they needed to from it.

14
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:44,565
I think what I just talked
about was an example of that.

15
00:00:44,565 --> 00:00:46,610
>> Yeah.
>> Where you could see actually when you

16
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:50,110
looked back at our progress, how we
were learning that lesson the hard way.

17
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:52,630
Probably took us way to long,
but we learned it.

18
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:53,220
>> And you got there.

19
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:54,290
>> And we got there.

20
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:56,770
>> So what sorts of skills do you
think are really important for

21
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:58,827
entrepreneur to have at the outset?

22
00:00:58,827 --> 00:01:00,580
>> I'm going to just pick two things.

23
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:02,930
The first one is resilience,

24
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:06,340
just being able to bounce back after
something doesn't go your way.

25
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:09,500
You have to get really comfortable
hearing the word no and as a small

26
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:13,200
company that nobody knows about
you're going to hear it an awful lot.

27
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,880
And the second one is I think the
willingness to step outside of whatever

28
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,240
room it is that you're in.

29
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:23,210
And maybe this is motivated
by the fact that I

30
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:26,330
come at this from an engineering
perspective where the easy part and

31
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:29,750
the fun part is writing code,
is building something.

32
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:34,390
But that was never useful to do
that until I had built a real

33
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:36,550
understanding of what
the customer wanted.

34
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:39,020
And that doesn't happen until
you get outside of your room and

35
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:40,580
start talking to people.

36
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:43,380
And so, I think,
developing those two skills is more

37
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:45,570
important than anything else,
at the outset.

38
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:48,440
>> So, what's one thing that you wish
you would have known before getting

39
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,320
started with Optimizely?

40
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:53,440
>> You know, when we started
our entrepreneurial journey,

41
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:56,230
we started actually working on
something completely different.

42
00:01:56,230 --> 00:02:01,190
And we built an education platform for
young kids called Carrot Sticks.

43
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:04,380
Had nothing to do with what
we ended up working on.

44
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:07,210
I think when I look back at
that time what strikes me is

45
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:11,510
how much time we spent working on things
that didn't actually end up mattering.

46
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:14,530
We spent a lot of time building
things that nobody cared about

47
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:18,100
because we didn't spend enough time
getting to know our customers.

48
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:23,260
And we struggled for a year,
frankly, without salaries,

49
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:27,420
and that was a pretty difficult time and
I think during that year we had to

50
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:31,610
really erase what we thought we
knew about starting companies and

51
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:36,530
really learn how to probe and
understand the customers that we were.

52
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:37,540
trying to serve.

53
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:40,940
And you can see that in our first
company, Carrot Sticks, it took us about

54
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:45,250
six months before we earned
a dollar doing what we were doing.

55
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:48,800
With our second company, which I won't
even go into, it took about a month and

56
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,104
a half, so
you can see our learning scale shrunk.

57
00:02:51,104 --> 00:02:54,960
And then with Optimizely we
actually were able to earn money

58
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,740
on day one before we'd written any code.

59
00:02:56,740 --> 00:03:01,210
And I think that's the signal for, first
of all, the fact that we'd gotten better

60
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:05,350
at understanding our customers, but also
for how skeptical we'd gotten of our own

61
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:08,550
ideas, and that we weren't even willing
to work on something unless we were able

62
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:11,350
to prove that it was something
people wanted enough to pay for.
