00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:06,090
Consider the following set of events on node N1 and node N2. N1 is sending a

2
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:08,460
message and the act of sending the message,

3
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:11,380
the event associated with that is F. And

4
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:17,000
A is the act of receiving the same message on node N2. And B is another event on

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:25,200
node N1. Textually follows this send event. And G is another event on node N2.

6
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:28,530
Textually follows the receive event G. Now the

7
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:32,090
question for you, what can you say about the

8
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:35,960
relationship between the events A and B? What

9
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,590
can you say about the relationship between these two

10
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:40,430
events A and B? I'm going to give you

11
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:45,450
three choices. The first choice is A happened before

12
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:47,460
B, so I'm going to say that is the first

13
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:50,620
choice. The second choice I'm going to say is B

14
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:53,580
happened before A. And the third choice is neither.

15
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:56,020
And it's okay if you get it wrong, it's

16
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:57,900
just to, sort of, prime the pump for the

17
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:59,610
next concept that I'm going to describe to you.
