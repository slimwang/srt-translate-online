Our person class is looking pretty good, but we're still missing a method. Can

2
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:07,290
you remember what the method was? Maybe you want to pause the video and think

3
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:11,850
about it for a second. Did you pause? The answer is, we forgot the getFriends

4
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:16,320
method. We can put all of this data into our object, but we can't get it back

00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,380
out. John still can't get the list of people he added and forgot. If you

00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:23,130
remembered that, good work paying close attention. If not, I understand. I

00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:27,890
forget methods sometimes. You go back and you fix it. In BlueJ, implement the

00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:29,270
get friends method.
