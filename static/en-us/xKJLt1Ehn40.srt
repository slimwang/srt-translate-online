1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The answer is that the problem is the balanced parentheses.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Regular expressions can handle a set number of nesting parentheses--one or two or three--

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
but they can't handle an arbitrary number of nestings.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
It makes sure that all the left parentheses balance with the right parentheses.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
We're going to need something else.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
The thing we traditionally look at is called context-free languages,

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
which are more general than the regular languages.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 99:59:59,999
We'll see how to handle that.
