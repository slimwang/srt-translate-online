1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:02,100
What about the correction?

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:02,780
Okay?

3
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:05,330
Well the correction is
a little complicated.

4
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:07,920
So what I'm going to do, is I'm going
to show you the formula for it.

5
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:10,386
Then I'm going to give you
the intuition behind it.

6
00:00:10,386 --> 00:00:12,070
Then I'll show you,
actually, not the formula,

7
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:14,100
I'm going to show you
the simple formula for

8
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:16,740
the 1D case,
give you the intuition behind that.

9
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:19,740
And then give you the full formula for
the ND case.

10
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:23,610
First remember that we're assuming
our measurements are again just

11
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:28,790
some constant times the actual
state plus some Gaussian noise.

12
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:29,610
Okay?
That's our,

13
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:32,960
that's our linear system plus
Gaussian noise for the common filter.

14
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,770
Remember, we have our predicted state.

15
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:35,460
We just did that.

16
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:39,130
We said that that's Mu sub t minus.

17
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:41,490
All right?
That's the predicted mean, and

18
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:47,610
then sigma t minus squared that's
the variance of the prediction.

19
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:51,920
And what we want is we want
the corrected estimated distribution.

20
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,640
That's what this is, here.

21
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:54,790
All right?

22
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:58,060
So in Kalman with linear,
Gaussian dynamics and

23
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:02,820
Gaussian measurements, the corrected
distribution is defined to be, and

24
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:06,590
I'll show you that,
a new Gaussian, okay?

25
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:12,610
Which is now mu t plus and
sigma t squared plus, all right?

26
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:14,950
And what I want to do is, I want to
show you the formula for that and

27
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:17,340
then give you the intuition behind it,
okay?

28
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:20,040
This is the formula for the mean.

29
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,160
Okay?
So here is mu t plus, and

30
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:29,840
it's a combination of mu t and the y,
which we'll get to in just a minute.

31
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:35,860
The update the variance is here,
so sigma t plus squared, okay?

32
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:40,290
And you'll notice that what's
happening is that this number,

33
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:42,950
if you just do a little bit of this math
here Is actually going to end up being

34
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:47,240
smaller, okay,
than the predicted variance.

35
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,490
And that makes sense why?

36
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:51,330
Because remember after we take
a measurement our variance goes down.
