00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,790
Thank you for
adding your video to the card showcase.

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:05,460
It's really going to help the next
generation of Android students to see

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:08,010
what you did, and
then try doing it themselves.

4
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:10,270
As for me, I'm going to show
this to someone special.

5
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:13,070
Hey Ben,
>> Hey, how's it going?

6
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:14,220
>> Happy Birthday!

7
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:15,170
>> Thank you, so much.

8
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:19,230
>> Yeah, actually I made this for you
>> Oh, I remember this picture.

9
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:20,470
>> I'm glad you like it.

10
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:23,910
Actually, making this card, it really
helped me learn a lot more about view

11
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:26,560
groups and layouts and
it really helped our students too.

12
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,170
>> You know who would
love this is my mom.

13
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:29,680
I'm going to go show this to my mom.

14
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:32,280
>> Wait, wait Ben, that's my work phone.
