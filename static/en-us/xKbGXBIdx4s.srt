1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:03,741
So I can show you an example of this being done in 2D, that is,

2
00:00:03,741 --> 00:00:05,082
with an image, here.

3
00:00:05,082 --> 00:00:05,963
Okay?

4
00:00:05,963 --> 00:00:08,034
Here we have a, an original image,

5
00:00:08,034 --> 00:00:11,701
a beautiful little still life of some fruit in black and white.

6
00:00:11,701 --> 00:00:16,636
And here is its Fourier transform power spectrum, just the magnitude, so

7
00:00:16,636 --> 00:00:18,841
I'm not showing you the phases.

8
00:00:18,841 --> 00:00:20,646
The middle, remember, we took,

9
00:00:20,646 --> 00:00:23,521
we put the origin in the middle, is the low frequency.

10
00:00:23,521 --> 00:00:27,560
And you can see that it falls off as you get out to the outside.

11
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:31,309
Now, we're going to blur this thing with a Gaussian.

12
00:00:31,309 --> 00:00:35,966
And I'm showing you this Gaussian here at the same scale as the whole image.

13
00:00:35,966 --> 00:00:38,570
So this Gaussian might be 15 by 15 pixels, but

14
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:41,548
it looks really small because we have a good sized image.

15
00:00:41,548 --> 00:00:44,789
But it's get, that would blur the image a little bit.

16
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:48,718
And when I convolve the Gaussian with the original image,

17
00:00:48,718 --> 00:00:53,704
I get exactly what we'd expect, a slightly blurry version of the image.

18
00:00:53,704 --> 00:00:56,909
But look what happens in Fourier space.

19
00:00:56,909 --> 00:01:02,098
The Fourier transform of this tight little Gaussian is this big fat Gaussian.

20
00:01:02,098 --> 00:01:06,637
Remember, we said, small Gaussian in space has a big Gaussian in frequency.

21
00:01:06,637 --> 00:01:10,886
And then we multiply this times this.

22
00:01:10,886 --> 00:01:12,266
And what that's going to do is,

23
00:01:12,266 --> 00:01:15,147
it's going to keep the areas in the middle, which you see here.

24
00:01:15,147 --> 00:01:19,049
But it's going to attenuate the areas on the outside, so

25
00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:21,498
it reduces those low frequencies.

26
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:25,909
And in fact, if I had wanted to, in order to recover this image,

27
00:01:25,909 --> 00:01:30,078
what I could have done was taken the Fourier transform here,

28
00:01:30,078 --> 00:01:34,434
multiplied it by this one, gotten this, and recovered back.

29
00:01:34,434 --> 00:01:36,989
Except that to actually do the recovery,

30
00:01:36,989 --> 00:01:40,274
it wouldn't be enough to just look at the magnitude.

31
00:01:40,274 --> 00:01:43,072
I would actually have to keep the real and imaginary parts.

32
00:01:43,072 --> 00:01:45,695
I'd have to keep the phase of the transform.

33
00:01:45,695 --> 00:01:48,773
But here, I just wanted to show you what happens to the different

34
00:01:48,773 --> 00:01:49,690
frequency power.
