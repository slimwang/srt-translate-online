00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,325
We just said that the degree of return in
a polynomial is the sum of all the

2
00:00:04,337 --> 00:00:08,715
exponents of all the variables in that
term, so the degree is a number. Now

3
00:00:08,727 --> 00:00:13,480
knowing that, I would like you to write in
each of these boxes, what the degree of

4
00:00:13,492 --> 00:00:16,482
the term next to them is. So just fill in
the proper number in each of these blanks.
