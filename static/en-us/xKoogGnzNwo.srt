Congratulations, you're
done with Sunshine.

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:05,990
And along the way, you've learned
how to build an app that runs

3
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:09,539
beautifully in the foreground and
efficiently in the background.

4
00:00:09,539 --> 00:00:13,669
>> And now, you're well equipped to
build Android projects on your own.

5
00:00:13,669 --> 00:00:16,120
>> Of course, there's still more
to learn about Android, and

6
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:17,600
practice makes perfect.

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,580
So as you build projects, it will be
helpful to refer back to these videos or

8
00:00:21,579 --> 00:00:24,039
look at information on
the Android developer website.

9
00:00:24,039 --> 00:00:28,280
>> And there's even an advanced Android
course created by us here at Udacity

10
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:30,750
that can help you explore the next step.

11
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:33,409
>> For now,
great job on completing this course, and

12
00:00:33,409 --> 00:00:34,654
I think it's time to celebrate.

13
00:00:34,655 --> 00:00:36,814
