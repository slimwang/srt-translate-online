1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:02,960
I'm sitting here with Andy Brown, who's
one of the people who heads up a lot of

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:05,220
our education initiatives
here at Udacity.

3
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:09,420
And in fact, not long ago, Andy was kind
of lead on transitioning a lot of what

4
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:12,710
we do at Udacity to a more project-based
approach, to have students completing

5
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:15,720
projects as part of their experience and
learning different skills.

6
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,790
So, thank you so much for
talking to me today,

7
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:19,150
Andy, about project-based learning.

8
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:20,120
>> Yeah, thanks for doing this.

9
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,785
>> So the first thing I want to ask, and
I think this comes up a lot when we're

10
00:00:22,785 --> 00:00:25,324
dealing with teachers who want to
do a project-based approach, but

11
00:00:25,324 --> 00:00:26,662
are very stretched for resources.

12
00:00:26,662 --> 00:00:29,597
Is that project-based learning,
at least in my opinion,

13
00:00:29,597 --> 00:00:33,180
is much more difficult to implement
in a classroom than some traditional

14
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:36,490
instruction of just lecturing or
giving material straight away.

15
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:40,110
Is it worth the extra effort,
and if so why?

16
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:43,311
>> Yes, it's absolutely worth
doing project-based learning.

17
00:00:43,311 --> 00:00:50,040
And now that there's all sorts of free
resources online there's a lot of free

18
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:54,440
time, potentially, for instructors to be
spending their time coming up with and

19
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:58,110
helping their students as they go
through these project activities.

20
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:02,210
There's lots of great explanations, lots
of great sort of static resources out

21
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:05,940
there that, they're going to solve a lot
of the sort of, what am I going to say?

22
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:07,630
How am I going to explain this topic?

23
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:10,120
And, in fact to me that's not
the interesting part of the teaching.

24
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:13,630
The interesting part of the teaching
is how am I going to shepherd

25
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:16,320
this person along as their
brain transforms, and

26
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,400
that's best done through
an authentic project.

27
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,010
So, yes it's totally worth it.

28
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:22,040
It is hard.

29
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,340
>> But it's getting easier.

30
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:24,695
>> But it's getting easier.

31
00:01:24,695 --> 00:01:25,610
>> Yeah.

32
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:27,470
>> This is your job if
you've signed up to it.

33
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:30,990
>> Exactly, I think I've always had
the idea that you just referred to of

34
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:33,930
basically building a course around
all these awesome free materials that

35
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:34,770
are available online.

36
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:38,350
Because there's so much out there
that wasn't out there before, and

37
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:42,090
that led to this class which is
an entire class based largely around

38
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:43,800
the materials that
are already free online.

39
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:47,050
Instead of trying to reinvent the wheel
and represent things that have

40
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:49,930
already been presented very well,
let's just see if we can leverage it and

41
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:54,650
spend our time on kind of the more
student-focused, mentoring and feedback.

42
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:56,090
Speaking of feedback, so

43
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:59,640
one thing that's very difficult I think
in project-based learning is assessment.

44
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,770
When, you know, I have a bunch
of students who all do the same

45
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:02,360
math problem.

46
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,730
I know what the correct answer is.

47
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:04,480
I know what the steps are.

48
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:07,120
And, it's very easy for me to go through
and say, you screwed up step two,

49
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,360
you screwed up step four.

50
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:08,960
>> But so what.

51
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,560
What do you know when you've done that?

52
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,150
>> Yeah, that's true.

53
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:15,000
But yeah assessment in projects
is more difficult, isn't it?

54
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,490
It's a little more open ended.

55
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:21,200
>> It is but it's getting more towards
what you actually want to be measuring.

56
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,560
So yes it's very easy to measure my,

57
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,110
some students ability to factor
ten polynomials correctly.

58
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:29,490
It's just not a very
interesting measurement.

59
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:33,230
Every now and then you'll find things
that can be assessed that way.

60
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:37,260
Or really it's very important to know
these facts before you can move on.

61
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:41,240
But I'm guessing that if you
as an educator ask yourself,

62
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,680
what do I really want?

63
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:45,760
How do I want to change my students with
this learning experience I'm crafting?

64
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:51,500
You'll find it's really hard to
phrase that in terms of some

65
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,580
multiple choice questions or
anything like that.

66
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:54,400
And this is especially

67
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,570
a danger when you're doing
online project based learning.

68
00:02:56,570 --> 00:03:01,360
Because multiple choice questions are by
far the easiest things to do online.

69
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,090
Right, wrong, tally up a score.

70
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:05,350
You have a little green progress bar and
it works.

71
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:10,340
But that experience just is never
going to be even close to what you can

72
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:13,060
get if you try to do
the project based learning.

73
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:13,640
>> Yeah, exactly.

74
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:16,650
And I think that we have, many of
our courses, not our courses, but

75
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:18,160
courses that are currently
available online, or

76
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,100
built around these
multiple choice tests.

77
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,420
But you have exactly that,

78
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:23,960
where often times they have
repeatability built into them.

79
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,810
Which is great,
because you learn from your failures.

80
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:28,370
You get problems wrong,
you move forward and learn.

81
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:31,210
But when you have only a small
set of possible answers,

82
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:34,160
what you're really learning is that
c isn't the answer to that question.

83
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:37,570
You're not learning the deeper
understanding of what's going on there.

84
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:40,570
But for a teacher who has dealing with,
for example in our class,

85
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:44,780
possibly a 100 different projects,
all of which need feedback.

86
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:47,500
Are there any strategies
to how to give feedback in

87
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:50,540
such a way that students can
actually improve on it while doing

88
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:52,930
the project as opposed to just finding
out at the end that they already failed.

89
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:57,980
>> Yeah, if you can bake feedback into
the nature of the project itself.

90
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:01,820
So an example for building an HTML,
a webpage let's say.

91
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:04,170
If you don't know anything
about programming, sorry!

92
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:07,680
If you're building a webpage and I say
build a webpage that looks like this and

93
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,710
I give you a little image
that looks like a webpage.

94
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:11,850
The feedback is pretty natural,

95
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:13,920
the feedback is like well it
doesn't look like that anymore,

96
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,279
you don't need the instructor to come
tell you that, the student knows it.

97
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:21,100
And then if you can set up systems
of feedback within students,

98
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:24,990
you'd be amazed the things
that can happen when you

99
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:27,670
do the terrifying thing of
stepping back as an instructor and

100
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:32,480
just letting your students screw up and
sort of screw up together.

101
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,740
That can be a really amazing
learning experience.

102
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:38,300
There has to be some constraints placed
on that, but you can do it really well.

103
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:44,060
So, yeah, if you find yourself staying
up until 4 AM, frantically grading

104
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:48,395
100 projects, it's probably not ideal,
and you're probably killing yourself.

105
00:04:48,395 --> 00:04:51,220
[LAUGH] So, you're probably not giving
the best feedback to your students that

106
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:54,310
you could,
because nobody could do that And

107
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:57,790
there's probably a more creative
solution that will be just as good.

108
00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:00,110
>> Yeah, it sounds like there are a lot
of ways that we can go about that,

109
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:03,530
like giving exemplars that
a student can, on their own,

110
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:05,230
compare their assignment
to some exemplar.

111
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:07,910
And see where it's different and
where it's similar, maybe

112
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:11,140
building in some automated assessment
through some artificial intelligence.

113
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:13,100
Not just that question was wrong, but

114
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:15,900
something a little bit deeper
about the real nature of learning.

115
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:18,330
And then let the peers
give them feedback on it.

116
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:21,620
I think we often learn best from people
who are going through the same struggles

117
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:23,030
that we're going through.

118
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:25,090
But you mentioned doing this
in the context of web design.

119
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:28,030
I think you're exactly right that we
often talk about project based learning,

120
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:30,890
the context of computer science
because professionally,

121
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:34,140
what we do in computer
science is mostly projects.

122
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:36,390
What about some other
fields like accounting or

123
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:39,410
nursing or,
can't think of another field.

124
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:40,870
But other fields where,

125
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:43,070
it's not necessarily a project
based on what you actually do.

126
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:45,280
Can project based
learning be used there?

127
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:50,320
Or is there something that can be done
that kind of perpetuates the same

128
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,360
philosophical underpinnings
of project based learning.

129
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:56,300
>> I think those fields are still
project based, actually.

130
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:58,680
I think.
I think we've overloaded this word,

131
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,630
project.

132
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:03,120
In computer programming, project can be
what you call the thing you're working

133
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,980
on on the side,
this cool webpage you're building.

134
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:08,970
In project-based learning, the word
project means something very specific.

135
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:11,930
It means an authentic task,
an extended task, so

136
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:14,430
it won't be completed in a single day.

137
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:17,650
It's sort of loosely defined,
so there's room for creativity.

138
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:26,880
And the nurse who is monitoring my
blood glucose levels, that's a project.

139
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:31,540
The accountant who's doing my taxes,
if anyone who wants to do project-based

140
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:33,515
learning and do my taxes,
that'd be good.

141
00:06:33,515 --> 00:06:35,250
>> [LAUGH]
>> But that's a project, right?

142
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:36,130
That's an authentic thing.

143
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:38,520
Like balancing the books on this
company, that's an authentic thing.

144
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,780
So I think projects are there,
if you can find them.

145
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:42,440
>> Yeah.
>> And if they're not,

146
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,170
a computer's probably
doing that job already.

147
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:46,360
>> That's true.
That makes a lot of sense that we,

148
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:49,150
you know, in pure sense we talk about
projects because it's something where

149
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:52,420
I create the idea, I implement it,
I execute it and I deliver it.

150
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:56,110
But you're exactly right,
a project can be anything on going.

151
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:59,500
It's got some investment in it,
but doesn't necessarily have to be

152
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:03,790
completely open to whatever
the student want's to specify.

153
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:06,860
So, this is an educational technology
class and so we're really looking for

154
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:09,910
the ways that we can use
technology to enhance education.

155
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:13,460
Maybe the learning process or
maybe education as a broader community.

156
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:16,570
So specifically on the technology front,
are there things that technology lets

157
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:20,830
us do in project based learning
that are difficult to do in person?

158
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:22,090
>> Let me start by saying the things

159
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:27,070
that technology tempts us to do
that we would never do in person.

160
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:29,180
And that's the things like
the radio button quizzes.

161
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:34,190
The sort of like, oh, I know how to do a
project, and I'm going to have 10 check

162
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:38,550
box quizzes that I'll ask
about how much would you

163
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:42,220
put in this box of my tax return if
you're doing the account in the example.

164
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:43,300
That's not authentic.

165
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:44,450
Nobody thinks it's authentic.

166
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:45,190
It's not fun.

167
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:48,260
It's not a good product base learning.

168
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:51,170
It's a very, like,
superficial substitute.

169
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:55,240
And, it's really tempting to do because
it's so much easier than anything else.

170
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,980
The things that the Internet give you.

171
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:01,380
The Internet gives you scale and
it gives you access, so.

172
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:04,080
I mean it gives you the chance to
have people from across the country,

173
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:08,180
across the world,
working together on a task at any hour.

174
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:08,920
That's pretty cool.

175
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,290
>> Yeah.
>> But, it's a lot of work to set up,

176
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:12,328
and there's a lot of
ways it can go wrong.

177
00:08:12,328 --> 00:08:13,660
>> [LAUGH]
>> So, [LAUGH] I mean,

178
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:17,600
there's tradeoffs for sure, but still,

179
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,590
it's a better way of learning,
if you can find a way to make it work.

180
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:21,470
>> Yeah.
Makes sense, and

181
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:23,420
I think that technology
gives us a lot of ways to,

182
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:26,090
exactly what you're saying,
make it a little bit more open.

183
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:29,620
That it's not necessarily something that
has to happen within the confines of

184
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:32,419
the one hour lecture that we have set
aside for this class three days a week.

185
00:08:32,419 --> 00:08:34,960
It's something that can happen
at three o'clock in the morning

186
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:37,140
when I just happen to be online and
a student asks a question.

187
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:39,169
Or you know there's
a project to review and

188
00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:43,600
I can watch their progress live which I
really have difficulty doing in person.

189
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,390
At Georgia Tech we actually have some
classes that have tried to implement

190
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:47,010
that approach.

191
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:50,190
Where students will come to a lab and
there's no lectures or anything

192
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:52,970
like that, but there is set-aside class
time that they're expected to be there.

193
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:54,040
And the idea is sit there,

194
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:57,530
work on your project, and someone will
be in the room to give you feedback.

195
00:08:57,530 --> 00:09:00,470
But that's a pretty big pragmatic
constraint of they have nine hours

196
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:03,190
a week where they're required to be
in the studio working on a project.

197
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:04,630
During that time.

198
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:07,140
And now we also have a person who
has to be there during that time,

199
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:10,420
whereas the Internet allows us to do
that a little bit more asynchronously.

200
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:13,722
Because it makes
the classroom unlocked 24/7.

201
00:09:13,722 --> 00:09:15,410
So do you have any final thoughts for

202
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:18,690
our students who are both engaging in
project-based learning in this class,

203
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:23,110
and may also be trying to develop tools
that facilitate project-based learning?

204
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:26,280
>> Yeah well, if you're going through
this class, which is itself an example

205
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:30,250
of project-based learning, reflect
on what's going well and what's not.

206
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:33,420
There's learning to
be done just in that.

207
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:36,370
When you go on to try
to do project-based

208
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:37,510
learning in your own classroom.

209
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:40,260
It's hard.

210
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:43,780
You're not going to get
it right to begin with.

211
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:49,230
The bad version will still probably
be better than if you hadn't tried,

212
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:50,660
but it's going to feel chaotic and

213
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:55,330
sort of out of control really,
out of your control.

214
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:58,800
And that's sort of the nature of
project-based learning, is the student's

215
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,800
gain more autonomy, which is
a lot of the reason why we do it.

216
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,180
So stay reflective.

217
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:06,020
Next year will be better.

218
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:08,190
And the next year will
be better than that.

219
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:10,820
And this is how we improve at our craft.

220
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:12,990
>> This is how I justify what I said
at the beginning of this course.

221
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:15,080
Which is that there are some things
that we'll do in this course that will

222
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:15,710
fail miserably.

223
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:17,840
See now I have an expert
saying that's okay.

224
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,910
So.
Thank you so much for

225
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:21,660
talking with us today, Andy,
and for your perspective.

226
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:22,320
And thank you all.
