1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:01,070
Alright, you're done.

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:03,390
Let's take a look at the solution.

3
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:09,050
Hopefully, you added a provider tag
to the Androidmanifest.xml file to

4
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:12,695
register the weather provider
class with the content authority.

5
00:00:12,695 --> 00:00:16,184
The authorities attribute needs to
match the content authority from

6
00:00:16,184 --> 00:00:17,685
the weather contract,

7
00:00:17,685 --> 00:00:22,205
while the name attribute needs to match
the class name of your weather provider.

8
00:00:22,205 --> 00:00:25,565
Note that you don't have to
specify the full package name.

9
00:00:25,565 --> 00:00:28,615
The additional package of the class
is all you need, as I did here.
