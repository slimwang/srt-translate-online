1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Let's go through the answer together.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
When I run this program, we start out with x being 0,

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
and then this while loop says as long as True is true, keep incrementing x.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
So now x is 1, it's 2, it's 3, it's 4, it's 5,

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
and we never actually get to this line about the print.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
So does this program print 0? Not so much.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Control flow goes here, here, here, then back,

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
and we stay in this while loop forever.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
It doesn't print out this huge number 4,294,967,296,

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
which is, I think, pretty close to, let's say, 2 to the 32.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
This is a reasonable guess if you think,

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
"Oh, the integer is going to max out at some value based on computer hardware." But no.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
There's a thought that it raises an exception.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Some badly made Python interpreters might raise an exception on this, but it should not.

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
If we had lots of computing resources, this would run forever.

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
And similarly, it also never prints out -1.

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
The correct answer is none of these things. It loops forever.

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,000
All right. So if this program naturally loops forever and we're writing an interpreter

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
that exactly simulates this program by following all of its steps,

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
our interpreter is also going to loop forever.

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
If someone had written this program in JavaScript

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
and put it in the middle of a web page, our web browser would loop forever

23
00:01:18,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and never actually render the resulting web page.
