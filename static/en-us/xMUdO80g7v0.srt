1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,380
Now recall, that we have actually
talked about five different steps

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:07,650
that are important in
creating a panorama.

3
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:09,790
First, of course,
is being able to capture images.

4
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:11,470
We've looked at how cameras work and

5
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:13,610
how we should be able to
use them to capture images.

6
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:18,190
We'll talk a little bit about it again
here specific to panorama building.

7
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:20,480
Then we have actually
discussed how to detect and

8
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:25,190
match features in images, a pair
of images or a sequence of images,

9
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:27,360
that will allow us to do alignment.

10
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:30,030
Then, of course,
we talk about how we can warp

11
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:35,590
an image to align the images to kind of
have no kinds of ghostly artifacts.

12
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:38,820
Then also, we actually looked
at how we can do blending,

13
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:41,970
both at the frequency level to
be able to kind of merge images,

14
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:44,130
we can fade images, and cut images.

15
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:46,760
The final part, cropping,
you know how to do, it's rather easy.

16
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:51,520
It's basically changing, of course,
the domain of the image itself,

17
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,080
that is finding the range at the,
at the number of columns and

18
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:59,130
number of pixels that we want to
actually use to do cropping.

19
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:02,270
Cropping, of course, is the last step
and it's an optional step to be able to

20
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:07,330
kind of now just create a rectangular
image out of a series of images that we

21
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:11,210
use to build a panorama and in essence,
it's really about finding the right

22
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:14,460
number of rows and columns and the
pixels to create a rectangular image.
