1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:01,780
Whew, that feels good.

2
00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:02,870
We solved everything.

3
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:03,800
>> Not everything.

4
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:06,410
So we handled the two
relatively easy cases,

5
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:09,880
though that second one I admit was
a little bit more of a workout.

6
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:13,285
The next one is going to
be conceptually trickier.

7
00:00:13,285 --> 00:00:15,065
But the algebra's not
going to be much worse and

8
00:00:15,065 --> 00:00:17,555
this is going to be in
the context of reward shaping.

9
00:00:17,555 --> 00:00:20,985
So, have you heard this phrase
Reward Shaping, before?

10
00:00:20,985 --> 00:00:23,035
It comes up often when
people are talking about,

11
00:00:23,035 --> 00:00:27,635
wow, how did they train that
dolphin to jump through a hoop?

12
00:00:27,635 --> 00:00:31,785
So it's tricky to imagine how you might
have gotten a dolphin to jump through

13
00:00:31,785 --> 00:00:36,090
a flaming hoop, out of the water and
then splashing down on the other side.

14
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:38,140
Because it's not the kind of
thing if you were to train it.

15
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:40,380
Well you can't tell it what to do.

16
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:43,736
Because they tend not to
listen unless you go [NOISE].

17
00:00:43,736 --> 00:00:47,920
And you can't reward it just for
having done the right thing.

18
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,270
Because if you've had this flaming hoop
up in the air and you just wait for

19
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:54,039
the dolphin to jump through it and
you give it a treat.

20
00:00:54,039 --> 00:00:56,170
Plus one if it does it and

21
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:58,910
otherwise you don't give it a treat
it's never going to figure that out.

22
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:01,910
It's never going to inadvertently
hop through that hoop and say, hey,

23
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:02,680
do I get a reward?

24
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:07,020
So, how do you suppose they
actually train dolphins to do this?

25
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:09,120
>> I have no idea, but I'm going to
guess about how they do this.

26
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:12,670
Because I'm not as into
dolphins as you apparently are.

27
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:17,420
What I assume that they do is they have
to coax the dolphin to jump through

28
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:23,160
the hoop in the first place, by making
it worth his or her while to do.

29
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:26,640
So you kind of reward it maybe for
jumping first and

30
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,530
then getting near the hoop
without the fire, with the fire.

31
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:34,310
You just keep giving it kind of
rewards for getting close enough until

32
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:36,570
it rather than inadvertently
jumping through the hoop,

33
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:38,470
decides that that must be
the right thing to do now.

34
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:42,360
>> Yeah, I think that's
[LAUGH] some approximation

35
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,920
of what I imagine that they'd do.

36
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,600
My understanding is that they'll
start off with something like

37
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,680
you put the hoop in the water.

38
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:51,490
And you put a fish next to the hoop,
right?

39
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:54,720
So that the dolphin swims over and
eats the fish.

40
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,510
And then you start saying
to the dolphin, well,

41
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:58,660
you start changing when
you pay off the dolphin.

42
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:03,490
You don't give it fish for just touching
the hoop, or for being near the hoop.

43
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:06,800
You give it a fish for
actually touching it with its nose.

44
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,830
And then you lift it out of
the water a little bit, and

45
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:12,440
then it has to swim
faster to get up to it.

46
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,850
And then you lift it out of
the water a little more and

47
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:15,000
it has to jump all the way through.

48
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,860
And then,
yeah once it's all the way at the top

49
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:19,480
eventually you can light
on the fire I guess.

50
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:22,600
I actually don't think I ever seen
a dolphin jump through a flaming hoop.

51
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,210
So we might want to
extinguish some of that.

52
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:26,200
But that's not really the point.

53
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:31,770
The point is that it's this
series of mini rewards

54
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:38,220
along the route to the big payoff that
helps provide the right kind of hints.

55
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:39,640
>> That's cool.

56
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,730
>> I'm going to say life.

57
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:42,250
Like you don't have to
just say grad school.

58
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:44,160
Like most of the things
we do are like this.

59
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,900
We don't wait to

60
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:51,190
get the big reward after we've
inadvertently done the desired behavior.

61
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:52,770
We get hints along the way.

62
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:54,550
>> You've clearly never
met any of my students.

63
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:55,050
But okay.
