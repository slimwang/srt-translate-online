1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,730
We have to go back,
Marty, back to the past.

2
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:04,950
I mean one that persists.

3
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:05,740
>> Hold it.

4
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:08,210
Let's pause for a second and
talk about what persistence and

5
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:09,865
persisting data actually means.

6
00:00:09,865 --> 00:00:13,214
[SOUND]
>> Persistence is saving data to a place

7
00:00:13,214 --> 00:00:14,754
where it can be re-accessed and

8
00:00:14,754 --> 00:00:17,740
retrieved upon restart of the device or
app.

9
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:22,750
This can mean nonvolatile memory on your
device or saving data to remote servers.

10
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:26,350
Persistence is necessary for any app
that wants to store data long term.

11
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:29,130
That is longer than a life
cycle that running app and

12
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:30,350
keep it available to the user.

13
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:36,690
In this course we Fernando, me and
you will go over how persistence works,

14
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:39,140
why it's needed,
what options are available for

15
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:43,200
creating persistent iOS apps and
what the most important ones are.

16
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,320
We'll also add simple persistence
to a recording app, and

17
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,230
work in a completely new app to
level up our persistence skills.

18
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:54,850
You'll see a lot of Eden at the start
and more of me Fernando later on.

19
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:58,070
As course developers here at Udacity
we are here to guide you through

20
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:01,420
the learning process of
iOS app persistence.

21
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:03,130
We'll start with NS user defaults.

22
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:05,710
One of the available options for
persistence.

23
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:10,100
Then in lesson two we'll discuss
the iOS file system and sandboxing.

24
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:13,530
In lesson three, we'll move on to our
second and most important option for

25
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:14,840
persistence, core data.

26
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:17,810
Where we'll talk about pieces
of the core data stack,

27
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:22,180
how to create a data model and how to
make objects from that data model.

28
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:25,820
Lesson four will finish implementing
core data, and see how it

29
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:29,770
actually persists our changes, will see
what happens behind the scenes, and

30
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:33,365
most importantly, what core data
provides beyond persistence.

31
00:01:33,365 --> 00:01:37,620
We'll also learn how to display
core data objects in tables, and

32
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:39,000
collection views.

33
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,440
And in lesson five will dive deeper,
and find out how to search and

34
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,680
filter objects.

35
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,380
And how to migrate our data model,

36
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:50,180
which is vital to know before
uploading an app to the App Store.

37
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:53,940
So let's get started by finding out
how the Doc plans to save Marty's

38
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:55,970
algorithm by using NS user defaults.
