Why do we care about missing data?

2
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:06,320
Let's talk through a couple of points
as to why we should care about missing

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:09,380
data before we complete
an analysis using that data.

4
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:14,380
One of the more basic reasons
we might care about missing data

5
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:17,540
is that some statistical
algorithms just won't work,

6
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:19,340
if there are values
missing from the data.

7
00:00:20,778 --> 00:00:23,760
Obviously, we can't move
forward with an analysis

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,300
if the process we're using
won't get us to the end result.

9
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:31,070
So in those cases, we just have
to deal with the missing data.

10
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:37,030
A second, more subtle reason is that
missing items can add BIAS to a model.

11
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:43,580
Now, the term BIAS in statistics refers
to the tendency of an analysis to

12
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:49,260
either over or under estimate the values
of that specific field or parameter.

13
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:54,410
In other words, if BIAS is present, it
could push the model results higher or

14
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:59,330
lower, depending on how much BIAS there
is in one of the variables we're using.

15
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:01,820
For example,

16
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:06,460
in our hypothetical survey where one
of the questions is related to age.

17
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:10,769
Many older respondents might
be hesitant to give their age.

18
00:01:10,769 --> 00:01:15,826
And if we could actually know what
the real ages of the respondents are,

19
00:01:15,826 --> 00:01:20,716
then we would have a more accurate
picture and one of the facts we would

20
00:01:20,716 --> 00:01:25,547
find is that the average age of
the respondents is really 44.5.

21
00:01:25,547 --> 00:01:29,949
But without the real data there, we
would be working with an average age of

22
00:01:29,949 --> 00:01:34,723
40, depending what our business question
and analysis was trying to solve.

23
00:01:34,723 --> 00:01:37,323
We would be creating downward BIAS.

24
00:01:37,323 --> 00:01:42,023
That is BIAS towards a younger
demographic in our analytic model.

25
00:01:42,023 --> 00:01:43,273
This could effect our results.

26
00:01:43,273 --> 00:01:44,735
And more importantly,

27
00:01:44,735 --> 00:01:49,400
the business decisions could be
made on inaccurate modeling.

28
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:53,130
As a side note if you'd like more
information on the various ways

29
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:57,420
a model process can be affected by BIAS,
