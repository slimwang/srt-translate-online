>> Since we've already covered how xhrGet works as a function, this should be

2
00:00:04,104 --> 00:00:08,640
pretty simplistic. Give in the input to some URI on the internet, do an xhrGET

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:13,517
on it, fetch the data and set this.fullyLoaded=true. This effectively means that

4
00:00:13,517 --> 00:00:17,738
we allow the loading function to occur and when we set this flag, this allows

5
00:00:17,738 --> 00:00:22,160
other external functions to query the class and have logic defined on what to do

6
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,429
or not to do depending on its load state.
