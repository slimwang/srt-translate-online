The last thing I want to mention about this problem is what if, instead, we had

2
00:00:04,863 --> 00:00:09,731
x plus 2 times x? If we take our rectangle and rotate it 90 degrees we can see

3
00:00:09,731 --> 00:00:14,930
that our factors are just along different sides. We have one factor with a side

4
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:19,613
of x plus 2 and the other factor with a side of x. Notice that we would get the

5
00:00:19,613 --> 00:00:24,024
same total area, x squared plus 2x. Again, this is another demonstration of the

6
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:28,659
commutative property of multiplication. The order of the factors doesn't matter.
