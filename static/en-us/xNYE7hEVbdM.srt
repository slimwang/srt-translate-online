1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:04,359
Next you'll be changing the Sunshine
code, and adding a content provider so

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:09,039
that all the data manipulation is
done in a new weather provider class.

3
00:00:09,039 --> 00:00:13,000
Eventually, the main activity would
be calling on that content provider

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,670
to query and display weather
forecasts sorted by date.

5
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:21,800
In the detail activity, we'll still
display one day's weather in detail.

6
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:25,140
This functionality should sound
familiar, and in the next few nodes,

7
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:28,710
you'll be given minimal guidance, as you
build a content provider for Sunshine.
