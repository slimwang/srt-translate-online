00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,548
Whenever we conduct a research study and compute statistical results, we report

2
00:00:03,548 --> 00:00:07,820
those results in something called a Results Section. So, I'm going to outline a

3
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:11,379
little bit what goes into result sections. The first thing we put in our result

4
00:00:11,379 --> 00:00:14,439
sections are descriptive statistics, for example the mean in standard

5
00:00:14,439 --> 00:00:18,726
deviation. The descriptive statistics represent the heart of our study, this

6
00:00:18,726 --> 00:00:23,183
tells us exactly what happened in out study and should always be reported. And

7
00:00:23,183 --> 00:00:27,477
we can report those in three ways. We can report them in text. In other words,

8
00:00:27,477 --> 00:00:31,474
we put them right in, in between our words in our results section. We can put

9
00:00:31,474 --> 00:00:36,200
them in graphs, such as a bar graph. Or we can put them in tables. Next, we'll

10
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:39,673
want to report our inferential statistics. And this is either a hypothesis

11
00:00:39,673 --> 00:00:44,220
test, or a confidence interval, or sometimes both. So when reporting a

12
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:46,785
hypothesis test, you want to give the reader the following pieces of

13
00:00:46,785 --> 00:00:50,710
information. You want to tell the reader, what kind of test did you conduct?

14
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:55,608
For example, a one sample t test. Next, you want to give the actual value of

15
00:00:55,608 --> 00:00:59,415
the test statistic. For example, the value of t. Then, you provide the degrees

16
00:00:59,415 --> 00:01:02,423
of freedom of the test, not the formula, but the actual number that comes from

17
00:01:02,423 --> 00:01:06,996
the formula. You also want to give the reader the p-value, specifically the

18
00:01:06,996 --> 00:01:11,171
exact p-value, if possible. Next, if applicable, give the direction of the

19
00:01:11,171 --> 00:01:16,030
test. For example, is it a one tail test, or a two tail test? And always

20
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:20,002
provide the alpha level. Always let the reader know what alpha level you used,

21
00:01:20,002 --> 00:01:24,453
to make your decision. For many disciplines, we use APA style to report the

22
00:01:24,453 --> 00:01:30,138
results of our hypothesis test. APA stands for American Psychological

23
00:01:30,138 --> 00:01:34,875
Association. The APA has a whole guide on writing research papers and one of

24
00:01:34,875 --> 00:01:40,940
the parts of that guide, tells us how to write inferential statistical results.

25
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:44,216
I'm going to give you a brief introduction to APA style for statistics, as it

26
00:01:44,216 --> 00:01:49,831
relates to the T-test. So, here's a generic outline of how to present the

27
00:01:49,831 --> 00:01:54,496
results of a t test in APA style. First, we put the test statistic name, in

28
00:01:54,496 --> 00:01:59,650
this case it's t. Next to that, we put the degrees of freedom in parentheses.

29
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:03,013
We put an equal sign, then we provide the t value, rounded to two decimal

30
00:02:03,013 --> 00:02:07,931
places with a comma, then we give the p value. Again, rounded to two decimal

31
00:02:07,931 --> 00:02:11,660
places. There are some exceptions in this rule, but for the most part, this is

32
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:14,820
how you do it. And then, we put out the comma and we tell the direction of the

33
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:19,218
test whether it's one tailed or two tailed. I'll give you a more concrete

34
00:02:19,218 --> 00:02:23,875
example in a little bit. Imagine the situation in which we have a t value with

35
00:02:23,875 --> 00:02:28,928
24 degrees of freedom equals negative 2.50. If we're doing it by hand we only

36
00:02:28,928 --> 00:02:32,408
know whether the p value is less than or greater than 0.05, and we have one

37
00:02:32,408 --> 00:02:37,685
tailed test. This is how you'd write it out. If we used a computer to get these

38
00:02:37,685 --> 00:02:43,426
results, we'd end up with an exact p-value. An exact one tailed p-value for

39
00:02:43,426 --> 00:02:49,715
this situation rounded to two decimal places is 0.01. So, in that case, we can

40
00:02:49,715 --> 00:02:51,243
actually put p equals 0.01.
