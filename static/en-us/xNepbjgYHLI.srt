1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,600
Now, before we continue, I would like you to think a little bit about

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:05,190
the implications of what we have just shown.

3
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:08,050
We have just shown that the halting problem is undecidable.

4
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:11,900
What I would like to think about for a moment here is what that means or implies,

5
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:14,520
and I would like you to select the ones that are correct.

6
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:20,010
The halting problem being undecidable, does that mean that an algorithm

7
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:25,490
that solves the halting problem would take far more than exponential time to run,

8
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:30,170
does it mean that an algorithm for this problem here for the halting problem cannot exist

9
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:35,900
or does it mean that if we gave them any specific program and are asked to solve the halting problem

10
00:00:35,900 --> 99:59:59,999
that will never be possible, at least not using an algorithm.
