00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:03,320
In NDB,
most properties are indexed by default.

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:05,470
If your entities have
a lot of properties,

3
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:09,220
indexes can take up a lot more
space than the entities themselves.

4
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:13,835
Unindexed properties also cost fewer
write ops than indexed properties.

5
00:00:13,835 --> 00:00:17,925
If you want to disable indexing for
specific properties, to save some space

6
00:00:17,925 --> 00:00:22,155
in Datastore, you can explicitly disable
indexing when you declare a property.

7
00:00:22,155 --> 00:00:27,905
To do this, when you declare the
property, you'll just add indexed=False.

8
00:00:27,905 --> 00:00:30,647
And, take a look at the documentation
for NDB Property Types,

9
00:00:30,647 --> 00:00:32,473
which is linked in the Instructor Notes.

10
00:00:32,473 --> 00:00:36,515
And, find out which of the following
types are not indexed by default
