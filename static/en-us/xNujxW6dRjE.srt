1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:04,340
Alright, we've got our schema set up. We've got bands, which look up to stages.

2
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:04,890
>> Yep.

3
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:06,700
>> Which look up to festivals. And then we

4
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:09,050
got our attendees hanging out, also looking up to festivals.

5
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:11,710
>> It's all looking good. Maybe we should add a couple band records?

6
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:13,100
>> Yeah, let's make some music happen.

7
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:13,780
>> Let's do it.

8
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:18,460
>> Okay. So I'll go to Setup, and we don't have

9
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:20,780
any band tab up here. What am I going to do, Sam?

10
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,490
>> Yeah, so one of the trade-offs of building in Schema builder, is it

11
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:28,510
doesn't have that little check box to automatically create a new

12
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:32,060
tab. And so we're going to have to do that ourselves by

13
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:35,610
manually getting there in the Setup. But the sidebar on the

14
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:38,140
left is kind of overwhelming. There's a lot of stuff you can

15
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:40,600
click into. But you can use the Quick Find, which is

16
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:43,280
that little search bar in the top over there. And if

17
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,240
you know what you're looking for, like for example, creating a

18
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:48,560
tab, you can just type Tab, and it filters it for you.

19
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:48,840
>> Okay, cool.

20
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,660
>> Okay, so I'll click Create Tabs?

21
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:51,200
>> Sounds good.

22
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,660
>> And I'm guessing New here?

23
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:55,770
>> Yep. So we've been through this drill before.

24
00:00:55,770 --> 00:01:01,280
>> Yeah. This is my favorite decision to make. okay, so.

25
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,870
What do you think? What should the band tab look like?

26
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:04,370
>>

27
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:06,210
>> Music note?

28
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:07,680
>> That sounds good.

29
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,000
>> Okay, and I'm going to hit Next a bunch of times, I'm sure.

30
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,180
>> Default Visibility on. Sounds good.

31
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:16,140
>> Okay, I

32
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:19,300
don't want it to be available to all these silly default apps.

33
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:21,080
>> Right, just the festival app.

34
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,710
>> Okay. Cool. Okay, we've got bands up here. So

35
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:27,620
now I can add a record. okay, now. Add a band,

36
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:31,130
and all it has is name.

37
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:33,510
>> So that's the other trade-off with building in

38
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:37,740
Schema Builder. it's not automatically added to the page layout.

39
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:39,122
>> What isn't? Like, the fields, all of those

40
00:01:39,122 --> 00:01:39,499
[CROSSTALK]?

41
00:01:39,499 --> 00:01:41,580
>> All of the fields that we created, yeah. So

42
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:43,890
let's just create a band. So just pick any random

43
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:46,010
name that you want, or I guess not random, pick

44
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:47,460
a band that you want to play at our festival.

45
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:48,970
>> Okay, I don't know. Who do

46
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:51,680
you like? Changed slightly for copyright purposes.

47
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:51,680
>>

48
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,542
[LAUGH]

49
00:01:52,542 --> 00:01:57,800
>> Let's do U3, my favorite band. So we've got our band, U3, and it

50
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:02,060
doesn't have the fields like genre and all that. But we can add them, I hope.

51
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:05,700
>> So, if we ever wanted to modify the page layout, like adding fields

52
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:08,960
or even moving fields around, taking them off, whatever you want to do. You can

53
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:12,410
either do that from the Object Setup Detail page in Setup, or easily from

54
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:15,090
the page right here in the top right hand corner where it says Edit Layout.

55
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:15,190
>> Okay.

56
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:17,210
>> So.

57
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:17,950
>> those

58
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:19,770
are my fields, I want them. Genre, headliner.

59
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:21,160
>> There you go. Right now we're looking

60
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,190
at the Page Layout editor in Setup. And

61
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:26,520
we have all of our fields, or if we made custom buttons, or maybe had other

62
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:29,840
lists that we wanted to show, we could drag all of those into the page layout.

63
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,690
So why don't you grab a couple of your fields, and then put them onto the page?
