00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,170
As we saw so far, the interactions between the kernel and

2
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:07,930
the user-level library involve requesting, allocating, and scheduling threads.

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,710
And this you may assume there's some number of threads allocated at

4
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:16,020
startup to get the operating system to boot.

5
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:19,300
So as a quick quiz, answer the following questions.

6
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:22,060
First, in the Linux kernel's codebase,

7
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:26,540
what is the minimum number of threads that are needed to allow a system to boot?

8
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:30,940
Second, what is the name of the variable that's used to set this limit?

9
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:35,550
Each of these questions can be answered by examining the source code of

10
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:36,800
the Linux kernel.

11
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,795
And please refer to the Instructors Notes for some useful pointers.
