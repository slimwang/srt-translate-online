00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:05,253
So far we have discussed a number
of technical solutions to deal with

2
00:00:05,253 --> 00:00:06,489
cyber threats.

3
00:00:06,489 --> 00:00:09,638
But these solutions have to
be considered in a context of

4
00:00:09,638 --> 00:00:11,530
an organization.

5
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:15,080
For example, what are my cyber assets?

6
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:17,472
What kind of risks do they face?

7
00:00:17,472 --> 00:00:22,052
Do the technical solutions really
reduce this risk significantly?

8
00:00:22,052 --> 00:00:25,660
Are there people and process issues?

9
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:30,980
These topics come under what we
call managing cyber security,

10
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:34,670
and cyber security management is
going to be the focus of this lesson.
