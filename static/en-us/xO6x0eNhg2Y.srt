00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:02,360
Here's our food router, and

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:05,190
here's the call to start
monitoring the app's history.

3
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:07,670
Inside food router is
the list of routes and

4
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:10,260
the functions to call when
those routes are visited.

5
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:14,160
When the URL changes to /clear,
call the clear function.

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,430
Let's add a breakpoint where we
create the new foodRouter router,

7
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:20,760
then refresh the page, which will
pause right at the breakpoint.

8
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,210
Let's step through how
everything gets set up.

9
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:26,798
This calls the parent Router class,
sets up some options,

10
00:00:26,798 --> 00:00:28,465
and then binds the routes.

11
00:00:28,465 --> 00:00:31,900
_bindRoutes is the important
function in all of this.

12
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:35,450
It gets the route from the foodRouter
router and starts cycling through them.

13
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:41,720
It takes the last route, passes it and
its callback to the route function.

14
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:45,540
The route function takes the route and
converts it into a regular expression.

15
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:49,630
This regular expression will be used
later when matching the browser's URL.

16
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:51,290
If the callback is a string and

17
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:55,530
not a function itself, it gets
the function from the foodRouter object.

18
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:59,250
It then calls Backbone.history.route,
passing it the route and

19
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:00,860
a callback function.

20
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:05,019
This function will be called later, but
see here that our original callback

21
00:01:05,019 --> 00:01:08,080
function will be executed
when this function gets run.

22
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,901
Backbone.history.route adds
the route and

23
00:01:10,901 --> 00:01:13,730
the callback to its list of handlers.

24
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:16,990
Then we just work our way back to bind
routes, and do all that again for

25
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:17,585
the next route.
