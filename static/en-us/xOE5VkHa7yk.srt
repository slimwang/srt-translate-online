1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:05,308
N plus two divided by the quantity three M plus fifteen is correct. Nice work

2
00:00:05,308 --> 00:00:09,406
for getting either of these correct. We'll start by finding the lowest common

3
00:00:09,406 --> 00:00:13,957
denominator for these two fractions. We'll find the common factors for N plus

4
00:00:13,957 --> 00:00:19,826
five. And m plus two. Make sure that you don't put a single m here. They have a

5
00:00:19,826 --> 00:00:24,790
term of m, but they don't have a common factor of m. And it's because we have

6
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:29,948
addition between each of these terms. Multiplying by the L-C-D divided by the

7
00:00:29,948 --> 00:00:35,120
L-C-D, we can see that the factors that m plus five cancel out. These equal one.

8
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:40,909
Likewise, in the denominator of the complex fraction M plus 2 divided by m plus

9
00:00:40,909 --> 00:00:46,523
2 equals 1. This leaves us with 3 times m plus 2 for our numerator. And 9 times

10
00:00:46,523 --> 00:00:51,180
m plus 5 for our denominator. We can simplify these numbers, since they're

11
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:56,427
factors that appear in the numerator and denominator. 3 9ths reduces to 1 3rd.

12
00:00:56,427 --> 00:01:02,826
We just divide each number by 3. Finally we distribute our 3 to get n plus 2

13
00:01:02,826 --> 00:01:06,803
divided by 3m plus 15, our final answer.
