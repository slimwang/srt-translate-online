00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:03,140
Now that we've given you an overview
of what you'll work on in the iOS

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:06,120
nanodegree, it's time to figure out
if right now is a good time for

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:06,950
you to start the program.

4
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:10,690
To do that, you'll take the readiness
assessment, which you can get to from

5
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:12,970
your nanodegree portal or
from the instructor notes here.

6
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:15,640
>> Before we start
the readiness assessment,

7
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,540
take a second to start
downloading Xcode,

8
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:19,690
Apple's free development environment.

9
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:22,220
All of the development work in
the nanodegree will take place

10
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:23,270
right in Xcode.

11
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:26,430
It'll be our text editor, our interface
builder, our build environment,

12
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:29,090
our testing harness,
even our research tool.

13
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:30,540
It's a great development environment,
and

14
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:33,550
Apple has poured a lot of attention
into it in the last year.

15
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:35,620
You can download it for
free on the OS 10 App Store.

16
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:38,900
You'll see a link in
the instructor's notes on this page.

17
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:41,140
It's a big download, so
we recommend starting it now so

18
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:43,150
you can jump into writing
code as soon as possible.
