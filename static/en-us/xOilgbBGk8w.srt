[Thrun] This very final episode of the computer vision classes

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I will teach you about structure from motion.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
This is a really funny name for something much more intuitive,

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
and it comes from the early days of computer vision

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
where the structure referred to the 3D world.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
And of course it's impossible to capture the 3D world with the camera itself

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
because the camera only gives 2D projections of the 3D scene.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Motion referred to the locations of the camera.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:34,000
So the idea was to take a handheld camera and move it around a 3D structure

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
and be able to recover or estimate the 3D coordinates of all the features in the world

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
based on many 2D images.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
So suppose you have a scene with 3 features--A, B, and C--

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
and you're moving a camera around to different positions--1, 2, and 3.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Then the different features get projected onto different points in the camera planes,

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
as shown over here.

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
And from the positions of those projected features

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
it may be impossible to recover not just where the camera was

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
at the time these images were taken but also where in the world the features are.

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
That's called structure from motion.

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
So here is my first quiz.

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Is this possible?

22
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Given that we look at a number of features in the scene--

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
maybe 1, maybe 2, maybe more--

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
and given that we have 1 or more camera positions,

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:33,000
can we always, sometimes, or never recover or calculate the 3D position of the features

26
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
and the 3D position of the cameras simultaneously?

27
00:01:36,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Please check almost, sometimes, or never.
