1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:05,000
So let's go through some of
these Gestalt Principles.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,210
The first is the Law of Past Experience.

3
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:11,230
Early apps and
mobile platforms took advantage of this

4
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:14,260
by sowing you digital versions of
things from the physical world,

5
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:18,320
like notepads, stop watches,
and weekly planners.

6
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,890
The lines on the paper of a notepad app

7
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:24,170
are sometimes referred to
as skeuomorphic details.

8
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:27,800
They're ornamental decorations that
can make the UI feel a little more

9
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,280
comfortable and familiar to the user.

10
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:33,810
As mobile devices became more and
more prevalent, it became less and

11
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:36,920
less useful to incorporate
these kinds of details.

12
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:39,870
People became more and
more comfortable using apps that

13
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:43,240
didn't exactly look like their
real world counterparts.

14
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:45,280
And how about the Law of Proximity?

15
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,670
Returning to the example from our quiz,

16
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:53,000
these boxes representing text are close
to these circles that are likely images.

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,370
They're closeness tells us instinctively
that they must be related.

18
00:00:57,370 --> 00:01:00,218
The text is probably the label for
the image.

19
00:01:00,218 --> 00:01:03,410
Even without knowing what each
item says, we won't mistake

20
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:08,190
the relation between this and
this with something like this and this.

21
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:12,820
We can also recognize that these
three items are close to each other

22
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:14,300
while the others aren't.

23
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:17,530
This helps us further visually
deconstruct what's going on in

24
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:19,020
this screen.

25
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:22,890
Finally, we can take this a step
further with the Law of Similarity, and

26
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:27,370
recognize that each of the items in
this list must represent similar things

27
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:29,340
because they look basically the same.

28
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:33,070
The cool thing is, all we did here to
set up these relationships was use

29
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:35,110
white space to our advantage.

30
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:38,480
Adding more space between elements
separated them both visually and

31
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,860
conceptually.

32
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:43,120
Tightening the space between
elements help them feel more related

33
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:43,780
to one another.
