I know that you've been absolutely dying to see the graph of our famous

2
00:00:03,258 --> 00:00:07,930
reverberation time function. So here it is, now notice that I've ignored the

3
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:12,159
restrictions brought on by the application. That's going to let us look at the

4
00:00:12,159 --> 00:00:16,146
function as a whole. Otherwise we'd only be looking at these positive values of

5
00:00:16,146 --> 00:00:20,645
x, and that wouldn't be quite as interesting. What are the domain and the range

6
00:00:20,645 --> 00:00:25,320
of the entire function T? I've given you 2 options for each. You can either say

7
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:28,792
that the domain of the range is all the real numbers, or you can say that it's

8
00:00:28,792 --> 00:00:34,345
all the real numbers, except for certain values. If you pick the second option,

9
00:00:34,345 --> 00:00:39,099
I'd like you to fill in those values that either X or T cannot equal.
