1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
In a web or mobile product, instead of building a physical prototype,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
you need to have a low fidelity app or website available for customer feedback.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
What does low fidelity mean?

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Well that's just kind of my description of you don't need an entire finished website

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
but you should at least have a wireframe.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
And if you don't have a wireframe, you should at least have a PowerPoint of mockups

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
or a flash demo or something so people could see not only what you're describing in words

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
but actually could say, "Oh I get it!"

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Now remember, don't demo that first. Your goal here is to first understand the problem.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
And I make people sometimes who would like to give demos to leave all that stuff home

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
when you're first having the problem discussion.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
But the minute you get into well would something like this solve your problem for a web/mobile app

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
you really want to get feedback on a low fidelity app as quickly as possible.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
And when we teach this as a class, literally by the second week of the class,

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
if you're building a web and mobile app you have to have your site or wireframe up and running

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
so people can actually see it and give you feedback.

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Later on, you're going to build what I call the high fidelity app

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
and that tests your understanding of the solution.

19
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
This actually has most of the features. It might not have health files.

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
The graphics might not be complete but a high fidelity app gives you more resolution

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
and we really didn't like that color, the button was in the wrong place, etc.

22
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
This helps you avoid building products no one wants,

23
00:01:29,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and it maximizes the learning per time spent on the product and on customers.
