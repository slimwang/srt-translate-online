We need to put a little n next to our radical sign to show the nth root of x or

2
00:00:04,964 --> 00:00:09,762
x to the 1 over n power. So if we write the 5th root of x for example, that's

3
00:00:09,774 --> 00:00:14,664
just equal to x to the 1 5th, and similarly, for the 8th root of x. Square roots

4
00:00:14,676 --> 00:00:19,253
then, are the one xception to our rule. It's like there's an invisible two

5
00:00:19,572 --> 00:00:23,211
written next to the radical sign here, but according to convention, we just

6
00:00:23,223 --> 00:00:25,102
don't write any number for square roots.
