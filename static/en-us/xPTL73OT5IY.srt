1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
All right. Let's go ahead and try this here,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
and we'll play around with it in our browser.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
So right now, these 3 radio buttons have 3 different names.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Let's give them all the same name--so instead of being "q", "r", and "s",

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
we're going to make them "q", "q", and "q".

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Okay. We Save this,

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
we go to our browser

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
and Reload the page.

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Now we have our 3 radio buttons again.

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
And now, when I select the first one, it behaves as we expected.

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
And I select the second one,

12
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
and it will unselect the first one--so that's cool.

13
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
So now we can only select one option

14
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
and things work as we expected.

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
And when I submit the form, we see that: q=on

16
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
because that was the name of the inputs.

17
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
A major downside to this is that,

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
no matter which radio button I selected,

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
"q" still says it's equal to "on".

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
So that's not particularly helpful because we want to know

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
which radio button is selected.

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Well, that is what the value parameter is for,

23
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
and let's take a look at that.

24
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Here we are in our Editor again, and we're going to learn

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
about another parameter--this one's called "value".

26
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
So I'm going to add a value parameter to each of these inputs.

27
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'll make the first one be "one"

28
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
and I'll make the second one be "two"--

29
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
and I'll make the third one be "three".

30
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
So now we have: type="radio" name="q"--for all 3 of these,

31
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
but the first radio button has the value "one",

32
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
a second has value "two", and the third one has value "three".

33
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Let's go ahead and try this out in our browser.

34
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Okay. I've reloaded the form

35
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
and now I'm going to select one of these radio buttons.

36
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Let's go with the second one, and I would like you to tell me

37
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
what happens when I click Submit.

38
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
So what will the value of the "q" parameter in the URL be

39
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
when the form is submitted with the second radio button selected?
