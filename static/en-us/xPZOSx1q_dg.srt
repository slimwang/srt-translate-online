00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,950
The process of the browser creating and

2
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:07,200
building the document object model can be fairly complicated.

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,480
But if we're going to be precise about things,

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:14,890
it happens during the page load as it receives HTML source.

5
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:19,520
So, even before the page is fully loaded, the browser begins to

6
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:23,680
start constructing the document object model one piece at a time.

7
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:29,210
Other answers I would consider correct, are simply after HTML's been received,

8
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:30,656
or after the page has been loaded.

9
00:00:30,656 --> 00:00:37,040
For part b, while the DOM can be accessed through a variety of different means,

10
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,020
the main answer I was looking for

11
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:42,910
is through its JavaScript application programming interface since we're

12
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:47,100
going to be working in the browser and with JavaScript in this course.

13
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:51,520
And in the third part, while you can access the DOM through JavaScript,

14
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:56,350
as I just mentioned, the DOM itself isn't a programming language,

15
00:00:56,350 --> 00:01:01,950
or JavaScript, but is merely a specification of an interface.

16
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:07,150
The DOM is also a hierarchical object, and what I mean by this is that it has

17
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:12,620
a tree structure and this is due to the nested nature of HTML itself.
