00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,997
Let's talk about signs for a second. For real numbers, we have 3 different

2
00:00:03,997 --> 00:00:07,882
cases. Every real number is either negative, 0, or positive. Now since

3
00:00:07,882 --> 00:00:12,106
discriminants are made of real numbers, assuming that the coefficients of our

4
00:00:12,106 --> 00:00:16,475
quadratic equation are real, then they had to fall into these 3 categories. Each

5
00:00:16,475 --> 00:00:21,031
of these types of discriminants matches a certain number of roots Of a parabola,

6
00:00:21,031 --> 00:00:25,315
or in other words, a certain number of solutions to our quadratic equation,

7
00:00:25,315 --> 00:00:29,937
which we can of course find by our quadratic formula, using the disciminate. So

8
00:00:29,937 --> 00:00:34,353
here are 3 types of discriminates, and which type do you think produces 2 real

9
00:00:34,353 --> 00:00:38,838
roots, which type do you think produces 1 real root, and which type do you think

10
00:00:38,838 --> 00:00:40,363
produces no real roots?
