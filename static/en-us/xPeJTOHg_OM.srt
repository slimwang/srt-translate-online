00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:05,032
Here's an example from Sivic and
Zisserman in ICCV.

2
00:00:05,032 --> 00:00:09,483
And the idea is that here we've carved
up feature space, sift or otherwise,

3
00:00:09,483 --> 00:00:13,454
and the idea is that I've got in
this particular case three different

4
00:00:13,454 --> 00:00:14,720
code words.

5
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:15,950
Here's a particular example.

6
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:18,570
So they are brought in from real images.

7
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:22,772
So you see one of the code words that
was found, I'm going to draw an example,

8
00:00:22,772 --> 00:00:26,790
is basically a dark patch with a light
thing sticking out of the corner.

9
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:29,900
And these are taken from
lots of different images.

10
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:32,490
So that's like the eyeballs
that we saw before.

11
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:37,880
And the idea is that all of the points
here are an example of that.

12
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:39,500
So you could just say,

13
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:42,800
how many of these code words
show up in a particular picture?
