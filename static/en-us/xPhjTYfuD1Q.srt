1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:02,190
Let's do the first task.

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:07,473
We're going to rename the number input
parameter to have a different name.

3
00:00:07,473 --> 00:00:11,210
This is the first input parameter,
int number,

4
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:15,236
and all I need to do is just
change the variable name.

5
00:00:15,236 --> 00:00:16,736
I'm going to change this to,
for example, numberOfCoffees.

6
00:00:16,736 --> 00:00:17,735
It can be any name that you want.

7
00:00:17,735 --> 00:00:23,290
Now, I immediately see a warning and
an error.

8
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:27,030
The warning says, the parameter
numberOfCoffees is never used,

9
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:31,530
because nowhere in this method
do I use this variable.

10
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:35,090
Then I see that there's an error that
says, cannot resolve symbol number.

11
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:36,890
Now, there's no variable called number.

12
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:38,550
There's no local variable called number.

13
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:40,580
There's no global
variable called number.

14
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:42,790
And it's not an input parameter, either.

15
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:46,930
instead, I need to switch this so
that it's called numberOfCoffees.

16
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:48,040
And there you go, that fixed the error.

17
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,248
So I'm going to run it on my device now.

18
00:00:49,248 --> 00:00:51,640
And this is what it looks like.

19
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:54,060
The quantity picker works as expected.

20
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:57,810
There should be no visible change to
the user because we just modified

21
00:00:57,810 --> 00:00:59,510
the name of an input parameter.

22
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:04,200
Also, we didn't have to change the way
that the method is being called.

23
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:08,100
We can still say displayQuantity and
then pass in anything we want.

24
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:11,540
It doesn't matter to the caller
what this input parameter name is.

25
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:16,270
The second task is to change
the data type of the input parameter

26
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:17,370
from int to string.

27
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:22,600
So in the display quantity method,
I'm going to change the input so

28
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:29,040
that instead of a integer data type, it
expects a string data type, like this.

29
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,125
And now,
there's a couple errors in our app.

30
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:35,495
When I scroll up, I see that
there is a red squiggly underline

31
00:01:35,495 --> 00:01:38,025
in the increment method and
in the decrement method.

32
00:01:38,025 --> 00:01:39,496
The error message says,

33
00:01:39,496 --> 00:01:44,130
displayQuantity string in MainActivity
can't be applied to something int.

34
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:48,960
What it's saying is that we can't
pass the quantity variable into

35
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,560
the method anymore because this is
an integer, and it's expecting a string.

36
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:58,320
This mismatch in data type
is causing an error, and

37
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,810
the app won't even run on our device.

38
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:02,050
This is a compile time error.

39
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,780
There's a couple ways to fix this.

40
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:08,558
Either we have to change what's
being passed into the method so

41
00:02:08,558 --> 00:02:10,494
that this is actually a string.

42
00:02:10,494 --> 00:02:14,246
I could put 100 here and put it in
double quotes so that it's a string, and

43
00:02:14,246 --> 00:02:17,210
that would match the right
input type here.

44
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:20,300
But what we really want is for
quantity to still be an integer so

45
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:24,220
that we can do math on it to increase
it by one or decrease it by one.

46
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:27,380
So I'm going to leave this as quantity.

47
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:29,670
And then this should be
changed to be an integer.

48
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:32,740
And then our app should work again.

49
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:34,980
Cool.
So so

50
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:39,100
far, we've seen an example of
a method with one input parameter.

51
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:43,370
But what about examples of methods
with zero input parameters, or

52
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:45,050
two input parameters, or more?
