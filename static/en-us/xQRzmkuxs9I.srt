1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:04,200
Now, we can use this equation and make a substitution. We can replace the

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:09,114
quantity x squared with a different variable that we'll call u. So, here

3
00:00:09,114 --> 00:00:14,010
instead of having x squared, we'll have the value u and we'll square it. Here

4
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:18,942
we'll have minus 13 times u to the first power. Again, here replacing x squared

5
00:00:18,942 --> 00:00:25,068
with our substitution of u. We're turning our non quadratic equation into one

6
00:00:25,068 --> 00:00:29,554
that is quadratic. So now that we've got this quadratic, let's see if we can

7
00:00:29,554 --> 00:00:33,955
solve it. What do you think are the solutions for this equation. Keep in mind

8
00:00:33,955 --> 00:00:38,710
that you're solving this equation for u. We aren't solving for x, which was the

9
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:43,880
original variable in our original equation. We'll come back to that later. When

10
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:47,150
you have the answers for u, enter them here. Good luck.
