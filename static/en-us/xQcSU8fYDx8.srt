00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
And here is my answer.

00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
There are a number of ways to do this, but a simple one is to take the old mean,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
multiply it by the number of observations, which gets us the sum,

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
add to it the new value, which gets us the new sum,

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
and then divide it by the new number of observations,

6
00:00:15,000 --> 99:59:59,999
which is just one more than the old one.
