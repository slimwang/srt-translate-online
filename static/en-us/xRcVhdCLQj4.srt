1
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:04,220
Customer wants to buy something,
company wants to sell something,

2
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:05,660
what's sitting in between them?

3
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:06,580
A form.

4
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:10,280
If you think about registration,
a company wants to grow their user base,

5
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:13,660
someone wants to be part of that
community, or product or they have.

6
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:15,650
And again what's between them is a form.

7
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:18,850
So in all these places where
this connection happens

8
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:21,480
between the organizations that
make things on the internet, and

9
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,220
the people that use those things,
there's generally a form.

10
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:27,730
And those forms as you say
consist of input fields.

11
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:32,210
The biggest mistake that i think people
make is treating those things from

12
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:35,500
what I would call almost
a back end perspective.

13
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:39,560
That is inside of a database,
to simplify things, you have these name

14
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:42,800
value pairs, right, name and
then a field for what the name is.

15
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,260
And you've got a whole
bunch of these things and

16
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:48,500
they constitute something like
the record of a user, or a purchase.

17
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:51,710
And when it comes time to collect
that information to fully fill in

18
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:55,210
that database, what you do is you just
spit out those name value pairs as input

19
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:56,530
fields and labels.

20
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:59,810
And ta-da, job done with a form.

21
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:04,650
So both of these things I learned
almost the hard way, if you will,

22
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:07,730
at eBay about how to think
about them differently.

23
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:12,960
When I was at Ebay many years ago it was
the 28th largest economy in the world.

24
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,680
So lots and lots of people buying and
selling things on there.

25
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:20,440
And we found that when we made small
changes to these forms we could really

26
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,870
have a huge impact.

27
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:24,740
In fact when we redesigned
the registration form process,

28
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:26,480
we had to go back to Wall Street and

29
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:30,160
restate earnings because that was
how tremendous the impact was.

30
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:35,230
And when you think about the ability for
something like a form to impact

31
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:38,980
something like the 28th largest economy
in the entire planet, you really start

32
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:43,410
to understand the importance of all
the little details in the forms.

33
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:47,600
And that goes well beyond which
name value pairs you include.

34
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,380
How you put the labels in,
what kind of form control you use,

35
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:54,350
what kind of feedback you give to people
as they're filling in this information.

36
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:56,240
How do you organize it?

37
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,515
What do you do to message the before and
after parts of the form?

38
00:01:59,515 --> 00:02:01,650
because it's a part of a broader flow.

39
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:05,442
And so the biggest mistake is really not
considering that full envelope of form

40
00:02:05,442 --> 00:02:10,169
design, and really just regurgitating
a database's fields onto a screen and

41
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:11,560
putting a submit button on the bottom
