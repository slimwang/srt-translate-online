1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:05,150
As another example, the attacker can
also hide part of the attack and

2
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:08,050
cause the IDS to miss
detecting the attack.

3
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:11,650
For example,
by sending fragments that overlap,

4
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:16,630
the IDS may discard a fragment that
overlaps with a previous fragment.

5
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:19,300
While the end host may accept both.

6
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:22,980
Again, the result is that,
the IDS will miss the attack.

7
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:26,470
Here's an illustration
of this evasion attack.

8
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:29,910
Again, the attackers sends
a packet although out of order,

9
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:34,650
both the end host and
the IDS will assemble them in order.

10
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:38,680
However, the two As here
are overlapping fragments.

11
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:44,870
The IDS drops the second A, so therefore
the IDS only sees A, T, T, C, K.

12
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:49,748
On the other hand, the end-host accepts
both fragments even though they overlap,

13
00:00:49,748 --> 00:00:54,370
therefore the end-host sees A,
T, T, A, C, K.

14
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:57,970
In other words, the end-host gets
attacked by the traffic, yet

15
00:00:57,970 --> 00:00:59,510
the IDS misses the attack.
