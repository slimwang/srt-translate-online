1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:05,000
We can think of a spectrum of similarity. At one end of the spectrum,

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,470
the target problem and the source case are identical.

3
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:12,000
At the other extreme end of the similarity spectrum, the target problem and

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,820
the source case have nothing in common. We can evaluate the similarity between

5
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:20,750
the target problem and source case in similar dimensions. In terms of

6
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:24,050
the relationships occurring in the source case and the target problem.

7
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:27,173
In terms of the objects occurring between the two. In terms of the features of

8
00:00:27,173 --> 00:00:31,470
the objects and in terms of the values that the features of the objects take.

9
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:34,150
At the end of the spectrum, where the target problem and

10
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:37,750
the source case are very similar, with relationships, objects, features, and

11
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:42,750
values are all similar. At the other end the values, features and

12
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:45,640
objects may be different, but the relationships are similar.

13
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:49,330
If the relationships too are different, then there'll be nothing in common with

14
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:52,930
the target problem in the source case. When the relationships, objects,

15
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:57,600
features and values are all similar, then that is an example of recording cases,

16
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,500
and we have come across it. An example of that was from the colored blocks in

17
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,750
the blocks world. When the similarity between the target problem and

18
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:09,170
the source case is along the dimension to relationships and objects, but not

19
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:13,315
along the dimensions of values or values and features, then that's an example of

20
00:01:13,315 --> 00:01:17,390
case-based reasoning. We discuss this method in the domain of navigation and

21
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:21,320
urban areas. The objects of the concept between the target problem and

22
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:24,400
the source case being the same means that the domains are the same.

23
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,930
So cased-based reasoning is within domain analogy. An analogical reasoning in

24
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:32,730
general, objects in the target column and the source case too,

25
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:36,762
might be different. We saw an example of analogical reasoning in the Dunker

26
00:01:36,762 --> 00:01:41,160
radiation problem, when we were talking about cross-domain analogical transfer.

27
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:44,200
Actually recording cases in case based reasoning are also examples of

28
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:47,110
analogical reasoning, except that they occur in the same domain.

29
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:49,690
The target firm and the source cases in the same domain,

30
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:53,906
which is why we consider them earlier. By analogical reasoning here,

31
00:01:53,906 --> 00:01:58,190
we mean cross domain analogical transfer. As in the Dunker radiation problem.
