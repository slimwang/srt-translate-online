00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
One of the interesting thing about a startup is how is your company going to be organized?

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
What we now know is the most efficient way to think about

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
all the pieces just all the parts is by a business model.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
And so the next question is okay, Steve just told me think about a business model

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
but what is a business model?

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
What are all the pieces? Well let's take a look.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
A business model is how a company creates values for itself

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
while delivering products or services for its customers.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Now if you think about it, in the old days we think about

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
how to organize a company around functional organizations.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
We think no, a company is about its sales department or its engineering department

12
00:00:41,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and you would draw a work chart but now where going to draw a very different diagram.
