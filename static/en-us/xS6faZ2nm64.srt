00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,512
Now, we're at our final step in coming up with an equation for Grant. So, we can

2
00:00:04,524 --> 00:00:09,024
eventually help him figure out how much it cost to make one wiper set. We have

3
00:00:09,036 --> 00:00:13,561
four equations up here in our what we know section. And that may look like a lot

4
00:00:13,573 --> 00:00:18,266
if information to handle at once, but using substitution, we can pretty easily

5
00:00:18,278 --> 00:00:22,810
create one equation that involves all of these things. So look at this equation

6
00:00:22,822 --> 00:00:27,015
right here, the last word equation we came up with, and think about how these

7
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:31,145
pieces of information fit in here. Substitute them into the right spots, and

8
00:00:31,157 --> 00:00:33,505
then type your final equation into this box.
