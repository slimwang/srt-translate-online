1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Okay. So here we are in our Editor again, and this is the basic HTML file

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
we were editing before and that we were opening in our browser.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
We're going to go back to this a little bit so we can learn

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
some new form elements.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
So the first thing I'm going to do is remove the Action parameter

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
from the Form element so that we can submit

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
the form to itself and we'll see the "q" parameter in the URL again.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
This makes it easy to demonstrate what's going on,

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
without having to go back to our app Server and all of that stuff.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
So I removed that; let's go to our browser and let's give this form a test.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
So I reload the page,

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I type in: "some junk" here,

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
which it autocompletes for me.

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I click Submit,

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
and we see "some junk" in the URL:

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
q=some+junk.

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Okay. Let's go back to our Editor.

18
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
So here we are in our Editor.

19
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
One thing that I'm leaving off is the Type parameter on this first input.

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
So let's go ahead and add that:

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
type="text"--

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
type="text" is the default type of an input parameter.

23
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I didn't include it originally because I didn't want to

24
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
spend a whole lot of time talking about that, at the time.

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
But in reality, we want to be a little bit more specific with our types,

26
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
especially now that we're going to learn some new types.

27
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
So if I change that to type "text" the behavior won't change in the browser.

28
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
And the first thing we're going to do is learn a new type.

29
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
So instead of being "text"

30
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
we're going to change this to "password".

31
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
The "password" type is useful for entering passwords in a text box.

32
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Okay--so here we are in our browser.

33
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Now when we type some text into the box here,

34
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
it appears as dots instead of the actual text.

35
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
So for the next quiz, what I'd like you to do is

36
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
tell me what happens when I click the Submit button.

37
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
You can try this out on your own, at home.
