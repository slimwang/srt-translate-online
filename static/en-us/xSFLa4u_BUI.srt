00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,830
In congestion collapse, an increase in traffic load

2
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:07,510
suddenly results in a decrease of useful work done.

3
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:12,890
As we can see here, up to a point, as we increase network load, there is an

4
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:15,730
increase in useful work done. At some point,

5
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:19,650
the network reaches saturation, at which point increasing the

6
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:23,140
load no longer results in useful work getting done.

7
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:25,490
But at some point, actually increasing the traffic load

8
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:31,170
can cause the amount of work done or the amount of traffic forwarded to actually

9
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:34,320
decrease. There are many possible causes. One possible

10
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,110
cause is the spurious re-transmissions of packets that

11
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:40,150
are still in flight. So when senders

12
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:43,120
don't receive acknowledgements for packets in a timely

13
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:47,160
fashion, they can spuriously re-transmit, thus resulting in

14
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:51,420
many copies of the same packets being outstanding

15
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:53,780
in the network at any one time.

16
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:56,510
Another cause of congestion collapse is simply undelivered

17
00:00:56,510 --> 00:01:00,530
packets, where packets consume resources and are dropped

18
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:03,695
elsewhere in the network. The solution to spurious

19
00:01:03,695 --> 00:01:07,010
re-transmissions is to have better timers and to

20
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:09,450
use TCP congestion control, which we'll talk about

21
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:12,650
next. The solution to undelivered packets is to

22
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:16,490
apply congestion control to all traffic. Congestion control

23
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:18,690
is the topic of the rest of this lesson.
