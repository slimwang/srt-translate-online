00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:04,142
Alright so this is fairly straightforward. And you might remember it actually

2
00:00:04,142 --> 00:00:07,854
from unit two where we had to deal with intersecting rects with the view rects

3
00:00:07,854 --> 00:00:12,810
and the canvas styles. So to do this we simply take each rectangle and compare

4
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:17,264
the left most and right most edges of both. And see if they overlap and do the

5
00:00:17,264 --> 00:00:21,413
same with the top and the bottom of each rectangle. After that, we return a

6
00:00:21,413 --> 00:00:23,350
Boolean based on it and we're done.
