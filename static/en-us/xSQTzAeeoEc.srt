Let me give another example and ask you a quiz.

2
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:06,540
Suppose we have data just like this over here.

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:09,740
Do you think there could be a local minimum if you

4
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:12,750
initialize this data set with two cluster centers?

5
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:17,437
Is there a stable solution where which the two cluster would not end up

6
00:00:17,437 --> 00:00:19,660
one over here and one over here?

7
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:24,650
Or put differently, is there, does there exist a bad local minimum?

8
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:25,150
Yes or no?
