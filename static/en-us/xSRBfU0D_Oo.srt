00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:03,950
So you might have gotten any number
of answers to this question.

2
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:06,410
In fact, if you run it twice
on two different computers or

3
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:09,190
two different times,
you might get different addresses.

4
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:12,430
Here, it is trying it twice and happened
to get the same address twice in a row.

5
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:15,210
But about the address you see
is not the same one as this.

6
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:19,145
It turns out that there isn't actually a
single host of the single address behind

7
00:00:19,145 --> 00:00:19,950
google.com.

8
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:22,350
They actually have more
than one computer there.

9
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:23,210
Surprise, surprise.

10
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:24,510
Mild understatement.

11
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:27,090
When your browser goes
to look up google.com,

12
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:29,330
it can get a bunch of
different addresses.

13
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:33,020
Which helps Google balance load amongst
all their different data centers.

14
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:36,120
But how do we get from a host
name to an IP address, anyway?

15
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,050
Let's look at that next.
