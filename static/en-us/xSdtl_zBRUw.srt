00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,876
Here are the factored pairs for negative 45 and we want to find one that sums to

2
00:00:04,876 --> 00:00:09,579
four. Well, negative 5 and 9 multiply to negative 45 and add to 4, so these are

3
00:00:09,579 --> 00:00:14,310
my answers for the first number puzzle. For the second number puzzle, I want to

4
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:19,052
find 2 numbers that multiply to negative 45 and add to negative 12. That must be

5
00:00:19,052 --> 00:00:23,615
3 and negative 15. For the third number puzzle, I want to find factors of 45

6
00:00:23,615 --> 00:00:28,652
that sum to negative 14. Well, here are the positive factor pairs for positive

7
00:00:28,652 --> 00:00:32,891
45, but none of these pairs add to negative 14. This must mean I need the

8
00:00:32,891 --> 00:00:37,576
negative factor pairs of positive 45. We know a negative times a negative is a

9
00:00:37,576 --> 00:00:42,383
positive. So now, I'm just looking for the factor pair that adds to negative 14.

10
00:00:42,383 --> 00:00:47,996
This would be negative 5 and negative 9. This must mean the last factor pair is

11
00:00:47,996 --> 00:00:53,568
negative 1 and negative 45. They sum to negative 46 and they multiply to

12
00:00:53,568 --> 00:00:54,608
positive 45.
