1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,580
And now let me show you the thing that I just blew right past you

2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:06,040
that's even cooler about RANSAC.

3
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:08,119
All right? So how big does N have to be?

4
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:10,350
Well, we gave you this equation, right?

5
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:13,692
N is greater than 1 minus, log of 1 minus p over log.

6
00:00:13,692 --> 00:00:15,000
[NOISE] Fine.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,950
Look at that function.

8
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:17,540
What's p?

9
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:19,630
P is the probability of success.

10
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:20,290
What's e?

11
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:21,680
The percentage of outliers.

12
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:22,840
What's S?

13
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:25,300
The number of points in your minimal set.

14
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:30,570
Notice, what's not in there is the number of points in the image, or

15
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:33,640
the number of features.

16
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:36,294
So, you may have 10,000 or 1,000 or 100 or

17
00:00:36,294 --> 00:00:39,020
500 punitive matches, let's say, for a transform.

18
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:42,060
Remember all those red lines that were going back and forth.

19
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:45,830
The number of samples you have to draw has nothing to

20
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:49,790
do with the number of possible matches that you're looking at.

21
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:54,040
It only has to do with the percentage of wrong ones.

22
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,630
And, then the you know,

23
00:00:55,630 --> 00:01:00,400
the size, the minimal set and how sure you want to be that you got there.

24
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:04,319
So that's really great because that means that the whole algorithm is pretty

25
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:07,600
scale invariant with respect, or I should say size invariant with respect to

26
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,260
the number matches, the number of, of hypothesized points that you have.

27
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:15,902
And that actually is, is part of the reason that it, it, it works so well.

28
00:01:15,902 --> 00:01:19,170
All right, so let's illustrate that here.

29
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:21,640
Let's suppose that I got two pictures, and let's just for

30
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:24,410
the sake here assume that there's just a translation.

31
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:27,060
So I'm just looking for one point match to one point.

32
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:29,790
And the system has proposed a whole bunch of matches.

33
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:31,310
So there's one, and there's another one, and

34
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:32,660
there's another, and there's another.

35
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:36,330
And all of these you and I know are actually correct, right Meghan?

36
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:37,390
Right. Okay.

37
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:41,530
But it also propose this one and propose that one and those are not right.

38
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:45,030
But of course only you and I know that and 9 million people watching.

39
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,640
Okay, but the computer is not so smart.

40
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,910
It doesn't know that.

41
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:51,330
So showing you how RANSAC works.

42
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:53,050
What we do is we select one match.

43
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:53,640
Here's one.

44
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,950
That blue one right there.

45
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:58,150
And we just count the number of matches that agree.

46
00:01:58,150 --> 00:01:59,860
So one, two, three, four, five.

47
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:00,880
Okay, great.

48
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,890
And then we take a look at the ones that don't agree.

49
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:04,690
Two. So five out of seven.

50
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:05,430
That's 5 times 70%.

51
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:06,660
Or whatever.

52
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:08,430
Five out of seven of them agree.

53
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:09,758
Great.

54
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:11,800
Okay, so we gotta do it again.

55
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,330
We pick another one.

56
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:16,550
We try that one, count the ones that agree, one, two.

57
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:20,270
Count the ones that don't agree, one, two, three, four, five.

58
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:22,000
That's two out of seven, last time I checked,

59
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,950
two out of seven is way lower than five out of seven.

60
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:27,920
So you would basically say, a-ha.

61
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,048
Here is the set of matches that are right.

62
00:02:31,048 --> 00:02:37,040
Now I've got five points matches for doing a translation.

63
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,750
How many points does it take to do a translation?

64
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,040
It only took one.

65
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,820
So, should I just pick one?

66
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:43,880
No.

67
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:47,970
I have five translations here, all of which are a little noisy.

68
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:49,240
So what do I do?

69
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,770
I just take the average.

70
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:52,430
I could even do sort of a robust average, but

71
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:54,610
you probably don't even have to at this point, right?

72
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:57,300
You just have to make sure you have enough points left in order to

73
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,050
take the average.

74
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:02,250
So basically, what you're doing is you're going to use ransack in order to

75
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:08,150
select the points that you believe actually come from the Gaussian noise model.

76
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:09,550
Get rid of the outliers.

77
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:10,800
And then you do an average,

78
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,970
which is the right thing to do when you have points from a Gaussian noise model.
