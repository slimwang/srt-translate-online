00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Let's say we're in the middle of parsing--I've written

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
new grammar for us, here on the left.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
This one has a new nonterminal F--

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
just to make things interesting.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
That is how we roll here, in programming languages.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
So here's our grammar; it has 4 rewrite rules.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
The input is: (int - int)

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
but we've only seen 2 of those tokens so far:

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
the (int) and the (minus).

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
One of the elements of chart[2] is:

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
(E --> E -), and Here We Are,

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
and we're looking for an (E) in the future--

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
and we started this in chart state[0].

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I have written out, down here at the bottom,

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
five possible parse states.

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Why don't you tell me which of these parse states

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
are going to be brought in by chart state[2],

18
00:00:43,000 --> 99:59:59,999
by computing the closure?
