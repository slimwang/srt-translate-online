00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:04,110
In this lesson, we talked about
several technologies that are relevant

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:05,860
to the data center space.

3
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:10,830
We described the commonly used
multi-tier software architecture models,

4
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:14,190
and discussed the management
tradeoffs that exists among them.

5
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:16,583
We talked about cloud computing and

6
00:00:16,583 --> 00:00:21,208
the role that it plays in addressing
some of the scale and cost related

7
00:00:21,208 --> 00:00:26,410
challenges to supporting really
large-scale applications and services.

8
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:30,765
And we also briefly mention some of the
popular technologies that form the cloud

9
00:00:30,765 --> 00:00:32,397
computing landscape today.
