1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:02,210
So here you can see I pasted my code in.

2
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:05,450
First of all, on my class,
I've created a few member variables.

3
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:09,980
I have a Google API Client, called
nGoogleApiClient, I have a text view

4
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:14,230
called nStatusText, and I have two
buttons called requestUpdatesButton and

5
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:16,170
removeUpdatesButton.

6
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:20,670
Then in uncreated self, I set up these
variables, so request updates button,

7
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:23,880
I use find view by ID to get
the request activity updates button.

8
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:27,780
And if you go back to the layout file
you'll see that's what we called it.

9
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:29,520
Ditto for remove updates button,

10
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:33,720
I use find view by id to get
the remove activity updates button.

11
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:36,390
And then finally for text,
I cast to a TextView,

12
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:39,770
and I use findViewByID
the detectedActivities.

13
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:42,470
So these are my three controls,
the requesting updates,

14
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:43,680
the removing updates, and

15
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,540
the status text that you may recall
from the demo we showed earlier on.

16
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:50,420
And then finally in OnCreate, I just
called this helper function called

17
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:54,550
buildGoogleApiClient and build a Google
API client is the standard thing

18
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:58,720
that you've seen all along, where I
create a new GoogleApiClient.Builder and

19
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,890
I pass it the various parameters.

20
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:03,260
Adding the on connection
callbacks to this,

21
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:06,890
adding OnConnectionFailedListener
to this, adding the API to be

22
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:10,130
the ActivityRecognition.API
because that's what we're doing.

23
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:13,058
And then building it, and
setting that to be my nGoogleApiClient.

24
00:01:13,058 --> 00:01:17,420
So now that' we've done this, the next
thing that we want to do is that we want

25
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:22,180
to remember on our intent service we
were broadcasting the activities back

26
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:24,310
and we want this class to receive them.

27
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:26,400
So we have to implement
the receiver details on it.
