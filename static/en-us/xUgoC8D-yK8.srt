00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:04,250
This is the simplified fraction, fantastic work if you found it. I think it's

2
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:09,070
best to start by reducing the factors of x plus one and x plus five. These

3
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:13,330
factors in the numerator and denominator cancel or reduce to one. I don't want

4
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:16,630
to forget about these monomial terms, but everything looks a little confusing

5
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:20,353
right now. So I'm going to rewrite my line. So we have two x-squared, times x

6
00:00:20,353 --> 00:00:26,008
plus three, times two x minus five, for our numerator. For the denominator we

7
00:00:26,008 --> 00:00:31,462
have x minus 3 times 6x times 2x plus 1. Notice that I switched the order of

8
00:00:31,462 --> 00:00:35,824
this 6x and this x minus 3. We can do that since we're multiplying here. We know

9
00:00:35,824 --> 00:00:41,130
the multiplication is commutative. We know 2/6 reduces to 1/3 so I can simplify

10
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:45,654
this fraction. We can also simplify our powers of x we have x squared in the

11
00:00:45,654 --> 00:00:50,253
numerator and 1 x in the denominator so we'll be left with 1 x in our numerator

12
00:00:50,253 --> 00:00:55,128
in our final answer. I'll show it more easily by writing x squared as x times x.

13
00:00:55,128 --> 00:01:01,050
We simplify each of these x's since they really equal 1, and 2 divided by 2

14
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:05,663
equals 1, and 2 into 6 equals 3. This gives us our final answer.
