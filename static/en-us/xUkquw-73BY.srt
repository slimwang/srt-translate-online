1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,989
Well, now I'm being tricky because 240 is in here and that's not going to be an

2
00:00:04,989 --> 00:00:10,414
integer standard deviation away from the mean. It's like 1.5 standard deviations

3
00:00:10,414 --> 00:00:15,693
from the mean approximately. So then, how are we suppose to calculate the area

4
00:00:15,693 --> 00:00:21,420
under this curve between negative infinity and this non-integer number standard

5
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:27,597
deviation Deviations from the mean. Well, we can guess that it'll be between

6
00:00:27,597 --> 00:00:34,041
approximately 84 percent and 97.5 percent. 'Because we know that this is 68

7
00:00:34,041 --> 00:00:41,032
percent between here and here. 13.5 percent here, and 2.5 % here, so there'll be

8
00:00:41,032 --> 00:00:47,869
approximately 84 % of values between negative infinity and 226. Another way to

9
00:00:47,869 --> 00:00:54,232
look at it is since it's symmetrical, you know that 50% is less than the mean,

10
00:00:54,232 --> 00:01:00,602
and you know that 34 % is between the mean and one standard deviation. So 84 %

11
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:07,371
have less than 226 Facebook friends. If we add this section which is 13.5 % then

12
00:01:07,371 --> 00:01:14,082
we know that 97.5 % Are between negative infinity and 262. So, lets' call the

13
00:01:14,082 --> 00:01:20,896
proportion p. We know that p has to be greater than 0.84, and less than 0.975.

14
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:27,368
But we're going to use a tool that will help us figure out, for any value, what

15
00:01:27,368 --> 00:01:29,665
proportion will this be.
