1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,710
Derrick what do you think about this?

2
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:04,190
>> So what we talked about before was

3
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:06,700
that the bottom layer
is the hardware layer.

4
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:09,340
I'm not completely sure what
the hardware of Watson looks like but

5
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,610
I assume there has to be a physical
computer there somewhere.

6
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:17,455
At the next layer, the algorithm layer,
Watson has some general searching and

7
00:00:17,455 --> 00:00:21,830
decision-making ability that allows him
to search over his knowledge base and

8
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:22,950
come to decisions.

9
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:25,750
These are general abilities that
are separated from whatever

10
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:27,880
individual thing he's trying
to think about right now.

11
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:31,390
And then at the top layer we
can think about exactly that,

12
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:32,900
what he's trying to
think about right now.

13
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:36,510
So the task here might be
answering the inputted clue.

14
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:40,010
This would involve searching on
the individual information in the clue,

15
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:42,830
processing his knowledge
specifically about that data,

16
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:46,300
and then coming to an answer
specifically for that clue.

17
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:47,489
>> That was a good answer David.

18
00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:54,450
So the again the three layers and
note that in the task layer here,

19
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:58,670
answering the inputted clue,
knowledge is also a part of it.

20
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:01,720
Knowledge that Watson must
have in order to be able to

21
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:05,379
answer that particular question,
how that knowledge is implemented,

22
00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:08,280
what kind of presentations it
uses goes in the second layer.
