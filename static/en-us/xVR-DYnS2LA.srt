00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:04,400
So I've recorded my timeline
trace with the paint profiler on.

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:05,990
I've clicked on one of these boxes, and

3
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:09,890
I can immediately see that there
is one section besides document.

4
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:11,790
I'll click on tote's promoted.

5
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:14,960
Thank you again for
that great name Paul.

6
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,060
And I can see that this
layer was composited,

7
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:20,250
because it overlaps with
other composited content.

8
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:24,540
In this case the other content is
the color block section behind it.

9
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:27,640
Looking in the layers panel, you can
see that underneath the root document

10
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:30,030
there are two layers on the page.

11
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:33,240
Looking at the source for the page you
can see that the color block element

12
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:36,450
has a translateZ
transform applied to it.

13
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:38,630
This means it's promoted
to its own layer.

14
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:42,620
In order to maintain the draw order,
the section in the text with it,

15
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:44,140
this box right here.

16
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:48,560
Must also now have its own layer and
be placed on top of the color block.

17
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:52,780
If you promote an element to a layer,
you need to be careful because you could

18
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:56,650
accidentally create a lot of other
layers with it due to overlap.

19
00:00:56,650 --> 00:00:58,330
So anyways, there you have it.

20
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:01,290
The paint profiler gives you an awesome
way to keep track of the layers that

21
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:02,280
you're creating.

22
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,410
The main thing is to try to balance
the compositing time in layer management

23
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:09,090
with time that you spend in
other parts of the pipeline.

24
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:11,440
Applying will-change: transform or

25
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:15,970
translate z0 to all of your
elements might seem appealing, but

26
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:19,730
it's going to send your memory usage and
compositing time through the roof.

27
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:23,050
In the end, you might cause
more problems than you solve.

28
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:24,750
Which is especially a problem on mobile.
