1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:03,455
Part of the work I've done with couples revolves around kind of the sexual

2
00:00:03,455 --> 00:00:08,550
scripts, which are the sexual response cycles that I see couples come in with.

3
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:11,865
And it's almost like they have this preconditioned idea that this is the story

4
00:00:11,865 --> 00:00:14,823
I'm supposed to have for sex and if it doesn't go this way, then there's

5
00:00:14,823 --> 00:00:19,267
something wrong. And so, I have to talk with him about, you know what, that's

6
00:00:19,267 --> 00:00:21,951
just the story that we have in the United States, mainly from this medical

7
00:00:21,951 --> 00:00:28,405
point of view. But, you can write your sexual script any way you want. So, it

8
00:00:28,405 --> 00:00:32,960
doesn't have to end in orgasm. It doesn't have to start out with this massive

9
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,744
building up of desire and excitement. it can go any way that you want it to and

10
00:00:37,744 --> 00:00:41,059
that's what's really important as people need to understand that they really

11
00:00:41,059 --> 00:00:46,330
own their sexual response cycle. And they own their sexual script. And it

12
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:48,976
really can be written and rewritten any way that's, that's comfortable for

13
00:00:48,976 --> 00:00:52,880
them. So we know that there's a difference in sexual response depending on the

14
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:57,980
culture but do women and men have different orgasms. Even though a lot of

15
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:02,880
people orgasms whether it be through self stimulation self love or partnered or

16
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:08,724
partnered experiences, many people do orgasms. However, there are large

17
00:01:08,724 --> 00:01:12,760
percentages of people who do not. again a lot of times that does tend to be

18
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:19,282
women who experience more difficulty orgaziming. On average, the orgasm, kind

19
00:01:19,282 --> 00:01:24,542
of experience is the shortest part of a sexual response cycle. Unless of

20
00:01:24,542 --> 00:01:28,050
course, you're, you know, a pig in which case, it's like thirty minutes long.

21
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:31,560
But, humans are very short cycled for their orgasm but that really varies from

22
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:36,171
person to person as well. So, for some people an orgasm might last like thirty

23
00:01:36,171 --> 00:01:41,706
seconds, for other people it could last a matter of minutes. and actually woman

24
00:01:41,706 --> 00:01:47,770
tend to have longer orgasms than men. or are capable of longer orgasms. Women,

25
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:51,790
when they do orgasm are also able to have multiple orgasms pretty consecutively

26
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:56,920
in a row pretty easily compared to their male counterpart. So, once a woman

27
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:00,700
kind of figures out how to have an orgasm, she actually has more opportunity

28
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:06,428
for longer orgasms and more of them in comparison to men. However in general,

29
00:02:06,428 --> 00:02:10,991
more women do struggle to kind of learn how to orgasm. And I say learn how to

30
00:02:10,991 --> 00:02:14,489
orgasm because one of the biggest differences is just is an, it's an anatomical

31
00:02:14,489 --> 00:02:19,273
difference, right. So men they have basically all of their equipment right in

32
00:02:19,273 --> 00:02:22,771
front of them on the outside, you know, their penis is right in front of them,

33
00:02:22,771 --> 00:02:28,210
their testicles is right in front of them. So it's, it's very easy to kind of

34
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:32,868
self explore and figure it out what to do, right. With women, most of the

35
00:02:32,868 --> 00:02:37,545
equipment is internal. so it's very difficult to kind of figure out what, what

36
00:02:37,545 --> 00:02:42,723
your body's doing, what something feels like. I mean and there's a difference

37
00:02:42,723 --> 00:02:44,373
between a clitoral orgasm and a

38
00:02:44,373 --> 00:02:45,054
[INAUDIBLE]

39
00:02:45,054 --> 00:02:49,539
spot orgasm or a G-spot orgasm. And a lot of women, it takes a lot of

40
00:02:49,539 --> 00:02:55,450
exploration before they're really able to have an orgasm in either location.

41
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:59,230
And a lot of the holdup for women is just that many societies, pretty much

42
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:04,785
across the globe, many societies have put restrictions on women. social

43
00:03:04,785 --> 00:03:08,745
restrictions, moral restrictions, religious restrictions where they're, they're

44
00:03:08,745 --> 00:03:12,210
kind of sent this message that sex is something that they're not supposed to

45
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:17,167
enjoy. And doesn't really, their needs really aren't all that important in

46
00:03:17,167 --> 00:03:22,021
terms of desire, arousal and orgasm. And so, it's very challenging to, for

47
00:03:22,021 --> 00:03:26,494
women not only because it's anatomical differences to orgasm because we have to

48
00:03:26,494 --> 00:03:32,777
learn. But they also have to tear down kind of this societal block or wall that

49
00:03:32,777 --> 00:03:38,969
has been created in their mind around not being able to orgasm. So, couple

50
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:42,131
things I recommend for people when I see clients, especially women who are

51
00:03:42,131 --> 00:03:46,430
struggling to have an orgasm and they want to have an orgasm. It's okay if

52
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:50,490
people don't want to orgasm too. That's fine. but what I recommend when they do

53
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:55,272
is, a lot of self exploration, so getting to know their own body. And then a

54
00:03:55,272 --> 00:03:59,688
lot of, just cognitive behavioral therapies to work on the fact that it's

55
00:03:59,688 --> 00:04:04,242
totally normative and natural to have sexual feelings and to feel good when

56
00:04:04,242 --> 00:04:09,320
you're engaging in certain behaviors.
