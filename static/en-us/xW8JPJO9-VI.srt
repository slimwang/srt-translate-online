00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:04,682
Congratulations, you just engaged in mental rotation. This is the process of

2
00:00:04,682 --> 00:00:10,376
imagining an object rotating in three-dimensional space. As it turns out,

3
00:00:10,376 --> 00:00:14,660
there's actually some gender differences in performing mental rotation tasks.

4
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:21,000
It appears that boys and man, perform better in these tasks. This appears to be

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,662
universal, because they found similar findings in China, Japan, Ecuador,

6
00:00:25,662 --> 00:00:31,240
Ireland and in the US. So how do we organize information in our environment?

7
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:35,539
Well we do so by labeling and naming things. We first do this in the most basic

8
00:00:35,539 --> 00:00:41,330
unit of knowledge, which is called a concept. The concept is a mental group of

9
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:46,291
events, objects, or people. So, for example, the concept of an animal can

10
00:00:46,291 --> 00:00:51,272
include mental groups for birds and fish. And these can be broken down even

11
00:00:51,272 --> 00:00:56,080
further into different types of birds. For example, an eagle or sparrow. In

12
00:00:56,080 --> 00:01:00,080
different types of fish for example a catfish or a koi fish. These concepts

13
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:05,402
help us in our attempt to organize and perceive the world. To that end we often

14
00:01:05,402 --> 00:01:09,355
engage in what's called a concept hierarchy, as you see here which is an

15
00:01:09,355 --> 00:01:15,442
arrangement of concepts in a particular way. Some being really general, and

16
00:01:15,442 --> 00:01:19,207
some being more specific. And there's two last definitions we need to address

17
00:01:19,207 --> 00:01:25,045
here. The first is category. A category is when multiple concepts are organized

18
00:01:25,045 --> 00:01:30,567
around one concept that they all have in common. For example, vehicles or

19
00:01:30,567 --> 00:01:34,464
trees. We can have all the different types of vehicles or all the different

20
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:39,216
types of trees organized around this category. And these are well defined, but

21
00:01:39,216 --> 00:01:44,949
other categories can be kind of fuzzy. Such as good or consciousness. It can be

22
00:01:44,949 --> 00:01:50,760
difficult to order other concepts around one of these 2 concepts. And finally

23
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:54,830
we have a prototype, which is the best fitting example of a category.
