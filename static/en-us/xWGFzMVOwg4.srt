00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,780
Suppose you're given
this 2-D Mesh network.

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:07,930
It has a diameter that's approximately
2 times the square root of P.

3
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:09,220
Here's my question.

4
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:12,760
Where do you need to add links
to reduce the diameter by half?

5
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:15,325
Let's label every node by its
coordinates, starting at (0,

6
00:00:15,325 --> 00:00:19,470
0) in the upper left hand corner and
going to (root P- 1,

7
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:21,880
root P- 1) in the lower right.

8
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:23,550
Here are your choices.

9
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:26,470
Is the answer to connect
the opposite corners?

10
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:31,870
Or is the answer to add a ring of
links that connect the corners?

11
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:35,780
Or is the answer to add wraparound
links from left to right and

12
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:37,580
from top to bottom?

13
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:40,190
Check all the ones you
think are correct.

14
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:42,706
If you think none of them will
cut the diameter in half,

15
00:00:42,706 --> 00:00:44,630
then submit without checking anything.
