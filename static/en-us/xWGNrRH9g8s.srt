00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,646
Now that you understand the components of the diffuse reflection model give

2
00:00:02,646 --> 00:00:06,275
them a try. In the demo that follows we'll use the terms KA, and KD in the

3
00:00:06,275 --> 00:00:10,259
reflection equation. These are simply numbers used to scale the effect of the

4
00:00:10,259 --> 00:00:14,310
ambient and diffuse contributions up and down. KA is the greyscale level of the

5
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:18,979
ambient light and KD is handy way to modify the diffuse contribution. To sum up

6
00:00:18,979 --> 00:00:23,334
the equation we use for this demo it's fragment color equals KA times material

7
00:00:23,334 --> 00:00:28,634
plus KD times material times N.L. This is actually a bit simplified from what

8
00:00:28,634 --> 00:00:32,476
3JS allows. In 3JS, you can inset an entirely different ambient color, though

9
00:00:32,476 --> 00:00:36,610
to be honest, this is a peculiar thing to do. Also, in this demo, you'll a see

10
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:39,201
different color space used. Instead of RGB, it's hue, saturation and lightness.

11
00:00:39,201 --> 00:00:40,243
HSL for short. Hue means the color essentially. Saturation is how much the hue

12
00:00:40,243 --> 00:00:47,114
is used. Lightness is a scale factor, letting you easily make the color itself

13
00:00:47,114 --> 00:00:53,880
brighter or darker. Here's a visualization of the color space. The 3JS library

14
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:58,740
lets you use HSL to set colors. For example, this code gives a mustard color.

15
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:03,157
So go try out the demo. Vary the ambiant and diffuse contributions. Change the

16
00:01:03,157 --> 00:01:06,536
material color. Move the view around and see the effect. It's worth your while

17
00:01:06,536 --> 00:01:08,830
to catch your breath and play around a bit so that you truly understand this

18
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:10,200
reflection model.
