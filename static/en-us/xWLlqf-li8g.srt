1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:03,130
We start out by multiplying the top and

2
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:07,160
the bottom of our fraction by the conjugate of our initial denominator.

3
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:11,870
So that means we're multiplying by negative three minus the square root of five,

4
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:16,020
over negative three minus the square root of five. We can't really simplify

5
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:20,420
the numerator. It's just going to stay as negative three times the square root

6
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:24,791
of two minus the square root of ten. The denominator does simplify however,

7
00:00:24,791 --> 00:00:28,370
since we know that the square root of five squared is just five.

8
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:33,220
And nine minus five is just four. So this is our final answer, negative three

9
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:38,769
times the square root of two minus the square root of ten all divided by four.
