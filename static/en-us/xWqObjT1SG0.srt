00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,850
Light emitters can take whatever form you like since, ultimately, the effect of

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:06,445
a light is something computed in the vertex or fragment shading. That said,

3
00:00:06,445 --> 00:00:09,850
there are a few different common forms of lights used in applications. The

4
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:13,130
simplest is called a directional light. This type of light is defined by just

5
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:17,252
that, a direction vector. A directional light is something like the sun. The

6
00:00:17,252 --> 00:00:20,024
direction to the sun is essentially the same for every object on earth, and a

7
00:00:20,024 --> 00:00:24,222
directional light is considered infinitely far away. In many modelers, such as

8
00:00:24,222 --> 00:00:27,498
the 3JS editor here, the directional light will be shown as some local point

9
00:00:27,498 --> 00:00:31,858
that you can move around. However, you're truly manipulating the direction, not

10
00:00:31,858 --> 00:00:35,114
the location of the light. Since we often combine colors in various ways,

11
00:00:35,114 --> 00:00:39,080
there's not necessarily an upper limit of 1.0 to a color channel. It all

12
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:41,945
depends. For example, if I want a clear the screen, I would want to use values

13
00:00:41,945 --> 00:00:46,088
from zero to one. There's an upper limit of each channel's intensity, so values

14
00:00:46,088 --> 00:00:50,212
larger than 1.0 are beyond the monitor's abilities. However, if I wanted to

15
00:00:50,212 --> 00:00:53,949
make the light bright, I might set its intensity to 11. When the distance from

16
00:00:53,949 --> 00:00:56,450
the light to the object and the object's color are taken into account, the

17
00:00:56,450 --> 00:01:00,890
final color may well be within the zero to one range. In some systems, you can

18
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:03,794
even set the light intensity to a negative number, meaning the light is somehow

19
00:01:03,794 --> 00:01:07,650
sucking photons from the surface. The light's color is just a number in an

20
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:11,138
equation after all. This is true for a material's color too, that it could be

21
00:01:11,138 --> 00:01:14,114
set however you want, but we tend to leave material colors between zero and

22
00:01:14,114 --> 00:01:18,782
one, thinking of them as reflectivities. These basic illumination equations are

23
00:01:18,782 --> 00:01:21,491
not based on any physical unit, such as watts or lumens, but rather are set in

24
00:01:21,491 --> 00:01:24,310
the zero to one range for our convenience.
