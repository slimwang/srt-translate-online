00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,390
Before going into how single tape
machines can simulate multi-tape ones,

2
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:07,760
I want to warm up with a very simple
example to illustrate what we mean

3
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:10,860
when I say that one machine
can simulate another.

4
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:13,420
So let's consider what I'll
call stay-put machines.

5
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:17,690
These have the capability of not moving
their heads in a computation step.

6
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:21,380
Which turing machines as we defined
them are not allowed to do.

7
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:24,610
So the transition function
now includes a S for

8
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:27,750
the direction,
which makes the head stay put.

9
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:31,280
Now this doesn't add any computational
capability to the machine.

10
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:34,810
Because I can accomplish the same
things with a normal turing machine.

11
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:39,400
For every transition where the head
stays put, we can introduce a new state.

12
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:42,220
And just have the head move
one step to the right.

13
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:44,240
And then one step back to the left.

14
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:47,610
Gamma here means to match
everything in the tape alphabet.

15
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:50,600
And this puts the had back
in the spot it started in,

16
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,740
without affecting the tape's contents.

17
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:55,990
Except for occasionally taking
an extra movement step.

18
00:00:55,990 --> 00:01:00,350
This turning machine will operate in
the same way as the stay put machine.

19
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:04,200
More precisely, we say that two machines
are equivalent if they accept the same

20
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:08,990
inputs, reject the same inputs and
loop on the same inputs.

21
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:12,790
If we consider the tape to be part of
the output equivalent machines also

22
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:15,570
need to halt with
the same tape contents.

23
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:17,750
Note that other properties
of the machine such as,

24
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:20,240
the number of states,
the tape alphabet, or

25
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:24,560
the number of steps in any given
computation do not need to be the same.

26
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,780
Just the relationship between the input
and the output needs to be the same.
