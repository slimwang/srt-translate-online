1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The mean is obviously 25.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
In fact, every element over here is 5 times as large as any element over here.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Now, how does this affect the variance?

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Well, when we compute the differences from the mean, they're going to be 5 times as large.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
When we square them, they will be 25 times as large.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
As a result, the variance is 25 times as large as over here--it's 50.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
And we can quickly check this.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Obviously, there is no difference for 25 in the middle.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
20 and 25 are 5 apart--the square of this is 25.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Same for 30. 15 and 25 are 10 apart. The square is 100.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
We add those up--we get 250--and now we divide by 5 to get back our 50.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The standard deviation is 7.071,

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
and that's exactly 5 times as large as the standard deviation over here.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
If this is 25 times as large as this one,

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
then the square root of it will be just 5 times as large as this one.

16
00:00:55,000 --> 99:59:59,999
You can easily verify that this is the square root of 50.
