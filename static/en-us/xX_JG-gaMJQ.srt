1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,060
Whoa.
We made a prototype.

2
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:03,880
It gave us information we needed.

3
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:04,980
Well done prototype.

4
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:06,410
You rock.

5
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:09,430
Unfortunately, as we said at
the beginning of this lesson,

6
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:12,720
prototypes should exist for
exactly as long as they are needed, and

7
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:13,685
we don't need you anymore.

8
00:00:13,685 --> 00:00:19,886
[SOUND] And, we're done.

9
00:00:19,886 --> 00:00:22,889
Now that we've gotten feedback on
the overall structure of the app,

10
00:00:22,889 --> 00:00:24,028
we'll go into Envision,

11
00:00:24,028 --> 00:00:27,410
getting a deeper input from Jonathon
on how to make interactive prototypes.
