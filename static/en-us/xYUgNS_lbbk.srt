1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:02,985
However, there could be some potential negative effects with people using

2
00:00:02,985 --> 00:00:07,290
psilocybin. Could you touch on perhaps some unusual experiences?

3
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:11,506
>> Yeah, so it's very important to understand that there are risks, very real

4
00:00:11,506 --> 00:00:17,258
risks, associated with exposure to psilocybin. So in our studies at Johns

5
00:00:17,258 --> 00:00:22,250
Hopkins in, in a therapeutic context and when we are doing studies in healthy

6
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:29,830
volunteers. We very carefully screen our volunteers. We develop rapport with

7
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:35,760
them. The drug is given under very tightly-supervised and supportive context,

8
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:42,584
and we do after-care with them. why do we this? So, the reason that we do this

9
00:00:42,584 --> 00:00:48,948
is because unfortunately psilocybin can produce some, some very difficult long

10
00:00:48,948 --> 00:00:56,362
lasting, and potentially harmful effects. So, number one is that, under the

11
00:00:56,362 --> 00:01:01,606
influence of psilocybin, people can have panic or fear reactions, and they can

12
00:01:01,606 --> 00:01:09,298
end up engaging in dangerous behavior, and it's uncommon. But it's not unheard

13
00:01:09,298 --> 00:01:14,034
of to read reports where people run out into traffic, jump out of windows, you

14
00:01:14,034 --> 00:01:22,745
know, flee in ways that get themselves or other people into trouble. Two is

15
00:01:22,745 --> 00:01:27,033
that there's, there really is concern, and this is more serious than just the

16
00:01:27,033 --> 00:01:33,472
panic, there really is concern that in some individual. Exposure to psilocybin

17
00:01:33,472 --> 00:01:35,266
and other compounds of this

18
00:01:35,266 --> 00:01:36,124
[INAUDIBLE]

19
00:01:36,124 --> 00:01:44,510
hallucinating class can precipitate in during psychiatric illness. the, the

20
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:48,794
worst possible case would be precipitation of psychosis or schizophrenia of

21
00:01:48,794 --> 00:01:55,580
someone who was already vulnerable to that disorder. And that, it, that's a, a

22
00:01:55,580 --> 00:02:03,674
lifelong, irreversible disorder that is is disastrous for someone. Other than

23
00:02:03,674 --> 00:02:09,298
that there are some people who report persisting PTSD-like syndrome depression

24
00:02:09,298 --> 00:02:15,703
and anxiety disorders. So, we're very concerned about that and, and it's one of

25
00:02:15,703 --> 00:02:20,554
the reasons we screen people very carefully and support them through these

26
00:02:20,554 --> 00:02:27,393
kinds of experiences. We just recently have conducted, and are continuing to

27
00:02:27,393 --> 00:02:31,413
collect data on an online survey asking people about the most difficult

28
00:02:31,413 --> 00:02:37,758
experiences they've had with psilocybin. And what we're finding is that most

29
00:02:37,758 --> 00:02:42,113
people are reporting experiences when it's isolated to their most difficult

30
00:02:42,113 --> 00:02:46,535
experience, they're reporting experiences that are among the most difficult

31
00:02:46,535 --> 00:02:53,408
that they've ever had in their lives. And very often, the single most

32
00:02:53,408 --> 00:02:58,342
challenging experience, so there's nothing easy about these experiences. But

33
00:02:58,342 --> 00:03:05,398
the the more sobering statistics out of this survey is that anywhere from about

34
00:03:05,398 --> 00:03:11,964
3% to 10% of people are reporting persisting effects that look like some kind

35
00:03:11,964 --> 00:03:22,038
of persisting psychological harmful consequence. So some of these people never

36
00:03:22,038 --> 00:03:27,606
had been in therapy before and have sought out psychological counseling for

37
00:03:27,606 --> 00:03:33,174
fearful reaction, or anxiety disorders, or paranoid after the session with

38
00:03:33,174 --> 00:03:40,120
Silly Simon. And they attribute their seeking that out to the Silly Simon

39
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:47,276
session. about 6% of people report a decreased sense of well-being and, and so

40
00:03:47,276 --> 00:03:52,996
while these compounds may have great therapeutic potentials, there are also

41
00:03:52,996 --> 00:03:57,062
significant risks.

42
00:03:57,062 --> 00:03:58,196
>> Right, right.
