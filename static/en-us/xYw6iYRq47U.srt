1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,830
Okay, so before I start talking about
these variable declarations, the first

2
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:06,870
thing I want to point out is that none
of these are particularly good name for

3
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:07,440
a variable.

4
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:11,660
And none of them are particularly good
names, because it's easy to confuse

5
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:16,260
names like number, int, and integer
with the data type that comes before.

6
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,310
That said, two of these
declarations won't even work.

7
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:21,190
Let's look at the first one.

8
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:22,450
So, we have here the word integer,

9
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:24,390
which is in the position where
the variable type should be.

10
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:28,420
Now, in this lesson we've taught you
about two types, string and int.

11
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:32,259
So the computer will recognize
int as an I N T lowercase.

12
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:34,340
But it's not going to
recognize the word integer.

13
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:38,360
Your types must be exactly spelled and
capitalized as we showed you them.

14
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:39,780
So this one is incorrect.

15
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:42,650
Okay, so looking at this next one
the word int is correct here,

16
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:44,070
since we just talked about that.

17
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:45,610
This is a valid data type, but

18
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:50,020
the problem here is that you can't name
a variable the same name as a data type.

19
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:52,850
There's certain special words in Java
that have a meaning for the computer,

20
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:55,410
beyond just what they say such as int.

21
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:57,230
These special words
are known as keywords, and

22
00:00:57,230 --> 00:00:58,790
in Android Studio they're colored blue.

23
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:02,570
Now you can't name your variables
the same as any of these keywords.

24
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:06,370
Okay, so this one also has an issue,
okay so this third one,

25
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:08,260
it looks like our data type
is declared correctly.

26
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:10,370
Now technically this would work,

27
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:13,630
you've gotta type here that the computer
will recognize, and you've got a name,

28
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:16,320
that is something that fits
all the variable rules.

29
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,160
That said,
the name integer is a pretty vague name.

30
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:22,170
And it could easily confuse someone
else if they're just reading your code.

31
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:26,570
So because it's technically not wrong,
I'm not going to mark it.

32
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:28,680
But you should consider
a better variable name,

33
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,170
such as numberForCalculation.

34
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:32,720
Which is a little bit more
specific as to what its use is.
