1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:04,014
In this case, there would only be one feature that really actually matters.

2
00:00:04,014 --> 00:00:07,250
So we have two that are available to us potentially,

3
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:11,150
because we have two features for each training point.

4
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:13,980
But you can see that the coefficient for the second one is set to zero,

5
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:17,410
which means that it's effectively not being used in the regression.

6
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:20,520
So using this result, I can tell that the second feature is one that I

7
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:24,600
can basically disregard, at least in this particular regression and

8
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,360
that all of the discriminating power is coming from the first feature.
