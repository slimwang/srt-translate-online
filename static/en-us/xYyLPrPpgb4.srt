00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:06,211
I'm here with Dr. Bill Dally, who is Chief Scientist and Senior Vice president of Research NVIDIA.

2
00:00:06,211 --> 00:00:07,080
Welcome, Bill.

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:08,680
Well, thanks John. It's a pleasure to be here.

4
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:13,750
I'm glad to have an opportunity to chat with you about important trends in computing.

5
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:16,921
Super, tell us about your job in NVIDIA. What do you do?

6
00:00:16,921 --> 00:00:18,671
I really have two jobs.

7
00:00:18,671 --> 00:00:23,810
As Chief Scientist, I get to sort of look into a lot of neat technologies that we're developing

8
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:29,181
and try to set technical directions in certain strategic areas work with key customers

9
00:00:29,181 --> 00:00:32,115
and partners on technology initiatives.

10
00:00:32,115 --> 00:00:37,190
And then as Senior Vice President of Research, I build and lead NVIDIA Research,

11
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:42,428
which is a world class research lab doing research in a lot of interesting areas from graphics to parallel computing

12
00:00:42,428 --> 00:00:47,065
to circuits and architecture programming systems relevant to the future of NVIDIA.
