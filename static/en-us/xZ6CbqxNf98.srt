00:00:00,338 --> 00:00:05,420
So, here is a map of a small portion of Long Island, New York. Imagine there is

2
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:09,070
an automated car that can navigate the streets of this neighborhood.

3
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:13,420
It comes from the factory with these six cases bootstrapped in it. A,

4
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:17,540
B, C, and so on. For the time being, assume that the car navigates it's way in

5
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:21,450
this neighborhood solely by the method of learning where the car in case is.

6
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:26,215
So all it can use is this cases that is knows about. Now, suppose that we

7
00:00:26,215 --> 00:00:30,850
have a new problem. The new problem is how to go from Q to this end destination

8
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:34,490
denoted by the arrow. What route is most similar to this new problem?
