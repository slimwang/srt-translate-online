1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,730
How do you find for
the outsourcing vendors.

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:05,220
That's one million dollar question.

3
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:08,620
It's so hard to find them.

4
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:12,290
It's even harder than hiring,
because basically,

5
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:16,570
you are interested in finding someone
that will do the job that you need to do

6
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:20,920
right now in a cheaper price but
hopefully in a better quality.

7
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:23,680
And this is hard.

8
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,670
And a lot of off showing
professional are still

9
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:31,190
struggling with finding
the perfect vendor.

10
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:36,410
Because you need the job to be perfect,
or at least like in very good standards.

11
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:42,050
You need them to be there for
you at all times, to be responsive.

12
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:45,380
You need them to be aware of costs.

13
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:47,440
You need them to be cost effective.

14
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:51,260
And you need them to really work with
you, and share the culture with you.

15
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:55,800
And finding this perfect fit for
the long term can be very challenging.

16
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:59,420
And the best ways to find an outsourcer

17
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:04,410
is [INAUDIBLE] to the best ways to
find a new employee or a new partner.

18
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:06,330
You're going to your friends,
to your colleagues,

19
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:08,560
to people you value their opinion.

20
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,890
And you're asking them,
who do you work with?

21
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:15,420
When did you have a good
experience with an outsourcer?

22
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:18,620
You're going to events and
you're trying to find professionals

23
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:21,779
that are the similar to you,
that are using outsourcing services.

24
00:01:23,355 --> 00:01:25,480
Or you're getting lucky basically.

25
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:29,000
You're working with Elance or oDesk and

26
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,490
you're trying to in you're
starting to test them.

27
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:37,210
You're doing a lot of professional
exams, grace periods, you basically

28
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:41,450
testing the waters and then eventually
choosing one and that that's what I did.

29
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:45,540
I worked with a lot of outsourcing
companies along the years.

30
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:46,910
And about a year ago,

31
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:51,550
I found an outsourcing company
that now I can call my partners.

32
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:59,910
And I'm working with them
like they were in my team.

33
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:01,260
It's about twelve people.

34
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:04,380
We're doing a lot of stuff every day.
