00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:04,519
Imagine that I've finished the Friendly
Chat app and I've already published it.

2
00:00:04,519 --> 00:00:08,320
At first, my user base is growing, but
now when I take a look at analytics,

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,470
I'm starting to notice a drop in
active users and user engagement.

4
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:14,330
Also, when I take
a look at the database,

5
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:18,500
I notice that users are sending
some very, very long messages.

6
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:21,036
My hypothesis is that when users
are chatting with friends,

7
00:00:21,036 --> 00:00:24,028
there's a good chance they don't
want to read an entire dissertation.

8
00:00:24,027 --> 00:00:25,305
[BLANK_AUDIO]

9
00:00:25,306 --> 00:00:27,025
Back in the FCViewController,

10
00:00:27,025 --> 00:00:31,617
the variable that handles message length
is set to a limit of 1,000 characters.

11
00:00:31,617 --> 00:00:34,738
And I wonder if these long messages
are what's causing a drop in user

12
00:00:34,738 --> 00:00:36,209
engagement.

13
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:39,460
This would be a great case for
using Remote Config to run an a/b

14
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:42,869
test to help find what is
the best message length.

15
00:00:42,869 --> 00:00:46,558
But for simplicity's sake, in
the example we're about to show, we'll

16
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:51,489
change the Friendly Chat message length
for all users and not groups of users.

17
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:54,358
Back in the Firebase console,
we can create a variable using

18
00:00:54,357 --> 00:00:57,259
Remote Config that'll allow
us to set the message length.

19
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:01,469
First, navigate to
the Remote Config tab, and

20
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:04,340
then we'll click
Add Your First Parameter.

21
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:08,022
I'm going to make a nod towards a text
messaging and certain bird themed

22
00:01:08,022 --> 00:01:13,039
service and try setting the friendly
message length value to 140 characters.

23
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,100
That seems like a tried and

24
00:01:14,099 --> 00:01:17,409
true amount of characters for
friends to use while chatting.

25
00:01:17,409 --> 00:01:18,808
Make sure the publisher changes.

26
00:01:20,019 --> 00:01:23,097
Great, now that Firebase console is
set up for Remote Configuration,

27
00:01:23,097 --> 00:01:24,390
let's dive back into the code
