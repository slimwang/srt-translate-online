1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The third reason the code might not have been covered is that the test suite might simply

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
just be inadequate, and if the test suite is inadequate, we have to decide what to do about it.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
So one option of course is to improve the test suites so that the code gets covered.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
The other option is not to worry about it, and of course, since it should in good coverage

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
could be difficult, it can easily be the case that we'll just decide to ship our software

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
without achieving a 100% code coverage, and there is nothing in here to be wrong with that

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
because coverage testing, like all forms of testing, is basically just a cost-benefit tradeoff.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
The question we have to ask is are we getting enough value out of

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
doing the testing to offset the cost of doing the testing.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
And so if we do ships software with uncovered code, we basically have to do

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
is admit to ourselves that we're perfectly okay with the fact that the customers who are on

12
00:00:36,000 --> 99:59:59,999
the receiving end of the software might be the first people who will actually run it.
