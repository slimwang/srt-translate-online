1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:05,250
There are three versions of the official
markets hypothesis that go from weak

2
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:10,160
to strong and we'll take a look
at them each one at a time.

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,810
The weak form of the EMH

4
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:17,740
says that future prices cannot be
predicted by analyzing previous prices.

5
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:20,980
The idea here is that the current price.

6
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:24,460
Reflects all information we might know.

7
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:27,320
So just by looking at these historical
prices you can't predict what

8
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:29,020
is going to happen next.

9
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:34,590
Notice, however,that this does
leave room potentially for

10
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:36,650
fundamental analysis.

11
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:41,950
The semi-strong version of the EMH
suggests that prices adjust immediately

12
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:44,460
to new public information.

13
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:48,750
So, for instance, when companies
have their quarterly reports, that

14
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:53,128
contain fundamental information, prices
react immediately to that information.

15
00:00:53,128 --> 00:00:55,990
So, if semi-strong is correct,

16
00:00:55,990 --> 00:01:01,360
that would seem to prohibit
even fundamental analysis.

17
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:03,480
There's one possibility left though.

18
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:08,530
One way that we might make money and
that is based on insider information.

19
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:14,090
Well, the strong version of the EMH
says we can't even make money on insider

20
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:15,410
information.

21
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:18,910
Prices reflect all information,
public and private.

22
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:22,570
So even if there's some secret
information within the company

23
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:25,660
that points to a higher price later.

24
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:29,660
The price will go up in
the face of that knowledge.

25
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:36,740
So, if the strong version of the EMH
is true, it is essentially impossible

26
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:42,040
to make money by holding a portfolio,
other than the market portfolio.

27
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:45,840
So let's recap each one
of these real quick.

28
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,640
The weak form says that

29
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:53,310
you can't predict future prices
by looking at historical prices.

30
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:56,210
It is silent on things
like fundamentals or

31
00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:59,390
insider information,
it's just about price.

32
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:01,668
You can't profit by looking
at historical price.

33
00:02:01,668 --> 00:02:05,920
Semi-strong says that public information

34
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:11,470
such as quarterly reports cause
the price to adjust quickly.

35
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:15,670
The price adjusts rapidly to
this new public information.

36
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:20,180
So semi-strong essentially says that
even fundamental analysis won't work.

37
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:26,200
Finally, the strong version says
that even insider information

38
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:29,010
can't be leveraged to
profit in the market.
