1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:04,180
The fact is, essentially, any type of psychologist could examine this case.

2
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:08,270
However, the specific question of why no one reacted when a lot of people saw

3
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:12,060
and heard it would be examined by a social psychologist. Cognitive

4
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:17,000
psychologists usually look at how people perceive things, remember things, how

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,150
they solve problems and things like that. And a developmental psychologist.

6
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:26,050
We'll look at how thought and behavior changes or remains the same across the

7
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:29,840
lifespan. So it might be confusing, because a clinical psychologist deals with

8
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:34,980
diagnosing mental illness. And in this situation may help to determine if the

9
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:39,890
attacker was mentally stable. But again, this question was focusing on why no

10
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:43,830
one helped. That could also be the case for a forensic psychologist. A forensic

11
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:46,670
psychologist might want to examine the person who committed the crime or the

12
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:51,530
crime itself. Now, the key here is that even though this question was directed

13
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:55,320
towards a social psychologist. A clinical or even a forensic psychologist could

14
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,440
also examine this case. But I'm going to send you to Greg to talk a little bit

15
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,140
more about forensic psychology.
