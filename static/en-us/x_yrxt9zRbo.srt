00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,972
So, we know the slope of our new line must be negative 3 halves and we have a

2
00:00:03,972 --> 00:00:08,211
point, so that means we can use point slope form to find the equation. Now that

3
00:00:08,211 --> 00:00:12,241
we know the slope and the point, we can use our point slope form to figure out

4
00:00:12,241 --> 00:00:16,430
the equation of the line. So I want you to figure this out. What's the equation

5
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:19,260
of our line in standard from? Write your answer here.
