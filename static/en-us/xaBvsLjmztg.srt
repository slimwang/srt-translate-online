00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,160
So we know that web application
code gets the information that it

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:06,870
needs to create websites by performing
CRUD operations on the database.

3
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:10,390
But how do we get an application and a
database to communicate with each other?

4
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:12,690
You already know that SQL
is the popular language for

5
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:14,420
communicating with databases.

6
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:17,570
From our application code,
we can create SQL commands and

7
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:20,140
decipher the results to integrate
back into our application.
