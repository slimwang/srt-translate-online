1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,912
So, market size doesn’t need to be a four-page

2
00:00:01,912 --> 00:00:03,913
business school analysis. So if you went to

3
00:00:03,913 --> 00:00:06,129
business school, feel free to do the analysis.

4
00:00:06,129 --> 00:00:08,780
But it really is at first a back of the envelope

5
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:12,193
calculation. Is this business worth doing?

6
00:00:12,193 --> 00:00:14,144
So we just kind of have you constantly

7
00:00:14,144 --> 00:00:16,129
checking about three things. And let’s take

8
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:18,695
a look at the Jersey Square team and think

9
00:00:18,695 --> 00:00:20,995
about how they approach this. If you

10
00:00:20,995 --> 00:00:22,760
remember we asked you to talk about the

11
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:24,860
total available market or total addressable

12
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:27,389
market, which really is a fancy word to say

13
00:00:27,389 --> 00:00:30,337
how big is the universe of everybody

14
00:00:30,337 --> 00:00:32,723
potentially who could use the product. And

15
00:00:32,723 --> 00:00:34,820
in this case they say well, even in the United

16
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:36,906
States there are 150 Americans who watch

17
00:00:36,906 --> 00:00:39,337
the five major team sports in some capacity.

18
00:00:39,337 --> 00:00:42,373
Okay, well, can we sell to 150 million people?

19
00:00:42,373 --> 00:00:46,091
Not really, because the next thing we want to

20
00:00:46,091 --> 00:00:48,256
look at is, what we call the served available

21
00:00:48,256 --> 00:00:50,375
market. How many can I reach with my sales channel?

22
00:00:50,375 --> 00:00:52,295
So, let’s see how the Jersey Square team

23
00:00:52,295 --> 00:00:54,229
looked at the served available market.

24
00:00:54,229 --> 00:00:56,268
They said in the New York Metro area,

25
00:00:56,268 --> 00:00:58,518
there were 11 million people who watch

26
00:00:58,518 --> 00:01:02,134
the five major sports teams in some capacity.

27
00:01:02,134 --> 00:01:04,382
What they really should have done is, said

28
00:01:04,382 --> 00:01:06,349
that, but then said how many of them have

29
00:01:06,349 --> 00:01:08,850
a web browser and how many of them will

30
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:11,583
we actually be able to reach within some

31
00:01:11,583 --> 00:01:14,550
period of time and with some semblance of

32
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:17,297
cash. And the next thing they were looking

33
00:01:17,297 --> 00:01:19,585
at was their target market. Who will be

34
00:01:19,585 --> 00:01:21,799
their most likely buyers?

35
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:23,403
And they did some research at Yankee

36
00:01:23,403 --> 00:01:27,250
Stadium and said 11% or 12% of the served

37
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:29,600
available market showed strong interest and

38
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,934
they said well that means just in the New

39
00:01:31,934 --> 00:01:34,565
York area 1.3 million people should be

40
00:01:34,565 --> 00:01:37,149
interested in a subscription or rental. Really,

41
00:01:37,149 --> 00:01:39,033
again if they were doing analysis for real,

42
00:01:39,033 --> 00:01:41,115
they should have said, but how many of

43
00:01:41,115 --> 00:01:42,759
them can we reach with a web browser

44
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:44,724
and then how many of them can we actually

45
00:01:44,724 --> 00:01:47,366
get with our acquisition and activation

46
00:01:47,366 --> 00:01:49,214
campaign. And what falls out of this,

47
00:01:49,214 --> 00:01:51,166
if you actually take it to the next level,

48
00:01:51,166 --> 00:01:54,182
is what’s a reasonable assumption of

49
00:01:54,182 --> 00:01:56,200
year 1, 2 and 3 revenue? Just back of

50
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,035
the envelope.

51
00:01:57,035 --> 00:01:59,564
Okay. So these are the people, gee, subscription

52
00:01:59,564 --> 00:02:02,467
and half pay rental, let’s do some math. My

53
00:02:02,467 --> 00:02:04,751
first year’s revenue should be $300 million.

54
00:02:04,751 --> 00:02:07,441
No, I think I am being a little too optimistic.

55
00:02:07,441 --> 00:02:08,828
At least you will start with a series of

56
00:02:08,828 --> 00:02:10,336
calculation that you could bounce off

57
00:02:10,336 --> 00:02:13,085
advisors and friends and cofounders and

58
00:02:13,085 --> 00:02:14,985
say, you know, are we even in the

59
00:02:14,985 --> 00:02:17,384
ballpark of making an interesting business.

60
00:02:17,384 --> 00:02:18,949
One of the things to keep in mind is that

61
00:02:18,949 --> 00:02:21,937
no startup has ever exceeded their optimistic

62
00:02:21,937 --> 00:02:23,893
estimates of market size. So if your numbers

63
00:02:23,893 --> 00:02:26,625
are coming in too low on potential customers,

64
00:02:26,625 --> 00:02:28,625
I wouldn’t give up, I would just be going

65
00:02:28,625 --> 00:02:31,175
back and looking at the customer segments

66
00:02:31,175 --> 00:02:33,160
you are targeting and understand whether

67
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,341
you want to build the business or have a hobby.
