1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:05,540
To showcase the importance of both the field of view and its relationship to

2
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:10,060
the focal length lens I'm going to show you a series of pictures a friend of

3
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:13,127
mine, a colleague of mine at Georgia Tech, Henry Christenson.

4
00:00:13,127 --> 00:00:15,860
Professor Christensen took from his apartment and

5
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:18,990
this would be actually interesting for all of you to see

6
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:23,150
interesting perspective of the Georgia Tech campus from the city of Atlanta.

7
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:26,010
Here is basically the focal of the camera we're using or

8
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:28,410
the lens we're using is 12 millimeter.

9
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:32,674
This is the view, 24 millimeter, 50 millimeter,

10
00:00:32,674 --> 00:00:36,170
85 millimeter lens, moving to a 116.

11
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:40,130
220 millimeter, all the way to 300 millimeters.

12
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:44,360
So we've gone from 12 millimeter to 300 millimeter, and now, of course,

13
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:49,380
you're seeing the iconic Georgia Tech tower in front of our football stadium.

14
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:52,520
Right behind was the Coca-Cola campus.

15
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:55,610
So this is an interesting way of kind of now showing you the values,

16
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:58,960
to field of views really kind of getting focused in.

17
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,150
Let's look at it a little bit in backward direction.

18
00:01:09,891 --> 00:01:10,833
And forward again.

19
00:01:18,889 --> 00:01:21,590
Let's look at the same images in a different form next.
