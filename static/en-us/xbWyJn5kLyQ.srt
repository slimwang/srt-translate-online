00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:04,860
In examples in previous lessons we have introduced to you

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:07,470
various ways of building models.

3
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:12,820
We investigated applicability and merits of the various models and

4
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:17,210
went through some of the steps of questioning and validation.

5
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:22,350
Iterating between these steps towards building the models.

6
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:28,160
In this lesson, we will take a deeper dive into the model validation process.

7
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,830
Before getting into this, let us think of a situation where we

8
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:37,620
want to teach a six year old how to multiply two numbers.

9
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:43,240
To do so, we show her how to multiply by using many pairs of numbers.

10
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:45,520
Let's say we use 100 pairs of numbers.

11
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:51,210
After a while we are convinced that she can multiply two numbers and

12
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:52,920
want to test her skill.

13
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:58,090
Now if we test her multiplication skills on the same numbers that we gave her

14
00:00:58,090 --> 00:01:02,930
to learn multiplication with there is always the possibility that she

15
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:06,880
did not figure out the underlying algorithms or

16
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:12,320
patterns for multiplying, but has simply memorized all the values.

17
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:17,470
A good test will be to ask her to multiply numbers she has not seen before.

18
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:22,310
We want to test how well she learned by giving her

19
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:25,260
data which she has never seen before.

20
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:29,990
A similar approach is required in testing models.

21
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:34,550
How well the model learns needs to be verified on

22
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:38,070
data that the model has not seen before.

23
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:41,740
It is like giving the model an exam or a test.

24
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:46,500
And the test scores give us a way of estimating how well the model will fare.

25
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:52,910
Much like we test children's ability to use the knowledge they learn in school

26
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:58,410
through tests and use the test scores to evaluate and rank their abilities.

27
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:01,750
So now that we know that we will need some data to

28
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:06,960
test our models we can either go and collect more data to test them.

29
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:12,400
Or simply set aside a part of the data that we have already collected for

30
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,480
the purpose of testing.
