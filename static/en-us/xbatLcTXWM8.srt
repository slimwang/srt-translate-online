1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
So, we have seen how to reduce an 800-line input to a single line

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
and even reduce this single line even further to 8 characters

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
that reproduce the bug.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
This is also what the Mozilla volunteers did,

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
and within one night the first volunteers already had earned their t-shirts.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
This is obviously simpler than 800-lines of HTML code,

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
but what is it that makes something simpler?

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Or when do we say that something is simpler than something else?

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
What is it that makes something simple?

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
First, there is the burden it takes to understand something.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
In debugging, an input that takes me 10 seconds to understand

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
is simpler than an input that takes me 10 minutes.

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
This is why one line of HTML is better than 800 lines of HTML,

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
because the one line of HTML has a far smaller burden to understand

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
why something went wrong.

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Second, the less burden it takes to explain something,

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
the simpler it is, or maybe the other way around.

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
If something is simpler, it takes less effort or explain something.

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
If I say Mozilla cannot print a select tag,

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
then it is way simpler than saying Mozilla can't print this Bugzilla page

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
with the following 800 lines of code.

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Plus, a short explanation also points me directly to the code in question.

23
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
If I know Mozilla can't print a select tag,

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I can go directly to the code in which Mozilla handles printing select tags.

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
All of his, however, refers to humans.

26
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
It is the human burden we're talking about.

27
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Things that are simple are easy to explain and easy to understand,

28
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
but what is complex to one can be simple to others and vice versa.

29
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
The same thing can be explained in simple terms and also in complex terms.
