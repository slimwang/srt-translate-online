00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,407
We know that this line represents this equation. So this line shows all of the

2
00:00:04,407 --> 00:00:08,823
pairs of x and y coordinates that satisfy this equation, make you see that the

3
00:00:08,823 --> 00:00:13,329
line is infinitely long, both in the negative and the positive directions. So

4
00:00:13,329 --> 00:00:17,684
thinking about what the situation we're dealing with and trying to represent

5
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:22,320
with this equation actually is. Especially keeping in mind what x and y both

6
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,536
stand for in the story with Grant, maybe you think that our graph is perfect

7
00:00:26,536 --> 00:00:30,984
just the way it is. You shouldn't change it. Maybe you think we should start at

8
00:00:30,984 --> 00:00:35,336
x equals 0 and continue upward, or maybe you think we should start at y equals 0

9
00:00:35,336 --> 00:00:37,519
and continue upward. Take your pick.
