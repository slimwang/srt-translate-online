1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:05,360
So, in summary, what I showcased today was basically the example, of how,

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:09,820
novel illumination, novel cameras, and generalized optics and stuff like that,

3
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:14,040
are foundational in the whole principle of computational photography.

4
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:17,310
We basically looked at one's example, dual photography, that actually

5
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:22,600
showcases how this be done to generate newer images, you are able to see a card,

6
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:26,260
which was not visible directly from where the camera was, but by just doing

7
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:31,020
control illumination and control capture, we can actually still indirectly

8
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:35,540
measure things that were not visible before to generate a novel image.

9
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:36,300
So in the next class,

10
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:39,150
I'm going to introduce the concept of computational photography with

11
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:42,730
another example, specifically we will look at panoramas.

12
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:46,380
The dual photography concept is really interesting and kind of makes you

13
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:50,710
want to think more about the extent of what computation photography can do,

14
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:53,420
more in the future and kind of things it's empowering.

15
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:56,390
Panorama, on the other hand, is much more real, it's something that's

16
00:00:56,390 --> 00:01:00,100
available to you already, so for example, if you have a mobile smart phone,

17
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:03,500
it already has software to do panoramas, but basically the goal for

18
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:07,910
us now would be, is to study,how, images are stitched together to generate

19
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:12,840
larger image and pretty much open the black box of what panorama software does.

20
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:17,110
We'll relate back to the principles of computational photography, and use that

21
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:21,430
to kind of understand more about what we can do with computational photography.

22
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:24,510
Again, I encourage you to look at the dual photography paper mentioned here,

23
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:27,840
and, of course, thanks to again people that I've been leveraging off

24
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,811
their work to kind of explain these concepts.
