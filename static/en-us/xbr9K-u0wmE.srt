1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,900
Now the proofs for showing undecidability are somewhat easier than showing NP completeness,

2
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:07,850
because basically, what we are doing is the following.

3
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:12,760
We start out with saying that for any computer program, we can decide a certain property

4
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:16,149
and then derive from that but then you could solve the halting problem.

5
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:18,670
And you have seen that this works with a lot of properties.

6
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:21,370
So deciding if the program will stop doesn't work,

7
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:25,350
deciding if the program is equivalent to another program doesn't work,

8
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:28,980
deciding if the program even does what it's supposed to do doesn't work.

9
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:33,130
Even though you might still feel somewhat cheated by the original halting problem proof,

10
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:37,370
you might be inclined to think that once you accept that

11
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:43,210
then there's actually not much you can decide about the properties of a program at least in general,

12
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:45,640
and it turns out that that is exactly true.

13
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:51,590
In 1953, Henry Rice after whom Rice's Theorem is named proofed that

14
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:57,000
basically you cannot use an algorithm to decide anything about the properties of a given program.

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,070
So we must be a little bit more formal about this property x thing here.

16
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:07,040
And Henry Rice used the notion of a functional property here.

17
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:13,280
Now, what is a functional property? Sounds very complicated. Actually, it's a very simple definition.

18
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,060
Any functional property has these two properties.

19
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:18,600
First, it describes how the output relates to the input.

20
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:23,800
So this is what we mean by behavior and that is important to how they relate to each other

21
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,900
not for example how much time we need or something like that.

22
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:31,970
And the second property is that there must be some programs that have this property,

23
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:34,210
and other programs that don't have this property.

24
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:38,180
So that when you look at all possible computer programs, some of them will have this property

25
00:01:38,180 --> 99:59:59,999
others won't so that it can basically distinguish between the two.
