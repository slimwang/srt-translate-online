00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,501
We've intercepted a secret message, but it's scrambled. You're going to write a

2
00:00:03,501 --> 00:00:07,672
for loop that prints every tenth letter, starting at the zeroth one. You'll use

3
00:00:07,672 --> 00:00:11,480
it to decode the secret message. This is the project you'll be working with.

4
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:15,990
The decoder tester has the string with the secret messages embedded in it.

5
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:20,065
You'll write code for the decoder class. So that you can use a decoder to

6
00:00:20,065 --> 00:00:24,520
decode messages. Here's the Decoder class, and here's the decode method that

7
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:26,219
you want to fill in.
