1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
All right--so let's do some swapping. So, here's how it works.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
We start out at the root where the problems is and we say "Okay."

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Well, what's the smaller of the two children and that's the 25

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
and we're going to need to swap the 50 and the 25 to fix things up at the root.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
We've bubbled that 50 down just a little bit.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
But now, we've created--well, kind of things are okay over here but not so okay over here.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
So, 50 is smaller than 56 but not in 26.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
We're going to have to swap 50 down with the smaller of it's two children.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
So, 50 and 26 are getting swapped. All right, so now, what horrible thing have we created now?

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Well, actually, things are pretty good now.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
This 50 is actually happy with respect to it's children, and if you're paying attention

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
to what's going on elsewhere in the tree, everything is okay now, all right.

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Because we didn't actually touched this sub-tree.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
It had the heap property? It still has the heap property.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
We've bubbled the 50 down into here but we only pushed it to the right.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
We didn't mess with this sub-tree, so that one is still okay.

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
And now, for more it is right now, everything is fine.

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,000
We've now established the heap property everywhere and 50 ends up in node 4 here.
