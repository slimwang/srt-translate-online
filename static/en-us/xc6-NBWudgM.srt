00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:02,960
Now it's time for our pop quiz to make sure everyone

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:07,500
understands pop. For this quiz, assume that the name p refers to

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:10,780
a list with at least two elements. Your goal is to determine

4
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:13,890
which of the code fragments does not change the final value of

5
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:16,870
p. And so that means no matter what value p starts with,

6
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:19,710
as long as it has at least two elements after executing the

7
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:22,890
code. And I'll show you the choices for the code next. The

8
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:25,720
value of the p is the same as what it started with.

9
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:28,110
So here are the choices. Check the box for each

10
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:30,760
code fragment where the value of p at the end of

11
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,740
the code fragment is the same as the value of

12
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:36,370
p beforehand, assuming that initially p has at least two elements.
