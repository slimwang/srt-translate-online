1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:04,557
So today we're with Dr., Erika Rosenberg. And she's an expert in the psychology

2
00:00:04,557 --> 00:00:08,890
of emotion and facial expression of emotion. So Erika, can you tell us

3
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:11,790
something about how you got into this field of study?

4
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:14,474
>> It's kind of interesting because it's not something I thought I would do when I

5
00:00:14,474 --> 00:00:18,832
was a kid. That I would study facial expressions of emotion. But if you look at

6
00:00:18,832 --> 00:00:22,540
my, my baby pictures, it might have predicted this. But, I was interested in

7
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:27,382
the effects of emotions on health. in, in general, I was interested in stress

8
00:00:27,382 --> 00:00:30,371
and health, I went to the University of California San Francisco in their

9
00:00:30,371 --> 00:00:35,120
Health Psychology program to get my PhD. After my first year, I met Paul Ekman

10
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:39,774
who was a professor there. And I found out he had really developed this field,

11
00:00:39,774 --> 00:00:45,286
of the scientific study of facial expressions of emotions. So, that's how I

12
00:00:45,286 --> 00:00:50,700
started working on it. I saw the face as a tool, to learn, to measure emotion.

13
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:54,988
From a purely research point of view. But, once I got into it, it led to this

14
00:00:54,988 --> 00:00:59,685
whole series of fascinating applications for studying the face.

15
00:00:59,685 --> 00:01:03,894
>> Well, can you tell us something about, what was some of the groundbreaking work

16
00:01:03,894 --> 00:01:06,410
that was done early on?

17
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:10,252
>> Right, right, right. I mean, it's interest in the face in studying emotion

18
00:01:10,252 --> 00:01:15,185
actually goes pretty far back. It started in the nineteenth century when

19
00:01:15,185 --> 00:01:18,683
Charles Darwin, published a book, you know, in 1872, called The Expressions of

20
00:01:18,683 --> 00:01:23,570
the Emotions in Man and Animals. Where he, he had all these wonderful drawings,

21
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:27,424
and photographs, of animals, and humans. A lot of the pictures were of his

22
00:01:27,424 --> 00:01:30,609
kids, making different emotions faces, and he was trying to make the argument

23
00:01:30,609 --> 00:01:35,515
that there's fundamental about how emotion is shown. Not just in humans but in

24
00:01:35,515 --> 00:01:40,214
a variety of animal species. That is, sort of inborn inate. And he had, he did

25
00:01:40,214 --> 00:01:43,427
very informal research methods of having people all over the world send him

26
00:01:43,427 --> 00:01:46,691
pictures from their journeys or drawings at the time, and saying, if you show

27
00:01:46,691 --> 00:01:52,379
these pictures to people, do they recognize them as the same ones we do. And

28
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:56,411
his anecdotal evidence We're pretty consistent that there was a small set of

29
00:01:56,411 --> 00:02:00,569
emotions that are conveyed with certain facial actions that's consistent for

30
00:02:00,569 --> 00:02:02,934
all humans.

31
00:02:02,934 --> 00:02:04,214
>> All over the world.

32
00:02:04,214 --> 00:02:08,294
>> All over the world. And his research methods were not real precise. And in the

33
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:12,001
early 20th century, this idea of things being in born, was not very popular

34
00:02:12,001 --> 00:02:17,997
because behaviorism was just getting going. And it took until The, the 1960s,

35
00:02:17,997 --> 00:02:25,056
actually when Ekman and Friesen did their pioneering work. Not just to other

36
00:02:25,056 --> 00:02:28,143
industrialized nations, because they'd found some agreement consistent with

37
00:02:28,143 --> 00:02:33,016
Darwin's, in industrialized countries. But they decided, if you really want to

38
00:02:33,016 --> 00:02:36,670
find out if something's innate, not learned, then you have to go to cultures

39
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:39,860
where they're not sharing the kind of information that we share in

40
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:46,172
industrialized nations. So he went with an anthropologist friend to Papua New

41
00:02:46,172 --> 00:02:51,370
Guinea, which at that time, no longer, was a preliterate culture. They didn't

42
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:55,600
have exposure to any western films or whatever. And, Ekman and Friesen showed

43
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:59,630
members of two different tribes there, some of the photographs they'd used of

44
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:03,660
certain poses of facial expression of emotion, but most of those people were,

45
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:09,941
you know, European-American looking. So they also gathered photos from the New

46
00:03:09,941 --> 00:03:14,783
Guineans themselves, and used a variety of different methodologies. And

47
00:03:14,783 --> 00:03:18,626
surprised both Eckman because he didn't expect to find this, and the scientific

48
00:03:18,626 --> 00:03:22,530
community that there were about five or six different emotions for which the

49
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:28,628
facial configurations were consistency recognized the same. Both in you know,

50
00:03:28,628 --> 00:03:32,447
at the time, Eckman was in Berklely. Berkely, California. And of Papua New

51
00:03:32,447 --> 00:03:35,860
Guinea. So that seemed to speak very powerfully to the idea that there were

52
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:41,352
universal facial expressions of emotions. But this was a small set. So, we're

53
00:03:41,352 --> 00:03:46,044
talking about anger, fear, disgust, happiness, sadness and surprise, about six

54
00:03:46,044 --> 00:03:50,144
emotions. To model these universal expressions, I'm going to need to take my

55
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:54,712
glasses off. Now the important thing to remember is that these are prototypes

56
00:03:54,712 --> 00:03:57,998
so like any prototype this is sort of like a classic just like a, an apple's a

57
00:03:57,998 --> 00:04:03,658
classic fruit and there's other fruits that are not you know as typical. This

58
00:04:03,658 --> 00:04:06,934
is sort of the prototypical example of each of these emotions that I'm going to

59
00:04:06,934 --> 00:04:11,430
show you. So I'll start with anger. Anger the brows are lowered, the upper

60
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:16,260
eyelid is lifted, the lower eyelid is tense, and the lips are pressed together.

61
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:22,284
So I can't talk while I do that so I'll do this. That's anger.

62
00:04:22,284 --> 00:04:22,522
[LAUGH]

63
00:04:22,522 --> 00:04:31,668
This is disgust. A key sign of disgust is the wrinkling of the nose. Fear.

64
00:04:31,668 --> 00:04:48,692
Happiness. Sadness. And surprise. And this is an emotion that later work has

65
00:04:48,692 --> 00:04:52,346
suggested is likely to be universal or at least has some good cross cultural

66
00:04:52,346 --> 00:04:58,882
agreement, and that's the emotion of content. Which is the only of the set of

67
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:05,198
universals that is only, really, a unilateral or asymmetrical expression.

68
00:05:05,198 --> 00:05:12,984
That's contempt. So. But contempt wasn't one of the emotions they used in the

69
00:05:12,984 --> 00:05:13,959
early word.
