00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:05,090
As we have discussed,
iOS requires military code signing.

2
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:09,170
This means that, apps that come
with the device, such as MAL or

3
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:11,380
Safari, are signed by Apple.

4
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:15,240
And the third party apps
must be verified and

5
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:19,010
signed, using
an Apple-issued certificate.

6
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:24,030
Now let's take a look at the process
by which a third party app developer

7
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:27,520
can obtain the Apple issued certificate.

8
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:30,640
In order to develop apps on iOS devices,

9
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:35,650
developers must register with Apple and
join the iOS Developer Program.

10
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:40,170
The real world identity of each
developer, whether an individual or

11
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:45,950
a business, is verified by Apple
before their certificate is issued.

12
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:49,380
This certificate enables
developers to sign apps and

13
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:52,670
submit them to the app store for
distribution.

14
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:53,830
As a result,

15
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:58,570
all apps in the app store have been
submitted by an identifiable person or

16
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:04,310
organization, serving as a deterrent
to the creation of malicious apps.

17
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:09,160
Furthermore, all apps in the app
store have been reviewed by Apple,

18
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:12,350
to ensure that they
operate as described, and

19
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:15,670
don't obtain obvious bugs or
other programs.

20
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:22,010
IOS devices are only allowed to download
apps from the official Apple app store.

21
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:27,490
And because of this restricted app
distribution model, plus co-signing,

22
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:31,950
it is very difficult to upload
malware to the app store and

23
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:34,410
have devices download such malware.
