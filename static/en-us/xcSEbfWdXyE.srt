00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,250
Underneath the division sign, we need to leave room for the x squared and x

2
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:08,356
terms, even though their coefficients are zero. So, we'll write x cubed plus

3
00:00:08,356 --> 00:00:13,380
zero x squared, plus zero x plus 1. The x plus 1 doesn't need any changing at

4
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:17,530
all. We can just write it as is outside the division sign.
