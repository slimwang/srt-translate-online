00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,277
This time we have a difference of 2 cubes, and the thing that's playing the role

2
00:00:05,277 --> 00:00:10,087
of the y cube down here is 125z cubed. This means, that anywhere I have y

3
00:00:10,087 --> 00:00:14,984
written up here in the general form, I need to write the cube root of 125z

4
00:00:14,984 --> 00:00:19,715
cubed, the cube root of 125 is 5 and the cube root of z cubed is just z so y

5
00:00:19,715 --> 00:00:24,943
will be replaced by 5z. Now, instead of z cubed, which was subtracted initially,

6
00:00:24,943 --> 00:00:29,643
we have 1, which means that instead of z, I'll put a 1. So again, like I said in

7
00:00:29,643 --> 00:00:34,869
the question video, the z cubed up here, in this expression we're interested in,

8
00:00:34,869 --> 00:00:40,010
is not at all related to the z cubed in the general expression. These are just

9
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:45,933
placeholder names. Okay, let's plug this stuff in. The thing in the form of y

10
00:00:45,933 --> 00:00:51,573
minus z down here is 5z minus 1 and our trinomial is going to be 25z squared

11
00:00:51,573 --> 00:00:55,294
plus 5z plus 1. Awesome. That was really great.
