1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,190
And the thing is all three are correct.

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:08,740
So, 40 throws, no six, the chances of that are actually smaller than 0.1%,

3
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:10,910
but that does not mean that it can't happen.

4
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:12,510
So, it can happen by pure chance.

5
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:14,590
Of course, you could also have the case that

6
00:00:14,590 --> 99:59:59,999
something is wrong with the die or somebody is cheating.
