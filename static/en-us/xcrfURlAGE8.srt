1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,550
The correct answer is all of the above.

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:06,430
The link in the instructor's notes
point to a paper on this topic.

3
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:10,310
The researchers were able to upload
malware to the Apple Apps store,

4
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:14,600
because the Apple Apps store
review process is not bulletproof,

5
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:19,280
which means that a malware can be
disguised and pass the review process.

6
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:23,169
And the Sandbox implementation has
security bugs that can be exploited by

7
00:00:23,169 --> 00:00:25,840
the malware to bypass
the Sandbox security.

8
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,430
Similarly, browser is a piece
of very complex software and

9
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:31,150
also has security bugs.

10
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:35,130
So again, the malware was able
to hijack the browser and

11
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:36,770
collect users' passwords.
