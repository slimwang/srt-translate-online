00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:04,170
Now, recall in the previous lecture, I
talked about the whole process of how we

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:08,790
think corners are an important
type of a feature.

3
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:11,070
And we actually looked
at this entire equation,

4
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:15,740
that basically gave us a way of looking
over an image by shifting it and

5
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:19,160
using that shifting to be
able to find a corner.

6
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:21,240
And again,
these were shifting the gradients.

7
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:24,770
Being able to move an image or
move a region over and

8
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:27,440
seeing if there's a change
in different directions, and

9
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:30,880
we computed all kinds of
information to support it.

10
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,100
So use it in this equation for
corner detection.

11
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:36,940
Just leverage the quadratic
approximation,

12
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:41,060
using the Taylor Expansion which
gives us another equation.

13
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:45,090
Which results in this simpler form,
and again it's not in a matrix and

14
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:45,850
vector form.

15
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:48,570
And M is the matrix that we
now actually want to compute,

16
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:52,260
because that'll allow us to do the
computations that we wanted to do here.

17
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:56,501
Just recall again,
M is the second moment matrix,

18
00:00:56,501 --> 00:01:00,854
computed from an image using
derivatives Ix and Iy.

19
00:01:00,854 --> 00:01:04,226
So again, we compute
the derivatives of an image and

20
00:01:04,226 --> 00:01:07,842
using that we can actually
now compute a moment matrix.

21
00:01:07,842 --> 00:01:11,680
And that allows us to now do this
computation in a much simpler manner.
