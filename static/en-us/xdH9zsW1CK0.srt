1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:01,910
Cookie is a small piece of data stored in

2
00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:04,640
the browser for a website. And by small, I

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:07,970
mean less than four kilobytes. And in practice, we're

4
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:10,830
only talking about 100 bytes, just a small you know,

5
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:14,500
really just a string. It takes the format conceptually

6
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:17,660
is something like this, name equals value. And in practice

7
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:21,360
it may look something like this, user.id equals 12345.

8
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:25,190
Cookies are really commonly used for things like user IDs

9
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:29,540
and, and you know, kind of temporary information that, that a

10
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:32,566
browser wants to store, you know, whether you're logged into a website.

11
00:00:32,566 --> 00:00:35,240
You know, generally, you, you have a cookie that represents the, the

12
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:39,270
fact that you're logged in as user, you know, 12345. So to

13
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:40,900
kind of draw you a little picture of how these things

14
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:43,460
fit together, you know, we might have your browser, and it makes

15
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:46,920
requests, you know, to some web servers. And a web server might

16
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:50,220
send back, in it's response, some cookie data, and this is in

17
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:53,530
the form of an HTTP header. And then your browser

18
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:57,580
basically just stores this cookie, it's associated with this website.

19
00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:00,900
We'll talk more about that shortly. And then every time

20
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:03,462
your browser makes a request to this website in the

21
00:01:03,462 --> 00:01:06,024
future, now that it has this cookie, it will, it

22
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:09,218
will send the cookie back to the server. So, you

23
00:01:09,218 --> 00:01:11,944
know, if you are logging in, you might, you might

24
00:01:11,944 --> 00:01:14,844
post some form here and the server might respond with okay,

25
00:01:14,844 --> 00:01:18,680
welcome to our website you are user 12345. And then on

26
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:22,620
every future request, you say, hey, I'm user 12345. And that's

27
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:25,450
how the website knows that you're logged in. And a cookie,

28
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:28,400
you know, is, is just basically a file that your browser stores.

29
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,360
Generally, you can store about, about 20 cookies per website. Now,

30
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,723
this is basically up to the browser. It's some sort of,

31
00:01:34,723 --> 00:01:37,490
it, it, it's a browser limitation. Another limitation is probably the

32
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:40,430
length of the cookie, which we said is less than four k,

33
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:42,660
but in reality [LAUGH], you know, this is this is

34
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:45,030
five bytes. And we're probably, you know, most of the

35
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:48,560
cookies we're storing are not, you know, thousands of bytes.

36
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,630
Another limitation is a cookie has to be associated with a

37
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:55,536
particular domain. So, you know, a cook, a cookie for

38
00:01:55,536 --> 00:01:59,745
udacity.com is only sent to you to udacity.com and, and udacity.com

39
00:01:59,745 --> 00:02:03,340
can only set cookies for udacity.com. So, it's, each website

40
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:05,590
has you know, a few cookies that it can store that

41
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:08,080
are private for that website. A lot of this depends

42
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,609
on the browser to behave properly. So, you know, this

43
00:02:11,609 --> 00:02:15,550
20 cookies per website that's an old Internet Explorer limitation.

44
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:18,590
Honestly I don't know what the limit is for modern browsers.

45
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:20,590
But if you're storing more than 20 cookies on, on

46
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:23,050
a particular domain, you'll probably rethink things a little bit.

47
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:25,810
You know, maybe store more data in, you know, in

48
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:30,690
a, a single cookie. The four kilobytes, again, there, there's so

49
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:32,570
many things that can go wrong when you start sending big

50
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:35,260
cookies that are, you know, 4000 bytes long. You know, you can

51
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:36,965
set, some, some browsers don't handle

52
00:02:36,965 --> 00:02:39,230
multi-line cookies properly. Some web servers

53
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:42,910
don't handle multi, multi-line cookies properly, so I would suggest keeping it

54
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:45,210
short and simple. And, and most of our use cases are for

55
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:48,790
storing small pieces of data that you don't want to store in a

56
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:52,630
database. It's easier to just store them in a cookie. Or, you

57
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:55,810
know, small pieces of, you know, temporary data that is, that is

58
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:59,010
only relevant to this particular user in this particular browser right

59
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:03,670
now. Now this, this constraint, you know, a cookie being associated

60
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:07,120
with pick your website is, is important. It prevents you know,

61
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,300
me from, you know, the, the cookie is, is, is what makes

62
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:13,110
me be logged in at a lot of websites, so. If

63
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:15,420
another website could forge this cookie or read this cookie, you know,

64
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:17,672
they could pretend to be me on another website. You know,

65
00:03:17,672 --> 00:03:20,850
they could steal my log in information. So cookies, the, the domain

66
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:24,090
that cookie belongs to is, is really important. But it's up to the browser to

67
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:26,980
enforce those rules. And sometimes browsers have bugs

68
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:27,950
you know, none of the modern ones do.

69
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:29,120
I can't remember the last time that happened.

70
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,210
But you know, it's just something to be

71
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,820
aware of. These are, this is all kind

72
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:35,230
of browser side, you know, client side, enforced
