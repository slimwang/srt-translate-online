00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,310
To test this architecture
on real devices,

2
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:07,140
let's use WEBPAGETEST to take
a look at the weather app that

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:10,170
you're going to be building
throughout this course.

4
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:15,660
First, let's try using a Nexus 5
on a typical cable connection.

5
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:18,496
We did a lot of work to
optimize the app, but

6
00:00:18,496 --> 00:00:23,660
it still takes 1.1 seconds until
there's anything on screen.

7
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:27,340
And it takes 1.9 seconds to
completely render the page.

8
00:00:29,065 --> 00:00:34,375
Thanks to service workers, a repeat
visit achieves it's first meaningful

9
00:00:34,375 --> 00:00:40,105
paint after only 0.3 seconds and
is finished rendering at 0.6 seconds.

10
00:00:41,685 --> 00:00:44,545
What about on a slower connection?

11
00:00:44,545 --> 00:00:48,195
Let's try using a Nexus 5
on a typical 3G connection.

12
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:53,670
The first time to meaningful
paint is now three seconds, and

13
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:57,560
it took five seconds until
everything is finished rendering.

14
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,850
Here's where we really see
the performance improvements of

15
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:04,390
service workers.

16
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:09,615
A repeat visit with service workers
enabled takes only 0.3 seconds for

17
00:01:09,615 --> 00:01:16,160
the first meaningful paint and
0.5 seconds until it's finish rendering.

18
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,760
On a 3G connection
using service workers,

19
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:22,240
we got a ten x performance boost.

20
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:27,120
The visual complete event went
from 5 seconds to 0.5 seconds.

21
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:30,890
If you have users on Edge,
the results are even more drastic.

22
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:35,064
Instead of taking 13 seconds
to complete rendering,

23
00:01:35,064 --> 00:01:39,160
everything is now rendered
in 0.8 seconds, nice.
