You've just seen how to implement the drive method so that it updates the gas

2
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:08,430
used. And there were two kinds of variables in that method. Let me show you.

3
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:12,725
Over here, you see an instance variable. And inside the body of the drive

4
00:00:12,725 --> 00:00:18,080
method you see a different kind of variable called a local variable. What's the

5
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:18,550
difference?
