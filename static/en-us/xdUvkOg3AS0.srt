When we sleep, our body works to restore itself after a long day of neural

00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:08,820
activity. In fact, the brain can use up to 80% of its energy to sustain

00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:14,174
synaptic activity. The brain needs a way to conserve energy after a long day of

00:00:14,174 --> 00:00:18,844
wakefulness in physical an mental activity. Sleep also helps us in memory

00:00:18,844 --> 00:00:23,058
consolidation, and learning. And finally, sleep is really important for neural

growth, as we've discussed before.
