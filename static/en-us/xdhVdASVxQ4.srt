We need to add something to this
empty Bond Villain storyboard.

2
00:00:03,404 --> 00:00:06,338
Let's start by outlining the steps
required to set up a table and

3
00:00:06,338 --> 00:00:08,930
connect it to the villain
view controller.

4
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:12,130
Step one, add a table to the main view.

5

Step three, connect the table's data
source property to the view controller.

7
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:27,040
Four, create a prototype cell and
five, set the cell's reuse identifier.
