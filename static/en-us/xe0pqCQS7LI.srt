1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:05,810
Okay so we just have one lesson
that covers law ethics and

2
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:11,020
privacy so we not talking about
any of these in great detail.

3
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:15,970
As I said, I only talked about two of
the laws, I didn't get into privacy.

4
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:22,440
But we do want to very briefly talk
about some of ethics related to.

5
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,170
Online activities.

6
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:28,440
So what's the difference
between laws and ethics?

7
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:32,100
We know that ethics have
to do with sort of,

8
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:35,820
an individual's sense of
what is right and wrong.

9
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:42,630
On the other hand, laws are sort of
societal, we as a society decide state,

10
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:49,520
local, or federal, whatever it
is laws that say what is wrong.

11
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,020
If you did that, you would have
certain kind of sanctions.

12
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:56,870
Laws may not cover certain things,
but your sense of right and

13
00:00:56,870 --> 00:01:00,060
wrong might say well I
should not be doing this.

14
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,610
And we talking about that.

15
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:08,100
In the context of what we do online or
what we do in cyber space.

16
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:12,200
Before we sort of go further,
it's worthwhile pointing out

17
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:17,020
that when it comes to your ethical
sort of your sense of right and wrong,

18
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:22,390
of course there is no external
arbiter or enforcement agency like

19
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:28,200
law where we have police and
the courts and things like that.

20
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:35,110
So what's sort of the example of an
ethical code that you could think about?

21
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:39,070
So what happens if you
discover a vulnerability in

22
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:42,100
a commercial product that's used
by lots and lots of people?

23
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:46,050
What is ethical disclosure
of this vulnerability?

24
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:48,970
So here is the idea and the dilemma.

25
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:52,890
If you disclose it,
it's disclosed to the bad guys.

26
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:55,190
The bad guys can then exploit it.

27
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:56,950
And then can go and

28
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:02,520
attack the system in which you have
discovered a vulnerability, okay?

29
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:07,430
So that said, maybe disclosing
it is not a great thing,

30
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:11,250
the other way to think about this
is that if you don't disclose it

31
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:14,230
that doesn't mean that the bad guys
actually you want to find out about it.

32
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:19,140
And if you don't disclose it, then,
there's no pressure on the vendor who

33
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,330
actually produced this
commercial system or

34
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:23,910
product to actually do
something about it, okay?

35
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:27,640
So, by disclosing,
you sort of fix in with problem or

36
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:31,110
vulnerability we have,
hopefully in a timely fashion.

37
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:36,380
But at the same time, you're also making
this information available to bad guys.

38
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:39,060
So that's where do you draw the line?

39
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:41,490
What's the ethical thing to do here?

40
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:44,850
So of course, we have our personal
notion of right and wrong.

41
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:50,180
So, it could be sort of your
personal thing or it could be a code

42
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:56,310
of conduct defined by some professional
society that you may be a member of.

43
00:02:56,310 --> 00:03:00,310
So ACM or I triple E,
or even Georgia Tech.

44
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:07,154
So ethical standards are, in a court
of conduct, doing the right thing.

45
00:03:07,154 --> 00:03:11,580
Knowing what's right and
what is wrong of course, laws and

46
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:16,890
ethics go together to help
us understand what is that

47
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:22,050
we can do without doing anything
illegal or doing anything wrong versus

48
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:25,750
what is that should not be done
because that's the wrong thing to do.
