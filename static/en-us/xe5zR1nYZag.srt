1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,830
Well, this is an obvious one, isn't it? The first

2
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:05,040
thing to look for is the size of the area

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,820
we have to paint. In this case, both divs are

4
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:12,410
100 by 100 pixels. Now, let's look at what we're

5
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:16,250
painting. The second div is just a square filled with

6
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:19,550
white pixels. Now compare this to the first div. Here

7
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:22,340
we have a transparent background and we also need to

8
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:25,480
render an inset shadow. As a result, the second div is

9
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:28,060
definitely cheaper and faster to paint.
