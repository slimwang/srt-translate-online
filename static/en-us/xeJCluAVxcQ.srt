00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:04,580
Here I have a simple example of an app built with Knockout.

2
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:06,490
This example was built by Ryan Niemeyer,

3
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:10,100
and you can find the link to it in the instructor notes.

4
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:10,780
In this app,

5
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:14,180
we have a button and a number that updates when you press the button.

6
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:18,430
If you click the button too many times, it notifies you and

7
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:21,800
lets you reset with a different button.s Now, rather than show you

8
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:26,090
the example code here, I'm going to copy all of this into Sublime Text.

9
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:30,160
Now, I'm not going to pay any attention to the CSS in this example,

10
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,050
just the JavaScript and the HTML here.

11
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:36,450
I'm also going to change this to say Click rather than Click me.

12
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:38,740
That way, we can see this entire line.

13
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:42,090
Let's pay special attention to the HTML in this example.

14
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:45,650
The counter is a span with a data attribute on it.

15
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:50,920
Now, the buttons and the notification area all have data-bind attributes too.

16
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:54,420
And it's those data-bind attributes that connect up

17
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:57,550
the view with the rest of the application.

18
00:00:57,550 --> 00:01:02,210
Knockout reads these and starts watching the buttons and updating the views.

19
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:04,180
Now let's go through these one by one.

20
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:08,708
Our counter here says data-bind equals text: numberOfClicks, so

21
00:01:08,708 --> 00:01:11,880
let's remember that name right there.

22
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,340
If we look at the JavaScript,

23
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:18,540
you'll find numberOfClicks is actually a ko.observable.

24
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:21,220
Now, we don't quite know what that means yet.

25
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:23,360
We'll talk about that in the next lesson.

26
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,732
But the point is, that's the way things are connecting up.

27
00:01:26,732 --> 00:01:30,950
The data-bind attribute here is the way we tell Knockout that we

28
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:35,860
always want that span to show the value of numberOfClicks.

29
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:38,111
Whenever numberOfClicks here changes,

30
00:01:38,111 --> 00:01:41,460
Knockout will change the view automatically.

31
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:43,960
Now let's look at the Click me button here.

32
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:46,329
Its data-bind attribute says,

33
00:01:46,329 --> 00:01:51,610
click: registerClick, disable: hasClickedTooManyTimes.

34
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:54,140
It's important to notice the comma right there.

35
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:58,010
This and this are two separate bindings.

36
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:02,310
What these bindings are saying are, if the user clicks on this button,

37
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:07,040
run the registerClick function over in the view model and

38
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,640
disable the button when hasClickedTooManyTimes is true.

39
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,480
And sure enough, if we pop over here,

40
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:18,510
we'll see that registerClicks is indeed a method on the view model.

41
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:24,000
And we'll also notice that this.hasClickedTooManyTimes is something too.

42
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,090
This is a ko.computed, and that we're also going to talk about in the future.

43
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:30,760
Don't worry about it too much.

44
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:37,340
If we hop back to the HTML, let's see if you can guess what this and this do.
