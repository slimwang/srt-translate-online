1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,880
Now let's look at different data set.

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:04,200
Let's take myself.

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:05,720
I have a very different taste so

4
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:11,040
in my world I don't like the song Let It Go. But here's my situation.

5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,700
I'm much more scattered in the way I look at songs.

6
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:16,340
If I now hear this new song right over here what do

7
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:19,060
you think is the best answer just looking at the data.

8
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:20,580
Do I like this new song?

9
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:21,890
Do I not like it?

10
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:23,940
Or is this plainly unclear?

11
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:24,800
Take your best guess.
