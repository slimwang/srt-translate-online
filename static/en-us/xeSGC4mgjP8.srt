00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:04,150
There are actually several ways in which
Objective C can be characterized as more

2
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:05,950
dynamic than Swift.

3
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:10,470
The second has to do with how objects
are bound to the methods they invoke.

4
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:15,380
In Swift, method binding or method
resolution happens at compile time.

5
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:16,760
In Objective C,

6
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:20,270
methods in the objects invoking
them are not bound until runtime.

7
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:25,290
Let's imagine another array
holding objects of multiple types.

8
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:30,820
This time we have objects belonging to
the classes Puppy, Drum and Dealer.

9
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:33,970
Now let's imagine that we choose
an item from this array and

10
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:36,310
invoke the method, play.

11
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:40,050
Now, these three items actually
implement the method play in

12
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:41,550
three different ways,

13
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:45,640
which play the code is referring
to isn't known at compile time.

14
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:48,710
Coupling of method and
object doesn't happen until runtime.

15
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:54,250
And if we look in
the console we see Frolick.

16
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:56,490
Okay, that was Spot, the Puppy.

17
00:00:56,490 --> 00:01:00,440
And if we run it again we see,
Here's a card.

18
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:02,390
Okay, that was the Dealer.

19
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:07,070
And if we run it again,
we see ba-doom-cha, that was the Drum.
