At Udacity sometimes we have a little bit too much fun making memes.

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:06,810
In fact I just searched for

3
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:10,730
meme and all of these plus a lot more showed up in my inbox.

4
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:13,560
We apparently send these out all the time.

5
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:16,670
In fact one time James even sent out an entire email about

6
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:20,130
the programming language Swift using Taylor Swift memes.

7
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:22,470
So we, yeah, probably have too much fun.

8
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:25,330
I hear this one came out of web performance because I'm

9
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:26,920
making kind of a funny face.

10
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,240
No idea where this one came from but

11
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,490
that's Jared who makes classes at Georgia Tech.

12
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:35,450
This is Ben who's favorite thing in the world is to make Chrome extensions.

13
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:39,420
In fact, it comes up in almost every conversation about some type of

14
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:40,645
new technology.

15
00:00:40,645 --> 00:00:42,900
Ben'll be like, hey, I could make a Chrome extension for that.

16
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:45,330
So of course, I had to make a meme about him.

17
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:49,380
But I think my all-time favorite meme in my inbox is this one.

18
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:53,280
To give you a little bit of background we have Fancy Friday every other Friday,

19
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,820
where instead of trying to dress up like normal tech workers, who are always

20
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:59,940
wearing jeans and T-shirts, we try to put on something different, you know?

21
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:01,490
Wear something nice.

22
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:03,380
And this is David in the background here.

23
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:06,000
And I don't know what's going on here.

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,730
Apparently this is fancy.

25
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:09,500
But who knows?

26
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:12,310
So I've gone ahead and shown you some of our favorite memes.

27
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:14,810
But now we want to know what your favorite meme is.

28
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:18,500
Go ahead hop on the forums and post your favorite safe for work memes.

29
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:20,360
When you're done check this box to keep going.
