1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,716
The correct answers, at least according to me

2
00:00:02,716 --> 00:00:07,930
are: sending proper user-agents, very important, writing custom protocols,

3
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:09,270
no, you know, there is a time and a

4
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:12,570
place for it, generally using common protocols and data

5
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:16,309
formats is a better idea, using soap. [LAUGH] Depending

6
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:20,120
on whether we mean the protocol or the cleaning

7
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,320
substance. The correct answer may be yes or no.

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,230
We're going to go with the protocol, and say,

9
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:28,470
I wouldn't use it if I could avoid it. You might make, you might make somebody

10
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:31,090
at Hipmunk really upset. Or rate-limiting yourself, that

11
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:33,010
is also correct. You know, always be kind,

12
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:35,430
proper user agents, rate-limit yourself, use protocols and

13
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:36,940
data formats that everybody knows how to work

14
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:38,470
with that are easy to work with. Your

15
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:41,000
life and everybody else's online will be much easier.
