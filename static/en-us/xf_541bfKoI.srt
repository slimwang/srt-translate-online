1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:01,370
Here's the solution.

2
00:00:01,370 --> 00:00:04,282
To create your mLocationRequest,
you just simply call

3
00:00:04,282 --> 00:00:08,660
LocationRequest.create and
then to set the high accuracy priority,

4
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:12,195
you call LocationRequest.setPriority and
pass it a constant

5
00:00:12,195 --> 00:00:16,690
PRIORITY_HIGH_ACCURACY which you'll
find in the location request class.

6
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:20,950
You've already set the interval to 1000
milliseconds so then finally, all you

7
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:25,600
have to do on the FusedLocationApi
is requestLocationUpdates and

8
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:30,350
pass it to GoogleApiClient,
to LocationRequest, and this

9
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:34,908
referring to this activity so that the
call backs will come to this activity.

10
00:00:34,908 --> 00:00:36,850
All of these code should be on one line,

11
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:40,080
I've just broken it up into separate
lines here for easy reading.

12
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,900
Now because you were
requesting location updates,

13
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:47,470
you'll need to implement a call back
called on location changed which,

14
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:51,600
as its name suggests, will get
called whenever the location changes

15
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,470
even just a little with this interval
and this high accuracy determining that.
