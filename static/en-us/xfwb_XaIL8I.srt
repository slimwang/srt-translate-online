1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
With this algorithm in hand, we can actually do some useful analysis

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
beyond just discovering things about the size of the components.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
So what I'm going to ask you to do is to take the code that I wrote

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
and see if you can call it in a way that will answer this question.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
We're given a graph G that includes a node v1 and a node v2.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
We want to call mark_component

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
and use that to discover whether or not there is some path--even if we don't know what it is--

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
but some path that takes us from v1 through the graph to v2.
