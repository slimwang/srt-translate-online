00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,260
>> Well with Zuckerberg, there is an outlier here, so C must be the box plot

2
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:09,012
that corresponds to this distribution with Mark Zuckerberg, and without Mark

3
00:00:09,012 --> 00:00:13,942
Zuckerberg, it'll look pretty much the same. The interquartile range as you saw

4
00:00:13,942 --> 00:00:18,486
before will remain the same, as will the min and maximum value, not including

5
00:00:18,486 --> 00:00:23,083
Mark Zuckerberg. In this one, since it's more spread out and it has a larger

6
00:00:23,083 --> 00:00:28,552
interquartile range. Corresponds to this dot plot. Of course, these values would

7
00:00:28,552 --> 00:00:33,388
have to be exactly placed on a number line for it to be an accurate box plot.

8
00:00:33,388 --> 00:00:38,399
But in general, this is how the box plots will look differently from each other

9
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:40,434
for different distributions.
