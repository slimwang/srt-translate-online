00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,510
Our Main Activity class will
use the Google Services and

2
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:05,390
the Google API Client in the way that
you're probably familiar with by now.

3
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:07,500
And, the first thing that
you're going to need to do is,

4
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:11,290
on the Class Declaration, you have to
implement onConnectionCallbacks and

5
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:13,330
onConnectionFailedListener.

6
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:14,330
Once these are added,

7
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:17,910
the class will then expect a number
of overrides to be implemented.

8
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:21,660
These are onConnected,
onConnectionSuspended, And

9
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:23,340
onConnectionFailed.

10
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:26,290
So, go ahead an implement these
now on your main activity, and

11
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:27,500
check this box when you're done.
