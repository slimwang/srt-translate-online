00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,364
So we've looked at radical form throughout this lesson. We know that this

2
00:00:03,364 --> 00:00:08,322
really represents a power divided by a root. We can also write radical form in

3
00:00:08,322 --> 00:00:12,750
exponential form using a fractional exponent. So lets work in the reverse

4
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:17,675
direction this time. Lets go from radical form to the exponential form. Try

5
00:00:17,675 --> 00:00:22,492
expressing each of these radicals with one fractional exponent. Be sure you

6
00:00:22,492 --> 00:00:26,930
raise the entire radical to the exponent. Keep in mind that when you have

7
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:30,514
something than just a variable and an exponent inside a radical, you'd erase

8
00:00:30,514 --> 00:00:35,581
this entire radical to the fractional exponent. Here we can also simplify

9
00:00:35,581 --> 00:00:39,180
further since the 4 m squared is the same thing as 2m raised to the second

10
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:46,456
power. 2 squared is 4 and m squared is m squared. We're raising the power to a

11
00:00:46,456 --> 00:00:51,470
power so we really multiply these powers together to get 2m to the 2 3rds.

12
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:55,488
These two should connect from what we know since. 2 m squared is 4 m squared,

13
00:00:55,488 --> 00:01:01,740
and then we have a root in our denominator, or a cube root. Take some time on

14
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:04,330
these, and when you're ready, enter your answers here.
