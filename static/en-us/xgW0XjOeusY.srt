1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:03,510
So as we saw in the demos, the cookies can have extra parameters,

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:04,720
not just the value.

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:07,870
So, let me, let me draw anoth, an, an example cookie for you.

4
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:10,220
Here's a, here's an example set cookie header for

5
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:13,260
setting this cookie, whose name is name, nice and confusing.

6
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:15,420
Whose value is Steve.

7
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:17,890
And now we've added a couple extra parameters.

8
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:20,025
We've got semicolon to end the value.

9
00:00:20,025 --> 00:00:22,490
We've added this domain parameter.

10
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:27,220
And this is what domain this cookie is relevant to.

11
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:32,280
So in this case, it is relevant to www.reddit.com and

12
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:35,130
this is the path that it's relevant to.

13
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:37,520
So the path is easier to explain.

14
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,310
basically, you can put whatever you want here and

15
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:41,060
then, in this case, this is the default path.

16
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:45,580
If you don't specify a path we just assume you mean slash.

17
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:49,020
And this is actually the most common use case of cookies.

18
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:51,220
You the cookie applies to all of the paths.

19
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:54,750
But if you want to restrict the cookie to a particular path, you can specify

20
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:57,730
that path here and the browser will make sure that the path you're requesting

21
00:00:57,730 --> 00:01:00,310
starts with this value before it sends the cookie.

22
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:04,290
So the domain is much more interesting and much more complex.

23
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:09,120
And let's, let's talk about this a little bit so this means that basically, this

24
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:14,040
cookie will not get sent by the browser to the server unless the server's domain

25
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:21,090
is www.reddit.com or basically, ends with www.reddit.com.

26
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:23,777
So, domains that this work for are, for

27
00:01:23,777 --> 00:01:28,256
example, www.reddit.com foo.www.reddit.com.

28
00:01:28,256 --> 00:01:33,184
Domains that, that will not receive this cookie, would be for

29
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:36,470
example just reddit.com without the ww, or

30
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:42,525
bar.reddit.com because this cookie was restricted to www, so basically,

31
00:01:42,525 --> 00:01:48,830
the, the site you're at has to begin, or I mean sorry end with www.reddit.com.

32
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:53,820
You can't set cookies to just .com, you have to have at least two periods.

33
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:58,350
So the minimum domain you can set a cookie for is .reddit.com.

34
00:01:58,350 --> 00:01:59,272
If you try to set for

35
00:01:59,272 --> 00:02:02,969
just reddit.com, the, that first period will automatically get added.

36
00:02:02,969 --> 00:02:03,953
That controls,

37
00:02:03,953 --> 00:02:07,971
the domain controls which domain a browser will send the cookie to.

38
00:02:07,971 --> 00:02:10,703
What about, you know, can, can I have can I

39
00:02:10,703 --> 00:02:14,620
have a web server at reddit.com that sets a cookie for google.com?

40
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:15,930
The answer is, no.

41
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:20,000
Similar to how the domain parameter restricts which domains a browser will

42
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,120
send a cookie to, the domain who's serving the request, the, the,

43
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,920
basically the domain of the web server, that, of,

44
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:30,560
of the webpage, you may only set a cookie to that domain or higher.

45
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:35,810
So if we're at www.reddit.com the browser will only accept cookies for

46
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:40,020
by default, www.reddit.com if there's no, no domain parameter.

47
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:42,430
If there is a domain parameter,

48
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:47,180
the only valid domains are www.reddit.com or reddit.com.

49
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:53,374
We can't set a cookie for bar.reddit.com or foo.reddit.com.

50
00:02:53,374 --> 00:02:57,787
And, and this is to prevent you know, if you have multiple websites,

51
00:02:57,787 --> 00:03:02,203
kind of sharing the same top-level domain, you know, halfspot.com for

52
00:03:02,203 --> 00:03:04,445
example, you know, you don't, I,

53
00:03:04,445 --> 00:03:08,750
I can't see a cookie on, in my app that affects the behavior of your app.

54
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:14,880
I can only set a cookie that get sent with www and with the top level.

55
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,920
That's how the domain restrictions work.

56
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,060
Let's have a little quiz.
