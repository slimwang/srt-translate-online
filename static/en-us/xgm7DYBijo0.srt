1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:00,770
Great.

2
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:03,412
So, now that we've learned the differences between author-driven and

3
00:00:03,412 --> 00:00:06,810
viewer-driven visualizations, let's go through an exercise.

4
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:09,930
In this exercise, we're going to be analyzing the narrative structure of

5
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:11,820
different visualizations.

6
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,560
We provided some examples for you, and we want you to

7
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:18,560
ask four simple questions and write your answers in the discussion form.

8
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,600
First, we want to know what is the narrative structure of

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,390
the visualization that you've chosen?

10
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:27,070
Secondly, how does the visualization lead you through the data?

11
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:28,180
Third question is,

12
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:31,690
what is the story being told with this particular visualization?

13
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:34,200
And last, how could this have been improved?

14
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,100
Please pick a visualization from the examples provided, and

15
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:39,145
answer these four questions in a discussion form.
