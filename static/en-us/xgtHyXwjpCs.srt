1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:03,555
This lesson is about sorting in
a distributed memory system.

2
00:00:03,555 --> 00:00:07,192
[SOUND] I know, I know.

3
00:00:07,192 --> 00:00:10,960
>> Why we gotta sort all the time?

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:15,512
>> Sorting is worse than
oatmeal cooked with water.

5
00:00:15,512 --> 00:00:19,009
[SOUND]
>> [LAUGH] Sorting is

6
00:00:19,009 --> 00:00:20,706
the opposite of fun.

7
00:00:20,706 --> 00:00:23,220
[LAUGH]
>> I'd rather jab myself in the eye with

8
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:26,235
a hot poker than learn yet
another sorting algorithm.

9
00:00:26,235 --> 00:00:30,360
>> [SOUND]
>> Sorting gives me a rash.

10
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:31,250
>> Sorting.

11
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:34,740
>> Okay.

12
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:36,090
Are you done whining?

13
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:38,240
Sorting is really important.

14
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:41,250
Not because you're going to go through
life with people asking you to write

15
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:42,410
sorting algorithms all the time.

16
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:46,160
It's partly because it's
a fundamental primitive.

17
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:50,150
for example, every time a map reduce
computation executes somewhere,

18
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:52,280
data is being sorted.

19
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:55,450
But more importantly, you should pay
attention to the sorting lesson because

20
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:59,140
it's good practice, for learning how
to think about algorithms in general.

21
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:04,200
And since it's a core part of CS101,
I think it's really helpful for

22
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:07,660
you to see how to sort in
different computing environments.

23
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:10,840
For example, sorting sequentially,
versus sorting for

24
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:15,070
a vector parallel system, versus sorting
for a shared memory system versus,

25
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:17,450
of course, distributed memory systems.

26
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:20,250
So, please do your best and
stick with it.

27
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:23,660
I think you'll be pleased to learn some
really neat ideas, especially when you

28
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:27,320
compare them to the ideas about sorting
that you probably already know.
