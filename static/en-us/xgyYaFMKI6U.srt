1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:05,042
Now find the slope of the regression line using the fact that we know that the

2
00:00:05,042 --> 00:00:09,890
slope is equal to a Pearson's r or the correlation coefficient times the

3
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:14,150
standard deviation of the y values divided by the standard deviation of the x

4
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:14,800
values.
