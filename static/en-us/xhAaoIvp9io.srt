00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
This is cool! You made it! You now understand the very basics of hypothesis testing.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
We talked about critical regions. We talked about null hypothesis.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
We defined the critical region in the one-sided test and in the two-sided test.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
And assuming that the null hypothesis was correct is the actual outcome

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
fell into the critical region, we become suspicious and reject the hypothesis.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Whereas, if it was 95% consistent with the null hypothesis,

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
we'd be okay and that's the essence of hypothesis testing.

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Next time we'll tie this concept together with confidence intervals

9
00:00:44,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and some of the more advanced statistic concepts we've learned when sampling from data.
