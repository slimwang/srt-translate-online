00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,600
There are times when you would
like to provide more information

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:04,200
on a notification on a wearable device.

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:08,390
In this example, we have a calendar
notification but it would be handy to

4
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:11,920
show some extra reminder notes
if the user swipes to the left.

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:15,800
Android wear supports a concept called
pages which allow you to add extra pages

6
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:18,820
of information to
a notification like shown here.

7
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:21,730
To do this, you just create
two notification objects.

8
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:25,030
Here's the first page and
this is the start of the second page.

9
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:28,800
And then here's the second part
of the second page where we

10
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:29,600
add the style to it.

11
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:33,040
And now we create a wearable extender.

12
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:36,430
We use add page to add the second
notification to it and

13
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:40,130
then we call extend to add this
all to the first notification.

14
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:42,860
Then issue the first notification page,

15
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:45,510
and there's no need to
issue the second one.

16
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:49,280
The notification will then show
up with the second page attached.

17
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,740
And note, that any extra pages added
will never appear on the phone.
