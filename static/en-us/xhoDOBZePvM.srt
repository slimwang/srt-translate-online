1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:01,839
So let's take a look at the mean.

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:04,410
This one will be a little more clear,
all right?

3
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:08,930
So, this is the equation just copied
from the previous slide to this slide,

4
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:10,930
all right, for mu plus.

5
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:15,080
Step with me,
I'm going to divide by m squared.

6
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:17,930
Okay?
So, when I divide by m squared, okay,

7
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:21,140
so you see,
I've just divided by m squared.

8
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:23,920
So, there's an m squared down here and
this m becomes m there, and

9
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,490
this becomes an m squared there.

10
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:26,390
Okay?

11
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:27,510
Cool.

12
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:30,150
So, what is that?

13
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:32,920
>> I have no idea.

14
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:34,880
>> Well yes you do, here it is.

15
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,850
Look, see this yt over m.

16
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:42,330
Remember, y measurement
was just m times x.

17
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:48,620
So, yt over m, that's
the measurement's guess of what x is.

18
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:52,430
All right, if you were looking just
at the measurement, that's its guess.

19
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:56,460
Now mu t minus, what's that?

20
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:00,120
What mu t minus is,
that was our prediction, right?

21
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,290
Our, that's the mean,

22
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:07,050
that's our best guess as to what
x actually is at time t okay?

23
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:08,856
So, we've got these two things in here,
right,

24
00:01:08,856 --> 00:01:11,350
we've got mu t,
which is our prediction, and

25
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:15,960
y over m, which is our measurements
guess, we have to somehow combine them.

26
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,470
Well how do we combine them?

27
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:20,950
Well, what's this value, right?

28
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:25,130
This is just sigma squared
divided by m squared,

29
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:30,700
that is the measurements
variance divided by m squared,

30
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:36,060
that's the variance if you were to
compute x just from the measurement.

31
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:40,065
So this guy right here, that's the x
computed just from the measurement.

32
00:01:40,065 --> 00:01:46,346
The variance of that is sigma squared m
over m squared because y was just mx.

33
00:01:46,346 --> 00:01:47,571
All right?

34
00:01:47,571 --> 00:01:52,357
So that quantity right there,
circled in blue, that's the variance of

35
00:01:52,357 --> 00:01:57,190
x computed from the measurement and,
what is the last term there?

36
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:59,080
Sigma t minus squared.

37
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,970
That's the variance of the prediction.

38
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:04,190
And you might say, well, so what?"
>> So what?

39
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:05,620
>> What do you mean so what?

40
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:06,680
No.

41
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:13,955
What this means is that the entire
mu t plus is just the average.

42
00:02:13,955 --> 00:02:18,080
It's a weighted average
of the prediction and

43
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,340
the best guess based
upon the measurement.

44
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:25,552
And so down here in the denominator,
that's just the sum of the weights.

45
00:02:25,552 --> 00:02:31,020
It is just a weighted average of
the prediction plus what the measurement

46
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:35,540
is telling you, which of course is what,
in some sense, the universe has to be.

47
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:37,250
Right?
The whole idea is you're making

48
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:38,890
a prediction,
you're getting a measurement.

49
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:42,000
Both of these are sources of information
and you want to integrate them
