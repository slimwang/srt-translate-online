1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,130
All right.

2
00:00:00,132 --> 00:00:04,353
If you said positive 2 for this exponent great work. When I multiply by a

3
00:00:04,365 --> 00:00:09,024
positive power of 10, I move the decimal two places right. For this next one I

4
00:00:09,036 --> 00:00:13,586
notice that my decimal point is here. I need to make it go to the left side of

5
00:00:13,598 --> 00:00:18,073
6. I know that my exponent needs to be negative since I'm moving my decimal

6
00:00:18,085 --> 00:00:22,895
left. If I go one spot The decimal would be here, but I need two more zeros. So,

7
00:00:23,001 --> 00:00:27,466
I'm going to go one, two, and the decimal will end up here. Remember, I add

8
00:00:27,478 --> 00:00:32,188
zeroes as place holders whenever I move the decimal. I move the decimal three

9
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:36,828
places to the left, so my exponent is negative 3. Okay, so, for this one, my

10
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:42,142
decimal starts here. I don't have anything after the decimal. And I notice that

11
00:00:42,154 --> 00:00:46,313
I need to move it to the left. So I'm going to go one, two, three, four. My

12
00:00:46,325 --> 00:00:52,370
decimal moved four spots to the left. So I have to have an exponent of negative

13
00:00:52,382 --> 00:00:57,974
4. And this case I want my decimal point to end up to the right of 6 and one

14
00:00:57,986 --> 00:01:03,111
more place, here. So I'm going to move it, one, two, And then I have to add 1

15
00:01:03,123 --> 00:01:08,039
more spot, where a zero would be as a place holder. So I moved it one, two,

16
00:01:08,158 --> 00:01:13,220
three, four spots. So positive 4 would be this exponent. Remember, positive

17
00:01:13,232 --> 00:01:18,711
exponents move our decimal place to the right. Negative exponents move the

18
00:01:18,723 --> 00:01:20,558
decimal place to the left.
