00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,469
While we're on the topic
of notifications,

2
00:00:02,468 --> 00:00:06,269
it's worth mentioning a special type
of service called a foreground service.

3
00:00:06,269 --> 00:00:09,619
One common example of a foreground
service is a music player that's able to

4
00:00:09,619 --> 00:00:12,199
play music long after
you've navigated away

5
00:00:12,199 --> 00:00:14,479
from the actual audio player activity.

6
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,750
Another example is when you get
directions via Google Maps after you've

7
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:18,789
closed the apps.

8
00:00:18,789 --> 00:00:22,210
If you've ever navigated somewhere
while Google Maps wasn't active,

9
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:24,750
you've used the Google
map foreground service.

10
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:27,009
So what is a foreground service?

11
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:30,260
And what makes these two
examples foreground services

12
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:32,859
as opposed to plain old
background services?

13
00:00:32,859 --> 00:00:36,780
A foreground service is a service that
the user is actively aware of because

14
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:41,939
Android requires that service post
a non-dismissible ongoing notification.

15
00:00:41,939 --> 00:00:45,609
They are typically used to show the user
the real-time progress of a long-running

16
00:00:45,609 --> 00:00:46,549
operation.

17
00:00:46,549 --> 00:00:48,750
Because these notifications exist,

18
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:52,090
the user can do some rudimentary
interactions with your service,

19
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:55,240
such as pausing the music, or
stopping the service entirely.

20
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:58,700
In addition, because the service is
doing something very visible and

21
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:02,850
likely important for the user, Android
will prioritize not shutting these

22
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:05,219
services down if the system
is memory constrained.
