00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,906
We just came to the conclusion that all real numbers are complex and all

2
00:00:03,906 --> 00:00:08,147
imaginary numbers are also complex. However, we also saw a different number

3
00:00:08,147 --> 00:00:12,372
earlier the one that motivated our entire discussion of complex numbers, but

4
00:00:12,372 --> 00:00:16,142
seemed to not fit into the category of real numbers, or the category of

5
00:00:16,142 --> 00:00:21,011
imaginary numbers perfectly. So, I think what we need is a general statement for

6
00:00:21,011 --> 00:00:25,610
the form of a complex number, which of these do you think is a way to write that

7
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:30,531
general form. Please note here that in all these answer choices a and b are real

8
00:00:30,531 --> 00:00:31,153
numbers.
