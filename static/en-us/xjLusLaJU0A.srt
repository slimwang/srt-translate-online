1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Well, let's go through it.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
This is, again, a tricky quiz because it requires two kinds of reasoning.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
each string, we have to figure out whether it's in r or not and also whether it's in P or not.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
We just saw in the previous quiz that unbalanced parentheses, like this single open,

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
are not in P. This is looking good so far.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
For it to be part of the answer we want, we'd have to show that it is in r.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
If we look carefully, in fact it is. Here's how I'm going to do it.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
For this first opening parentheses for this star, I'm going to repeat it one time.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Then for this closing parentheses for this totally different star,

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I'm going to repeat it zero times.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm going to end up with one open and zero closes.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
This unbalanced open parenthesis is in the regular expression,

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
but not in the language of the grammar.

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
How about this balanced open followed by close?

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Well, that is in the language of P.

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I apply rule one and then rule two to get rid of the P. I fails our second clause.

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
How about this? Open close close? This is unbalanced.

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The scales would be tipped to the right. It's not in P. We're looking good so far.

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Is it in r? Yes. For this star, I'm going to repeat is once.

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
For this totally unrelated star, I'm going to repeat it twice.

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Both of these--open-open-close-close and open-open-open-close-close-close--

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
they're all in P, so they're disqualified because of clause 2.

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
In fact, all of the strings here are in the language of r.

24
00:01:26,000 --> 99:59:59,999
It's just that these three are also in the language of P.
