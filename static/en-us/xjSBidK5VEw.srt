00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:02,020
Alright, great work.

2
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:04,200
Let's do some coding questions.

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:05,950
Look at the code here.

4
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:08,420
One of these lines has an error on it.

5
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:12,570
Find the line with the error,
and write the line number here.

6
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:16,670
For example, if you think the error's on
this line right here, then you can read

7
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:21,660
the line number here, which is six,
and enter the number six here.

8
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:23,150
Hint, it's not on line six.
