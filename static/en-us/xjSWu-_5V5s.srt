1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:04,110
We're going to open up the Network tab in DevTools to start off.

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:06,570
The Network tab gives us a list of all the requests and

3
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:11,010
responses fired off by the browser in loading and rendering a Web page.

4
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:13,330
If we're recording as the Web page loads,

5
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:16,770
we'll see all sorts of resources that the website needs.

6
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:22,020
We see images, we see JavaScript files, and we even see some CSS.

7
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:26,440
In a moment, I'm going to stop and then start recording to get a fresh slate.

8
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:29,380
When we scroll down as far as we can, we'll hit a quick pause and

9
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:31,156
then all the sudden, new content will appear.

10
00:00:31,156 --> 00:00:34,280
In Network, we're going to see that request show up.

11
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:34,920
Let's go ahead and try it.

12
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:41,100
I will stop and start recording And scroll down.

13
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:41,720
There we go.

14
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:42,480
We could see it right there.

15
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,250
All right, let's see what we have in here.

16
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,280
We can see a request happen right here.

17
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:49,520
Let's click on it.

18
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,860
This request is called PagePostSectionPagelet.

19
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:56,880
And look, it's even got the word ajax inside the u, request URL.

20
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,240
At this point, I'm going to switch to some written instructions so

21
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,980
you can follow along with me.

22
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:04,060
I recommend opening up two browser windows side by side.

23
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:07,440
That way, you can follow along in Facebook in one window while you've got

24
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,280
the instructions from Udacity in the other.
