1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,330
So how do we use recycler view?

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:06,730
The first thing to note is that
almost every part of recycler view is

3
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:08,250
completely moduler.

4
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:11,529
The recycler view has an adapter
that is used to provide the recycler

5
00:00:11,529 --> 00:00:13,724
view with new views when needed.

6
00:00:13,724 --> 00:00:18,734
This Adapter is also used to bind data
from some Data Source to the views.

7
00:00:18,734 --> 00:00:22,035
The adapter sends the views to
a RecyclerView in an object

8
00:00:22,035 --> 00:00:23,475
called a ViewHolder.

9
00:00:23,475 --> 00:00:26,995
The ViewHolder contains a reference
to the root view object for the item.

10
00:00:26,995 --> 00:00:30,214
And you're expected to use it to
cache the view objects represented in

11
00:00:30,214 --> 00:00:33,810
the layout, to make it less costly
to update the views with new data.

12
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:36,910
This way,
find a view by ID gets called only for

13
00:00:36,909 --> 00:00:39,599
each data view whenever that
new item is created and

14
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,899
not each time you want to populate
the views in the item with data.

15
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:45,969
The Layout Manager then tells
the RecyclerView how to lay out

16
00:00:45,969 --> 00:00:47,280
all those views.

17
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,978
It could be a vertically scrolling
list like we use in SunShine, or

18
00:00:50,978 --> 00:00:54,759
horizontally scrolling lists, or
even a staggered list or a grid.

19
00:00:54,759 --> 00:00:58,969
You get some awesome animations for
item insertion and removal for free.

20
00:00:58,969 --> 00:01:01,420
Because it's based on a data source,
it's easy for

21
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:05,239
apps using Recycler View to allow for
filtering a list of items.

22
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:06,859
Android also has an older framework for

23
00:01:06,859 --> 00:01:09,209
displaying lists of
data called List View.

24
00:01:09,209 --> 00:01:12,629
It has mostly become outdated, thanks
to RecyclerView, for these reasons and

25
00:01:12,629 --> 00:01:13,390
several others.
