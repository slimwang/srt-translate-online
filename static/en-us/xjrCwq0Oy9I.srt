1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,490
To practice filtering queries by property you're going to add

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:06,090
a new function to the conference API class. You can

3
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:09,050
all the function whatever you like maybe something like Filter

4
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:12,550
Playground. The name doesn't matter because this function isn't going to

5
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:15,360
be called by the UI. You'll be using this function

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,770
to experiment with filters. You can think of it as a

7
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:21,807
playground method for exploring queries. This time you can leave

8
00:00:21,807 --> 00:00:25,240
off the @Api Method annotation. You don't have to but it's

9
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:27,710
a good chance to see what happens if you do.

10
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:30,450
The method will still be exposed as an endpoint function but

11
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:33,640
it'll use default values for the publish function name, the path

12
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:37,350
and the http method. Since we won't be using a form

13
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:39,710
to post values to this method we don't need to

14
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:42,990
set the http method to post. It'll work fine to use

15
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:47,670
the default http method. Define a function to create a query

16
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:50,380
to get all conferences where the city property has the value

17
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:54,490
London, sort the query results by conference name. Run

18
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:56,680
the app on the local host and use the API's

19
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:59,650
explorer to test it. Look for the new function name

20
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:03,080
in the list of functions. I called mine filter playground

21
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:08,170
and you see it shows up here as, conference.conferenceAPI.filterPlayground.

22
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:09,780
You won't be able to test your new function in

23
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:12,640
the conference central UI because nothing in the UI calls

24
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,570
your function. I want to emphasize again that you must

25
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:18,110
run the query first on local host, before you

26
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:21,320
deploy the App, Appspot and run the query there.

27
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,270
If you deploy it to Appspot first, you'll get

28
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:26,300
an error when you run the query. Let's execute it

29
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:32,780
and yes, I have some conferences in London. Obviously, you

30
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:35,600
need to make sure that you have some conferences in London

31
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,080
or else you won't get any results in this query.

32
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,820
After you got your query to work come back to the

33
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:43,450
code for your playground method and add another filter. This

34
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:47,410
time run a filter to check if the topic includes Medical

35
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:51,120
Innovations. Pay attention the fact that the topics property has a

36
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:55,820
plural, it's topics. And make sure you spell medical innovations right.

37
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:58,560
The topics property can have multiple values but you

38
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,750
can create a filter for topics just as you would

39
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:03,780
for property with a single value. The results will include

40
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:06,500
applicable conferences, whose topics include

41
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:09,110
the value, medical innovations. After

42
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:11,420
you've made the changes to your code run the app

43
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:13,485
on local host and try out the function in the

44
00:02:13,485 --> 00:02:16,200
API explorer. You'll need to make sure you have some

45
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:21,070
conferences in London and that the topics include medical innovations.

46
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:22,920
If you don't get any results check that you

47
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:26,280
really do have some conferences that meet all those criteria.

48
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,860
Oops, I don't, I'm going to have to go add another

49
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:32,530
conference. You just wait to create conferences is to use

50
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:35,530
the create conference page in the UI. So I added

51
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:39,810
another conference has very good name, chocolate for health and

52
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:43,450
the topics includes medical innovations, you see that its not

53
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:46,120
medical innovations is not the only topic, its just one

54
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:51,280
of the topics and the city is London. So my filters do work. So when you've

55
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:56,170
got your filters to work go ahead and check the box yes that they're working.
