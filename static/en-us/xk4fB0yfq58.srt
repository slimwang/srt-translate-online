00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
In this problem, we're given a new data structure that is a list of universities

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
where each entry is another list that contains the name of the university,

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
the number of students that attend that university, and the tuition costs.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
What we want to calculate are the total number of students enrolled at all universities in this list

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
and the amount of money that all of them are paying.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
What we're going to do is sum the number of students, so we're going to keep track

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
of all the students and keep adding for each university the second value on the list.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Then we're also going to keep a second counter

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
that is the amount of tuition that they're paying, and so what we're going to do for each entry

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
is we're going to multiply these two values and add those.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
We're going to have 50 times 2, which is 100, and 100 times 1, which is also 100.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,000
The end result would be the tuition is 200, and the number of students enrolled in 150.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
This is what we'll return--both those values.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Let's write the function that does that.

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I've declared the function. It takes in a list, and I've started my 2 sums--

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
the number of students enrolled and the total tuition all the students are paying.

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I've added a little trick here to make the code a little shorter.

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
This is a Python thing that you probably didn't know, but feel free to use it in the future.

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
What I'm saying is that for each value in the list, I have the name,

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
which is going to correspond to the first entry in the sublist,

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
the students correspond to the second entry in the sublist,

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
and price corresponds to the third entry in the sublist.

23
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
If I had the other version where I just say for i in p

24
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
and then assign the variables names, that's all we're doing here.

25
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:35,000
It's just a little short cut to save you this time of writing the 3 lines to write this out.

26
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Here for each school I update the number of students by simply

27
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
adding the number of students to the total count.

28
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I update the total tuition by simply adding

29
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
the amount the students are paying at this particular university to the total tuition.

30
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Then in the end I return both values, which you can do by simply adding the comma.
