00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,810
Let's do another quiz related to Amdahl's Law.

2
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:05,380
We still have our instruction types of integer,

3
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:08,398
branch, load, and store. Let's say now that

4
00:00:08,398 --> 00:00:12,006
the percentage of execution time we spent on each

5
00:00:12,006 --> 00:00:19,131
is 40% for integer, 20% on branches, 30% on loads, 10% on stores. And the CPI,

6
00:00:19,131 --> 00:00:21,770
we get for then is one for integer,

7
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:26,590
four branches, two for loads, and three for stores.

8
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:32,329
We have a processor that is clocked at two GHz. Let's say we are considering the

9
00:00:32,329 --> 00:00:36,418
possible improvements that are reducing the branch CPI

10
00:00:36,418 --> 00:00:40,037
from four to three. Increase the clock frequency

11
00:00:40,037 --> 00:00:46,120
of the processor from two GHz to two point three GHz. And reducing the store CPI

12
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:51,620
from three to two. Assuming we can only do one of these, which would you choose

13
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:53,010
according to the overall speed?
