00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:03,390
So now that you've written your first Python program, you might

2
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:06,850
be wondering why we need to invent new languages like Python to

3
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:09,530
program computers and spend all the effort into learning a new

4
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:13,380
language, rather than using some language like English or Mandarin that we

5
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:16,600
already know. And there lots of reasons for that. That natural

6
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,510
languages like English and Mandarin are great for people who grew up

7
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:22,770
speaking them for day-to-day conversation. But there are many reason that

8
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:26,300
they wouldn't work well for programming computers. The first one is ambiguity.

9
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:32,570
Natural languages are inherently ambiguous. Different people can interpret

10
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:35,210
the same sentence to mean many different things. When

11
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:38,220
we program computers, the computer needs to interpret that

12
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:40,400
program. And we want to make sure that the computer

13
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:43,300
interprets the program the exact same way that the

14
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:45,920
programmer, who wrote the program, intends for it to

15
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,790
be interpreted. So here's an example of the kinds

16
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:53,020
of ambiguities that come up in natural languages like English,

17
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:57,700
and we'll do this in the form of a quiz. So the question is, would you rather be

18
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:03,490
paid $100 weekly or biweekly? So these are the choices, you can

19
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:09,280
prefer to be paid $100 weekly; you can prefer to be paid $100 biweekly. It

20
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,570
depends, or you are an altruist and you don't like to be paid at all
