00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:01,980
Now that you know how
to make markers and

2
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:04,629
info windows, you can use what
you learned to make your own.

3
00:00:05,639 --> 00:00:09,599
Your goal is to create a map with
a marker, that when clicked,

4
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:12,419
displays an info window with
the coordinate of the marker.

5
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:18,629
Bonus points if you can get creative and
make some colored markers or animations.

6
00:00:18,629 --> 00:00:20,089
Just kidding, there are no points.

7
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:25,648
Using the starter code below, fill in
the TODOs with the correct information.

8
00:00:25,647 --> 00:00:30,509
Hint, use marker.position
to get the latlng.

00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:32,910
Look at the JavaScript
reference documentation and

10
00:00:32,909 --> 00:00:37,039
at the page listed below, to learn more
about the properties of each marker and

11
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:37,699
infowindow.

12
00:00:38,979 --> 00:00:41,715
Were you able to show a marker and
an infowindow?
