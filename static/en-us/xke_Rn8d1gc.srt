1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,740
The factor we're looking for is x minus 2, since we know that if we set this

2
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:08,979
equal to 0, that would lead us to x equaling 2. That means this is the factor

3
00:00:08,979 --> 00:00:12,268
we're going to need to divide this polynomial by.
