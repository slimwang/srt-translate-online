00:00:08,127 --> 00:00:12,620
devastating disease. Again for both people with Alzheimer's and their loved

00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:17,900
ones. Alzheimer's can effect people over the age of 60. It's a very rare to

00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:21,870
have an early onset Alzheimer's disease. And Alzheimer's disease results in

00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:25,860
progressive memory loss, and eventually complete memory loss.
