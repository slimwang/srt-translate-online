00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,190
Here are the answers. The first sentence is

2
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:05,740
true half the time and false half the time.

3
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:10,750
It would have been true all the time if we had written fire or not smoke, rather

4
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:12,790
than smoke or not fire on the right

5
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:17,950
hand side. The second sentence, is false when fire

6
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:20,520
is true and smoke is false and otherwise

7
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:25,460
true. The third sentence is always true. And this

8
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:29,010
is called the contrapositive. Smoke implies fire is

9
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:31,900
the same thing as not fire implies not

10
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:36,630
smoke. The fourth sentence is always true. And

11
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:38,700
you can figure that out by writing out the

12
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,630
full truth tables, or by reasoning about the

13
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:44,370
variable big. When big is true, the whole

14
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:46,470
sentence is true, because big is one of

15
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:50,550
the disjuncts. And when big is false, it's true,

16
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:57,330
because big implies dumb is true whenever the antecedent is false. And

17
00:00:57,330 --> 00:01:02,220
the final sentence is also always true. And this is known as De Morgan's Law.
