1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,564
So here is the real question, suppose you use

2
00:00:02,564 --> 00:00:04,509
this confidence interval to detect abnormal

3
00:00:04,509 --> 00:00:07,247
behavior and abnormal behavior mean, you go to

4
00:00:07,247 --> 00:00:09,238
your boss and you complain, heâ€™ll stop trading

5
00:00:09,238 --> 00:00:12,473
then how often during a day would you expect to

6
00:00:12,473 --> 00:00:15,868
detect abnormal behavior in your trading, or

7
00:00:15,868 --> 00:00:18,871
differently how frequently does this confidence

8
00:00:18,872 --> 00:00:21,388
internal trigger on any given single day.
