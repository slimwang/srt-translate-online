Thanks, Michael. Now, let's move on to our final sleep disorder that we're

2
00:00:03,078 --> 00:00:06,763
going to cover, insomnia. This is probably the most commonly known sleep

3
00:00:06,763 --> 00:00:12,004
disorder. This can result in people having difficulty falling asleep, staying

4
00:00:12,004 --> 00:00:16,934
asleep, or both. Either one of these or both of them results in a poor quality

5
00:00:16,934 --> 00:00:22,330
of sleep. And the individual will wake up tired and not well rested. We've

6
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:25,948
already learned about the physical and mental effects of sleep deprivation, so

7
00:00:25,948 --> 00:00:31,070
chronic insomnia may result in detrimental healthy consequences. Acute insomnia

8
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:35,480
can result from stressful events we experience, traumas or work and family

9
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:41,591
pressures. It can last from days to weeks. In addition to feeling less

10
00:00:41,591 --> 00:00:47,150
energetic, insomnia may cause one to feel irritable, anxious, even depressed.

11
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:50,566
This again makes a clear point that adequate sleep and quality of sleep is

12
00:00:50,566 --> 00:00:53,879
essential for our physical and mental health.
