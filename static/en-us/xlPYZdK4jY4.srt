00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:01,780
In order to solve this problem,

2
00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:06,220
first notice that we have two unknowns, z and z prime.

3
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:07,960
What does that indicate?

4
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:11,670
Well, we probably need two equations to solve.

5
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:15,390
One is our by now familiar thin lens equation.

6
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:19,940
That is 1 over z plus 1 over z prime equals 1 over f.

7
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:24,470
Let us simplify this so we can express one variable in terms of the other.

8
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:28,400
Adding the two terms on the left hand side, and then cross multiplying.

9
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:33,720
Now say we want all the zs on one side, take z common, and

10
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:39,810
finally we can write zs, z prime f over z prime minus f.

11
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:41,920
Remember this last result.

12
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,900
Now, we need to think about a second equation.

13
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:46,310
Look at the diagram again.

14
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:47,260
See anything useful?

15
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:49,960
How about these two similar triangles.

16
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:57,610
They tell us that half of d over z prime is equal to half of w over z.

17
00:00:57,610 --> 00:01:03,480
Simplifying this, we can write that is z equals w over d times z prime.

18
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:09,310
This is our second result, remember we found earlier that z equals z prime

19
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:16,520
f over z prime minus f, and now we saw that z equals, w over d times z prime.

20
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:26,260
Equating these two and solving further, we have z prime equals d f by w plus f.

21
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:27,940
Now putting the value of d, f,

22
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:33,330
and w here, you should get z prime equals 52.5 millimeters,

23
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:37,920
putting that here, should give you z equals one point o five1.05 meters
