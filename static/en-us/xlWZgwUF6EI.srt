1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:04,240
So we can measure performance as either latency or throughput.

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:06,880
Let's see now, how do we compare performance of two

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:09,510
different systems. So we want to be able to say

4
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:14,010
something like system X is N times faster than system

5
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:17,540
Y. And the way we usually refer to this statement

6
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:20,020
is that the speedup of X over Y is equal

7
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:25,640
to N. So we compute N as the speed of X divided by speed of Y, and now it starts

8
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:28,280
to matter whether we have latency as our

9
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:32,142
measure of speed or throughput. For throughput N

10
00:00:32,142 --> 00:00:35,310
can be computed simply as the throughput of

11
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:38,038
X divided by throughput of Y, but for

12
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:41,206
latency, speed of X is not proportional to

13
00:00:41,206 --> 00:00:44,800
the latency effects. The longer the latency, the

14
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:50,700
lower the speed. So what we do instead, is we divide the latency of Y by the

15
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:54,220
latency of X to get the speedup of X over Y.
