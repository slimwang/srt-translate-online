1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:04,180
So we want to talk about something
called a Time to Check versus a Time to

2
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:05,660
Use problem.

3
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:07,740
Time to Check is when you open the file.

4
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:10,300
Time to Use is when you either read or
write it.

5
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:12,950
So a time to check,
time to use vulnerability

6
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:19,480
arises because access check is
performed separately from use.

7
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:22,260
Typically when you say you want to use
a resource, you perform the check.

8
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:27,230
But the model that I just showed you
with the open call coming first and

9
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:29,900
then read writes happening later on, and

10
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:33,870
you can do as long as the file is in
the closed and the process is running.

11
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:36,760
Okay, so it could be a while
before you do your read or

12
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:38,430
write after the open was done.

13
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:42,270
So when the two are separated,
this vulnerability arises.

14
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:47,990
And based on what time to check versus
time to use, think about what these are.

15
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:51,760
I want you to look into these
two options that we have.

16
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,320
What is the reason for this TOCTOU
vulnerability that we're talking about?
