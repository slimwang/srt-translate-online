1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:01,546
JP, how's Hawaii?

2
00:00:01,546 --> 00:00:02,532
>> What?

3
00:00:02,532 --> 00:00:04,920
I could hardly hear you over
the sounds of the jungle.

4
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:06,740
Let me go over to that tree.

5
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:09,330
>> Okay, J.P.
>> That's better.

6
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:09,840
So how are you and

7
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,740
the developer doing besides all
the craziness with launching 0.5?

8
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,310
>> Pretty good.

9
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:18,360
I submitted Shopping List Plus Plus
to the Abbie's like you suggested.

10
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:21,540
We're a bit of a long shot what with
Grocery Grabber having just released

11
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:23,990
their next version, but you never know.

12
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:25,460
>> That's awesome.

13
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:29,060
>> And let's see, besides that, well we
finished everything on the wire frames.

14
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:29,900
>> Woo hoo.

15
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:31,360
That's great to hear.

16
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:34,410
Why don't you take me through everything
you guys have done for old times sake?

17
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:35,880
>> Sure thing.

18
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:39,520
Shopping List Plus Plus is turning
into a fully fledged experience, and

19
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,150
it's all thanks to you, the developer.

20
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:47,850
Starting with version 0.1, you made a
very basic prototype that just read and

21
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:48,455
wrote some data.

22
00:00:48,455 --> 00:00:54,000
In version 0.2, you flush this out
more by incorporating FirebaseUI so

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,798
that you could list out shopping
lists and shopping list items.

24
00:00:56,798 --> 00:01:02,520
In version 0.3, you added user
accounts as well as a bunch of

25
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:06,050
functionality like letting others know
that you're in the store shopping and

26
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:07,412
marking that you've bought items.

27
00:01:07,412 --> 00:01:12,610
Version 0.4 might have been
our most triumph moment

28
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:15,816
when you overhaul the data structure
to allow for shopping list sharing.

29
00:01:15,816 --> 00:01:19,377
You also added some pretty
snazzy sorting features.

30
00:01:19,377 --> 00:01:24,640
In version 0.5,
you added offline functionality so

31
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,540
that the app caches data even
when it's not on the screen.

32
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,780
Also implemented a bunch of read,
write and

33
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:35,490
validation rules to make sure that
our data is properly formed and

34
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:37,815
that only the correct
people have access to it.

35
00:01:37,815 --> 00:01:43,250
>> Nice, so I gotta ask, what about
that big security flaw you talked about?

36
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:44,490
>> Well, for the short term,

37
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:48,260
I basically got another engineer to
separate our password and email flow.

38
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:51,280
But we'll be looking into
incorporating a simplistic server,

39
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,050
maybe the later version.

40
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:55,423
Hey, Gregory and Walter are here,
and they want to say hi.

41
00:01:55,423 --> 00:01:56,552
>> Dujippi!

42
00:01:56,552 --> 00:01:58,265
My friend.

43
00:01:58,265 --> 00:01:59,800
>> Hey.

44
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,730
>> Hey guys, great to see all of you.

45
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:03,430
Actually, I might need to sign off.

46
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:06,280
I don't like the way that
parakeet is looking at me.

47
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:08,341
>> Okay, bye.

48
00:02:08,341 --> 00:02:09,014
>> Bye.

49
00:02:09,014 --> 00:02:09,862
>> Bye.

50
00:02:09,862 --> 00:02:11,476
>> Have fun.

51
00:02:11,476 --> 00:02:15,710
Well, that was an informative blast
from the somewhat recent past.

52
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:17,660
Man, I can't believe that
just three months ago,

53
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:20,090
I was sitting at a meeting with
the Bay Area Shoppers Group.

54
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:22,650
>> You've come a long way, and
you've come a long way too.

55
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:24,930
You now know how to read
data into Firebase.

56
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:26,580
>> You also know how
to take that data and

57
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:29,020
display it in real
time in a Firebase app.

58
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:30,320
>> Let's not forget users.

59
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,680
You also know how to create
authentication methods for

60
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:35,250
email and
another provider such as Google.

61
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:38,440
>> And you've learned how to create
firebase data schemas to avoid things

62
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:41,370
like nesting data while also
denormalizing your data.

63
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:43,920
This really helps you grow and
scale your apps.

64
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,910
>> You've also learned how to filter and
sort your data.

65
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:48,975
>> Finally, we learned how to use
Firebase's security rules language to

66
00:02:48,975 --> 00:02:50,630
make our apps status secure.

67
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:52,380
>> That's a lot.
>> That is a lot.

68
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:54,540
You know what?

69
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:56,390
I feel like you deserve
this API as much as I do.

70
00:02:56,390 --> 00:03:02,310
>> Yeah but more than a cell phone
duct taped to a cheap trophy,

71
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:05,130
we hope you feel empowered to
create your own apps in Firebase.

72
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:06,160
>> Actually that reminds me,

73
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:09,000
I have another venture that I
wanted to talk to you about.

74
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,020
And I can actually send
over the spec right

75
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:17,080
after we all take a well deserved rest,
so yeah, let's go ahead and do that.

76
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,405
Speaking of which, Holder's taking
forever with that Instarito.

77
00:03:21,405 --> 00:03:22,891
>> Yeah, where is he?

78
00:03:22,891 --> 00:03:24,132
Where is he?

79
00:03:24,132 --> 00:03:25,584
Where is he?

80
00:03:25,584 --> 00:03:26,826
Where is he?

81
00:03:26,826 --> 00:03:28,185
Where is he?

82
00:03:28,185 --> 00:03:29,566
Where is he?

83
00:03:29,566 --> 00:03:30,971
Where is he?

84
00:03:30,971 --> 00:03:33,099
Where is he?
