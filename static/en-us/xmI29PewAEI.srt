00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:02,390
The specific objectives, this lesson are for

2
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:05,590
you to learn about, the benefits of feature detection and

3
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:09,650
matching in two images, again, given two images I want to be able to find,

4
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:13,220
commonalities in these two images for a variety of applications.

5
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:16,570
I'm also going to discuss, what makes a good feature.

6
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:20,360
An example of a good feature in this context would be a corner,

7
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:23,460
some sort of an information that defines a corner in an image that would

8
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:26,860
allow us to find a repeatable match across multiple images.

9
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:30,770
And we'll also talk about briefly the Harris Corner Detector Algorithm, and I

10
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:34,970
will just introduce the basic concept of a SIFT detector, both the Harris Corner

11
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:37,770
and SIFT detector we'll discuss in detail, in a future lecture.
