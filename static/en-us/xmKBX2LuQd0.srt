00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:06,175
We just saw that the expression 6x squared minus 7x minus 5 factors to 2x plus

2
00:00:06,175 --> 00:00:11,591
1 times 3x minus 5. Now, check out the colors that I've used here for the

3
00:00:11,591 --> 00:00:15,540
different terms. And notice how the terms that are the same colors in the top

4
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:19,846
expression and the one below it are related. The negative 5 here, comes

5
00:00:19,846 --> 00:00:24,578
straight from the positive 1 and the negative 5. And the 6 here, comes from the

6
00:00:24,578 --> 00:00:31,128
2 and 3. 2 and 3 are factors of 6 and -5 and 1 are both factors of -5. Now, can

7
00:00:31,128 --> 00:00:36,282
you tell me based on our factorization, what are the zeros of this function? As

00:00:36,282 --> 00:00:39,673
always, please separate your answers in this box by commas.
