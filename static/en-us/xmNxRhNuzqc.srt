00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:07,994
ourselves what properties do we want all entities to support? Does an entity

00:00:07,994 --> 00:00:12,310

00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:16,994

00:00:16,994 --> 00:00:22,460
post to your Google Plus Stream? Please check all that apply for all entities.

00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:25,764
Note, we're not just talking about one entity, we're talking about all

00:00:25,764 --> 00:00:26,940
entities.
