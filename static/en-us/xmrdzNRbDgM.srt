00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:03,710
Phew, some of that was pretty technical, but if you

2
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:06,215
followed along, you now have a solid understanding of the

3
00:00:06,215 --> 00:00:09,280
semantics of threaded programming. You are now familiar with the

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:13,370
notions of joinable and detached threads, locks, synchronization, and many

5
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:16,410
of the details of the p threads library. Of course,

6
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:18,100
you will learn much more if you get involved in

7
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:21,230
developing an application that uses threaded programming, but now at

8
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:24,130
least you have a good foundation to start from. Happy programming.
