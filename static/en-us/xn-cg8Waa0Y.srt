1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,101
Now let's try something a little bit harder. Try multiplying these two binomials

2
00:00:04,101 --> 00:00:07,880
together. Notice that we have a variable in the first term and in the second

3
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:11,797
term, in both binomials. Our process for multiplying works the same way, you

4
00:00:11,797 --> 00:00:15,798
want to be careful with your exponents and combine like terms. You can put your

5
00:00:15,798 --> 00:00:17,045
answer here, good luck.
