00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:02,660
This one's going to
be a two-parter quiz.

2
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:05,480
For this first part, you need to
create the website for a bakery and

3
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:07,520
fill it with some static content.

4
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:09,860
The website will need routes for
the store and then routes for

5
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:13,650
some of the things it sells,
such as cakes, cupcakes, and cookies.

6
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:16,350
Once you've generated all these routes,
add an additional link for

7
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:18,640
the store's home page here.

8
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,700
Each route will need a heading so make
sure you review these instructions for

9
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:24,580
exactly what to put as the heading for
each page.

10
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:27,600
You're going to fill out the cookie
page with some actual content.

11
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:28,700
I've created this table for

12
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:31,355
you with some data that you'll
need to use on that page.

13
00:00:31,355 --> 00:00:33,505
Let me give you a quick preview
of what I came up with for

14
00:00:33,505 --> 00:00:35,495
this first part of the quiz.

15
00:00:35,495 --> 00:00:39,335
I have a store route now,
the store has links to its baked goods.

16
00:00:39,335 --> 00:00:41,155
All of these are nested routes.

17
00:00:41,155 --> 00:00:43,545
Clicking on the cookie link displays
all of the information from

18
00:00:43,545 --> 00:00:45,005
the instructions.

19
00:00:45,005 --> 00:00:47,895
As you can probably tell I'm
a world class designer, so

20
00:00:47,895 --> 00:00:51,135
I hope you can make your website
look at least half as good as this.

21
00:00:51,135 --> 00:00:53,580
Actually I highly doubt you could
make it look any worse than this.

22
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:55,940
But the goal is more practice
with generating routes,

23
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:58,790
working with nested routes and
creating templates.

24
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:01,750
The link to the starter code for
this project is in the instructor notes.

25
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:03,050
When you finish building the template,

26
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:04,910
the feedback extension
will give you a code.

27
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:07,610
Enter that code on the next page,
good luck.

28
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:09,980
Ember uses the queue
unit testing framework.

29
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:12,920
And I created a number of tests
that you need to satisfy.

30
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,760
These tests help guide you through
completing the assignment.

31
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:19,230
Once all the tests have passed the
feedback extension will give you a code.

32
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:20,990
Enter that code on the next page.

33
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:23,960
You can find a link to this project's
test page in the project's read me file.
