00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,270
There's a number of reasons
you'd be potentially better off

2
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:07,138
breaking your app into different activities.
Having a single monolithic activity

3
00:00:07,173 --> 00:00:09,760
increases the complexity of your code,

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,370
making the creation
and management of intent filters

5
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:15,470
much harder and making it
more difficult to maintain, test,

6
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:18,740
and read your activity code.
It also increases the risk

7
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:23,443
of tightly coupling independent components
and makes it much more likely

8
00:00:23,443 --> 00:00:26,395
to introduce security risks
if the single activity includes

9
00:00:26,395 --> 00:00:29,721
both sensitive information
and information that's safe to share.

10
00:00:29,721 --> 00:00:32,371
A good rule of thumb
is to create a new activity

11
00:00:32,435 --> 00:00:35,260
whenever the context changes.
For example, displaying

12
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:38,958
a different kind of data, while switching
from viewing to entering data.
