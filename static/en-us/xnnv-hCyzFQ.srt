00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,857
We just simplified 4 plus 5 i, over 2 minus 3 i, to be written instead as

2
00:00:04,857 --> 00:00:09,963
negative 7 plus 22 i over 13. This is clearly a complex number, but it's not

3
00:00:09,963 --> 00:00:15,434
written in the form that we usually see complex numbers written in. So the last

4
00:00:15,434 --> 00:00:21,196
step, in modifying this initial complex number, I'd like you to write our answer

5
00:00:21,196 --> 00:00:25,974
in the form a plus bi. So put the real part of the number here and the imaginary

6
00:00:25,974 --> 00:00:30,372
component here. In fact I'll even write in the i for you. So you just need to

7
00:00:30,372 --> 00:00:32,061
tell me what a and b are here.
