1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,700
We talked already about some
of the differences between

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:06,970
Exchange Traded Funds,
Mutual Funds, and Hedge Funds.

3
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:10,090
And those differences that we talked
about are primarily having to do with

4
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:16,059
how they're traded and how visible, what
their holding is to those who invest.

5
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:19,700
Another very,
very important sort of difference is

6
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:24,120
how are the managers of
these funds compensated?

7
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:26,830
In other words,
there's some sort of rule for

8
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:32,320
each one that shows how
the fund managers make money.

9
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:37,740
And that's very, very important because
the manner in which they're paid

10
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:42,220
incentivizes them to trade or
act in certain ways.

11
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:44,720
So let's talk about each
one of these individually.

12
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:48,830
Before I get started, though,
I have to introduce one concept here.

13
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:53,554
It's called assets under management or
AUM.

14
00:00:53,554 --> 00:00:58,416
And this is the buzz word that simply
means how much money is being managed by

15
00:00:58,416 --> 00:00:59,950
the fund?

16
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:01,810
It's important because for

17
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:07,540
all of these part of the compensation
is a percentage of the AUM.

18
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:12,700
The managers of ETFs are compensated
according to an expense ratio

19
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:16,850
which is simply some percentage of AUM.

20
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:21,000
Expenditure issues for
ETFs are usually pretty low.

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,200
They vary from as low .01% or,

22
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:29,080
one bit as that might be called,
to as high as 1%.

23
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:35,740
But one that's up to 1% is
fairly high and pretty unusual.

24
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:41,450
Mutual fund managers are also
compensated using an expense ratio.

25
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:43,840
These are somewhat higher than ETFs.

26
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,409
They range from a low of,
typically, about 0.5%,

27
00:01:48,409 --> 00:01:52,046
to some that are very high, up to 3%.

28
00:01:52,046 --> 00:01:55,540
Now, what's the reason for
this difference?

29
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:57,780
Well, mutual fund managers
will tell you that

30
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:03,320
the way they manage funds
requires much more skill.

31
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:07,350
They have much more discretion
than those who are managing ETFs.

32
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:10,788
ETFs usually are tied to an index.

33
00:02:10,788 --> 00:02:18,650
As an example, a popular ETF, SPY,
is supposed to track the S&P 500.

34
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:22,880
And, all that an ETF manager
has to do in that case

35
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:27,390
is just make sure that they are holding
all the stocks and the S&P 500.

36
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:32,340
Mutual funds, on the other hand,
supposedly use more skill and therefore,

37
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:35,540
they can charge a higher expense ratio

38
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:41,380
both were the cost of research and
also for their skill.

39
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:45,020
Finally Hedge funds
are completely different breed

40
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:48,080
in terms of how their
manager's are compensated.

41
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,515
You follow the old model called two and
twenty which means 2 or

42
00:02:52,515 --> 00:02:59,270
2% of AUM, plus 20% of the profits.

43
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:05,630
So as you can see, it's higher
than both of these other methods.

44
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:10,981
And most importantly, it includes this
component relating to profits, that 20%.

45
00:03:10,981 --> 00:03:14,490
Now, one or
two other things to clarify here.

46
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:19,280
What I've been talking about is
the way that the folks who manage

47
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,530
these funds are compensated.

48
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:25,580
Separately, if you are an investor in
one of these funds, in other words you

49
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:30,990
give your money to one of these
types of funds to be managed,

50
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:37,180
your return is based on how much
the value of that fund increased and

51
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:42,340
in most cases that increase is subject
to what happens to the economy or

52
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:44,560
what happens in the markets.

53
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,860
Let's look at a more detailed example
of this two and twenty structure.
