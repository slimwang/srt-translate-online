1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,990
So from the introduction that I gave you

2
00:00:01,990 --> 00:00:05,110
about Quicksilver you can see that it has identified

3
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:08,061
many problems that you and I face with

4
00:00:08,061 --> 00:00:12,050
our everyday computing. With orphaned windows and, and memory

5
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:17,320
leaks and so on. So the question to you is, name the company and the year that

6
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:19,840
Quicksilver was built. And the choices I'm giving

7
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:24,540
you in terms of companies include IBM, Sun, HP,

8
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:28,610
Apple, Microsoft, and Google. And the choice of years I'm giving

9
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:34,870
you is, the early part of 80s, early part of 90s,

10
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:38,110
early part of 2000s, or 2013. So pick your choice for

11
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:42,160
the company and the year in which Quicksilver system was built.
