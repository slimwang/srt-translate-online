00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:04,790
Price elasticity of demand is
a measure used in economics to show

2
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:09,380
the responsiveness, or elasticity,
of the quantity demanded of a good or

3
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:11,100
service to the change in its price.

4
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:16,320
We can use A/B testing to analyze
whether a change in price

5
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,610
impacts the quantity of a good or
service as a result.

6
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:24,900
Remember, A/B testing analyzes whether a
change applied to an experimental group,

7
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,880
is statistically different
from a control group.

8
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:31,830
Measuring the impact of a change,
before applying it broadly,

9
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:36,020
could be useful in minimizing the
potential negative impact of a change.

10
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:39,230
For instance, if you're thinking
of running a promotion,

11
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:41,500
you would run a test
on a subset of stores,

12
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:45,390
to determine if a promotion had
a positive impact on profit.

13
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:47,420
If the test showed positive results,

14
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:49,690
you would roll out the changes
to the rest of your stores.

15
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:53,330
Let's work through a detailed problem.

16
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:56,300
Imagine that you work for
a chain of spas.

17
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:59,820
You're part of a team looking for
ways to increase the gross margin, and

18
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:02,370
you've decide to experiment
with the price of facials.

19
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:07,450
Currently, your stores offer facials for
98.99, and you'd

20
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:10,670
like to predict whether a change in
price would yield greater gross margin.

21
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:14,870
You've been asked to predict
the gross margin change

22
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:18,830
if the facials were at 87.99 or 76.99.

23
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:24,300
We need to creat an A/B test that will
help us predict the gross margin change,

24
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:27,970
with different prices of facials,
assuming that the average customer

25
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:30,540
visits a store about
once every ten weeks.

26
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:34,880
Remember the process for A/B testing?

27
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,150
First, we'll select the treatment and
control units.

28
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:40,680
Then, we'll prepare and run the test.

29
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,760
And lastly, we'll analyse the results.
