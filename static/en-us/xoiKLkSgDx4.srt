00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
In this question I'd like you to fit a Markov model.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
We have 3 sequences of observation--A, B, C, A, B, C.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
This is the first state--state0--and these are the other states.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Same for A, A, B, B, C, C and A, A, A, C, C, C.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
These are 3 different observation sequences.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
The first element here is state0.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
All the other ones are examples of transitions from state to xt-1 to xt.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Using maximum likelihood, I'd like to know the initial properties for state0

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
and all the transition probabilities. Those are indicated by the arrow.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
This is the probability that A at time t - 1 goes to A at time t.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Here they are.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
For any of the symbols in the sequence, we see there are three possible outcomes--

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
A-B-C, A-B-C, and A-B-C.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Each has a probability. Obviously, these 3 over here have to add up to 1.

15
00:01:01,000 --> 99:59:59,999
These 3 over here have to add up to 1, and these 3 over here have to add up to 1.
