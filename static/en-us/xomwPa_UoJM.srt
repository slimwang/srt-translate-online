1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:02,220
So why don't you tell me about your first, first solution.

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:03,570
What components do you have?

3
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:09,330
>> Sure. So I started with five components, and then I added one towards

4
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:12,280
the end because I realized I might need a distinction for this component.

5
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:15,460
So I have a line, and lines consist of words.

6
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:17,170
So there's two components I have.

7
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:22,180
And, and in- >> So, so you have a component that holds the data for lines?

8
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:24,370
>> Yes. >> And a component that holds the data for words?

9
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:25,140
>> Yes. >> Okay.

10
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:26,360
Go ahead.

11
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:32,130
That have index, which is this object that holds all of our titles,

12
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:33,370
which consist of lines and nodes.

13
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:41,030
I guess, actually, I don't, I think titles may not be necessary.

14
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:42,540
I feel like I'm saying the same thing.

15
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:46,080
The index consists of all of our lines.

16
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:50,430
>> So the index, the word index could either be a verb or a noun.

17
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:52,850
So this is, this, you're thinking of it as a data structure?

18
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:53,710
>> Yes.

19
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:54,210
>> Go ahead.

20
00:00:55,250 --> 00:01:00,234
>> And then I have a, a system which contains this index of all of our lines,

21
00:01:00,234 --> 00:01:05,138
and then it also contains, or also uses our passes control to a circle or

22
00:01:05,138 --> 00:01:08,720
like a shifter that will shift those lines around.

23
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,920
>> Okay, well, which of the components is responsible for doing the sorting?

24
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:16,700
>> Okay, so I've worked that out.

25
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:17,240
I don't have one.

26
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,435
>> Okay, so one other one.

27
00:01:18,435 --> 00:01:19,020
>> Mm-hm.

28
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:21,610
>> And so, the, the operation here would be the system

29
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:27,070
passing over control to the, well, tell, tell me how it would work?

30
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:29,040
What would be the, the steps?

31
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,398
>> So the system would pass control to the index, or

32
00:01:33,398 --> 00:01:39,669
it would use the index to aggregate through all of our lines,

33
00:01:39,669 --> 00:01:45,434
all of our, yes, all of our lines that had multiple words in it.

34
00:01:45,434 --> 00:01:50,003
And as it's going through each line circler would then circle it in all

35
00:01:50,003 --> 00:01:55,740
the different formations that the line could be in so that the index will grow.

36
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:01,140
>> So the, the system is doing the calling into the data structure index to

37
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:05,510
get a, get out particular pieces, it then passes those to the circular shifter?

38
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:07,140
>> Yes.

39
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:11,050
>> Okay. And then a circular shifter produces some results that are then

40
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:13,240
passed over to the sorter.

41
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:13,900
Okay.

42
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:17,811
And this order does its thing and presumably there's an input process at

43
00:02:17,811 --> 00:02:21,195
the start of this and there's an output process at the end of this.

44
00:02:21,195 --> 00:02:21,883
>> Yes.

45
00:02:21,883 --> 00:02:24,405
Well the way you phrased one part,

46
00:02:24,405 --> 00:02:29,016
the circler doesn't necessarily have to know about this order.

47
00:02:29,016 --> 00:02:33,480
So the circler its, I'm thinking its only job is rearrange the lines and

48
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:36,900
then now you have this index all the different arrangements in your lines.

49
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,940
That index could then just work with the sorter and

50
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,749
the circler doesn't have to know about it.

51
00:02:40,749 --> 00:02:41,514
>> Sure.

52
00:02:41,514 --> 00:02:49,050
And now, what is it that breaks the file into lines and the lines into words?

53
00:02:50,906 --> 00:02:54,950
>> I guess the, the system in this case would be the one that gets the file and

54
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:59,320
then gives that off to the index or populates the index initially.
