1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:04,928
2 is the correct solution set. Fantastic work if you figured that one out. We

2
00:00:04,928 --> 00:00:09,028
want to start out by finding the LCD for these three fractions. Since this is a

3
00:00:09,028 --> 00:00:14,558
quadratic trinomial, we should factor it first to determine the LCD. This

4
00:00:14,558 --> 00:00:19,882
denominator factors to x minus 3 times x minus 4. Since we have an equation, we

5
00:00:19,882 --> 00:00:24,620
can multiply each term by the same factor. This keeps our equation balanced.

6
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:31,739
When we multiply through by the LCD, we'll get 1 times x minus 4, minus 4 times

7
00:00:31,739 --> 00:00:37,950
x minus 3, which equals x. We distribute the negative 4 to get negative 4 x and

8
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:43,000
positive 12. Next we combine all like terms to get negative 3 x plus 8 equals x.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,410
To solve this part we want to get our variables on one side of the equation and

10
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:52,364
our constants on the other. This is why we add positive 3 x to each side. And

11
00:00:52,364 --> 00:00:58,702
finally dividing both sides by 4 we'll get x is equal to 2. Our solution set. We

12
00:00:58,702 --> 00:01:03,706
know x cannot equal positive 3 and x cannot equal positive 4. These are excluded

13
00:01:03,706 --> 00:01:08,400
values. We check our solution set against these to be sure this is correct.

14
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,653
Otherwise it, we would have no solution.
