1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,130
The answer actually is false.

2
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:03,890
The statement is false.

3
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:08,820
It's true that it can be read by
anyone because of the redound rule,

4
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:11,510
but it cannot be written by anyone,
okay?

5
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:13,290
So this is not correct.

6
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:14,750
Okay.
This part is wrong.

7
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:16,650
So it can be read or written by anyone.

8
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:18,110
That's, that's not true.

9
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:19,830
It can only be read by anyone.

10
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:22,860
So read is yes, true, anyone.

11
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:26,620
So to write,
it can only be unclassified.

12
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:28,260
Okay.
No one at the higher level

13
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:31,830
is ever to write into a document because
if they can write into this document

14
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:35,620
then the information can flow from
a more sensitive level to this level.
