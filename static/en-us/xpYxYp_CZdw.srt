1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:01,589
Gee, nest egg!

2
00:00:03,534 --> 00:00:04,402
My goodness.

3
00:00:04,402 --> 00:00:05,993
Thank God.

4
00:00:05,993 --> 00:00:08,348
It was only a dream,
it was only a dream.

5
00:00:08,348 --> 00:00:10,194
A dream of the future.

6
00:00:14,467 --> 00:00:18,345
Make sure to keep data denormalized.

7
00:00:25,845 --> 00:00:28,747
What will happen to ShoppingList++
with denormalized data?

8
00:00:28,747 --> 00:00:31,708
What will happen to ShoppingList++
with denormalized data?

9
00:00:31,708 --> 00:00:34,529
What will happen to [INAUDIBLE]?

10
00:00:34,529 --> 00:00:37,604
[MUSIC]

11
00:00:37,604 --> 00:00:42,380
Walter, do you have any idea when
they're going to turn the heat back on?

12
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:44,920
I'm just not sure how else
we're going to brave this harsh

13
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,230
San Francisco summer.

14
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:47,820
>> No heat if we can't pay the bills.

15
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:50,750
I guess we'll have to keep
burning these ShoppingList++

16
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:52,080
promotional posters for warmth.

17
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:57,480
Man, I really wish that we
could call JP right now.

18
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,860
>> Did someone say my name?

19
00:00:58,860 --> 00:00:59,490
>> My gosh.

20
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:01,080
JP, where do you come from?

21
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:03,060
>> Well,
I've been living in your crawl space.

22
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:07,350
Like Walter, I invested everything
in ShoppingList++ during its heyday.

23
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:09,970
Although you had that pesky
technical issue about many-to-many

24
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:12,810
relationships and
didn't have any users yet,

25
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:16,135
I was sure it was going to be
a viable product, so here I am.

26
00:01:16,135 --> 00:01:18,950
>> Hey,
since we've got nothing better to do,

27
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:22,070
why don't you tell us a little bit
more about that technical issue?

28
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:28,709
You can use the last of my worldly
possessions to help, my tablet.
