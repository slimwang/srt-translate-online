My answer is it seems very complex for
a patient to deal with.

00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:08,240
There are over 80 categories of
information, and some of their names,

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,330
for example blood oxygen saturation,

4
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:14,640
may not be clear to someone
without a medical background.

5
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:18,610
It seems to validate the idea
that patients should be

6
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:22,680
able to just pick a condition they
have to share all related information.
