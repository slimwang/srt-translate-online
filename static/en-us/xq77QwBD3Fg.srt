00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,760
Welcome to 2D game
development with Lib GDX.

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:05,220
Before we do anything else,

3
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:07,790
I want to show you the game
you'll make in this course.

4
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:09,430
It's called Icicles.

5
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:11,560
We can select a difficulty, and

6
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:14,710
then we use the arrow keys
to dodge the fallen icicles.

7
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:18,580
We keep track of our score as the number
of icicles that we've dodged And

8
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:21,670
when an icicle hits us, the game resets.

9
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:25,150
Even better, once you've made
this game it'll run anywhere.

10
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:28,410
From your desktop computer to
web browsers to your phone,

11
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:30,840
either Android or iOS.

12
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:34,200
So want to make awesome 2-D
games that run anywhere?

13
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:34,960
Let's get started.
