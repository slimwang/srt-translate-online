Okay. I want to add one more piece to our URL's. And

2
00:00:03,124 --> 00:00:06,310
that's called a fragment. A fragment is separated from the rest of

3
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:10,290
the URL by a hash sign. A fragment is generally used

4
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:13,330
to reference a particular part of the page you are looking at.

5
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:16,650
There are other fancier uses if you're, if you're going to do

6
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:21,430
some complex JavaScript things. But for our purposes, it's just there. And

7
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:23,080
all I really want you to know is that when you

8
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:25,710
see it in the URL, it is not sent to the server

9
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:28,270
when you make a request. The fragment purely exists in

10
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:31,953
the browser. If we had a URL with both queries and

11
00:00:31,953 --> 00:00:35,410
a fragment, I'll show you how that looks. When there are

12
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:39,210
query parameters, the fragment follows the query parameters. It comes last.
