1
00:00:01,359 --> 00:00:05,050
The reality of mobile networking
means that the number of

2
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:09,620
file requests can be just as
significant as the size of requests.

3
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:13,300
In other words, aim to reduce
the number of image requests,

4
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:16,180
not just the size of image files.

5
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:19,740
>> We call this problem latency,
which is the delay between request and

6
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:20,740
response.

7
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:22,370
>> Yeah.
Every time your browser attempts to

8
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:25,870
retrieve an image from a website
there are potential delays

9
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:30,510
at every step of the way between your
device and the website's servers.

10
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:34,910
And every one of those delays can
vary significantly and unpredictably.

11
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:37,530
>> Behind all that is
the fundamental problem that data

12
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:40,420
can't travel any faster
than the speed of light.

13
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:43,670
>> Yeah, I mean surely Google or someone
else could do something about that.

14
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:46,290
The speed of light, you know,
it's so last century.

15
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:47,490
Cameron, like,
you're a physicist, right.

16
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:48,840
>> Stop, stop, stop, stop.

17
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:49,550
No.
>> All right.

18
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:50,190
>> Definitely not.

19
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:51,810
At least, not any time this millennium.

20
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:53,230
>> All right, whatever, whatever.

21
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:58,950
Anyway, optical fiber can only achieve a
bit better than half the speed of light.

22
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:02,870
So, at best, London to California,
return trip times for

23
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:05,269
example, are around
a hundred milliseconds.

24
00:01:05,269 --> 00:01:06,830
>> And performance expert,

25
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:10,440
Ilya Grigorik,
calls latency the new bottleneck.

26
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:11,130
>> Thanks Sam.

27
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:12,370
Indeed, it turns out that for

28
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:16,290
many modern web pages, bandwidth
doesn't matter as much as latency does.

29
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:18,760
If you find that surprising,
check the instructor notes for

30
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:21,110
an explanation of why that is the case.

31
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:24,160
The bottom line is that performance
is a fundamental part of a truly

32
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,610
responsive design.

33
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:28,600
In practice, that means you need
to reduce the file sizes and

34
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,410
reduce the number of file requests.

35
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:34,260
And one great way to reduce the number
of image bytes is to compress them or

36
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:35,320
reduce the number of images.

37
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,150
>> Thanks Eliott.

38
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:37,780
In this lesson,

39
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:42,100
we show you lots of ways to achieve
graphical effects without image files.
