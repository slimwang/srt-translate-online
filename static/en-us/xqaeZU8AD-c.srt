1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:03,890
We've posed the general problem of
supervised regression learning and

2
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:07,090
introduced two algorithms
that can solve it.

3
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:10,110
Linear regression creates
parametrize models and

4
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:14,200
K and N is a non-parametric
instance base method.

5
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:17,770
There are in fact many algorithms
that can solve this problem.

6
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:20,760
Each algorithm has it's on pros and
cons.

7
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:24,440
In this lesson we'll look at various
methods for assessing those algorithms.
