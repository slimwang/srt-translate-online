00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:03,850
Howdy, Mark.
What you got going on there?

2
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:05,740
>> Oh, you know,
just working Android Studio.

3
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:08,510
Why are you wearing-
>> Android Studio?

4
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:11,110
Why you lily livered son of a droid.

5
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:13,020
Real code cowboys build
from the command line.

6
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:16,680
Just EMAX, ADB, and Gradle.

7
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:18,840
That's all I need to
build an Android app.

8
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:21,810
>> But there's code completion and
automatic refactoring.

9
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:26,370
>> Who even knows what's going on
inside one of them fancy city IDEs?

10
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:28,810
Could be anything happening
in the build process.

11
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:31,090
Not like good, old, honest,
hard working Gradle.

12
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:34,170
>> Android Studio doesn't
even use an internal builder.

13
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:38,270
What did you say, now?

14
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:41,160
>> Android Studio delegates its
entire build process to Gradle.

15
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:42,503
There's nothing magic happening.

16
00:00:42,503 --> 00:00:45,445
>> Whoa, that's super-cool.

17
00:00:45,445 --> 00:00:47,320
[COUGH] I mean.

18
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,530
Really now?

19
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:51,170
So, you're saying that I
could use Android Studio for

20
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:55,400
all them fancy code-completion features,
and still wrangle my build process?

21
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,370
>> Yeah, exactly.

22
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:59,160
See, look, I can pull up
my terminal Android Studio,

23
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:03,078
run my Gradle build task, and see.

24
00:01:03,078 --> 00:01:04,950
>> Oh my.

25
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:08,570
All them fancy features, and
it's just Gradle under the saddle.

26
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:10,540
I reckon I got some thinking to do.

27
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:11,490
Thanks for the tip, partner.
