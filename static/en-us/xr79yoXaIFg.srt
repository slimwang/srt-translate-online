1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:04,530
So, we actually have two right answers in this case. One set of answers could

2
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:10,364
be, f of x equals x plus 3, and g of x equals 1 over x squared. These two

3
00:00:10,364 --> 00:00:14,144
functions, when composed, will give us, f of g of x equals 1 over x squared

4
00:00:14,144 --> 00:00:20,200
plus 3, exactly what we're looking for. Our other option is this set, here we

5
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:26,869
have f of x equals 1 over x plus 3, and g of x equals x squared. This shows us

6
00:00:26,869 --> 00:00:30,005
that there are different ways to dissect functions and write them instead as

7
00:00:30,005 --> 00:00:32,360
compositions of other functions.
