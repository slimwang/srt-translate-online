00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,138
Let's Click and Drag, to see what the population is predicted to be by the blue

2
00:00:03,138 --> 00:00:12,955
curve. So I want an x coordinate of 2013, and there it is, 2013. And it says

3
00:00:12,955 --> 00:00:19,945
that the population should be 7.695 billion. So I'm going to round that number

4
00:00:19,945 --> 00:00:24,601
up, just for simplicity, to 7.7 billion. And is this a better prediction than

5
00:00:24,601 --> 00:00:29,739
the last one? I would say yes, definitely. We know the population 2013 is

6
00:00:29,739 --> 00:00:35,979
probably greater than that of 2011, which was already 7 billion people. 7.7

7
00:00:35,979 --> 00:00:41,930
billion is much closer to 7 billion than 3.2, our earlier prediction was.
