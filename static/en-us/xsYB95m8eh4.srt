00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
[Thrun] So in this final quiz we're going to see we can use a camera as a range sensor

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
or as a distance measuring device,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
provided that we know the size of the object we are looking at.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Suppose you're looking at a car, and we happen to know that this car is 160cm tall.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Imagine we take a picture of this car using a pinhole camera

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
with a focal length of 40mm,

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
and in our projection the car is 2mm tall.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
My question is what is the range? How far is this car away?

9
00:00:41,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Please answer in centimeters.
