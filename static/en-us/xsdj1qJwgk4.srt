1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:01,350
And in terms of narratives and

2
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:05,460
stories, do you have any examples of a visualization where you think this was

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:07,780
a great story, this told a really amazing story?

4
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:12,327
>> Yeah, one that struck me relatively recently is

5
00:00:12,327 --> 00:00:16,180
the slope graph that's on the cover of Alberto Cairo's book.

6
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,290
So here what we've got plotted is,

7
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:26,490
on the left hand side, the percent of higher educated population by state.

8
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:31,180
And then on the right hand side, the percent obese again by state.

9
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:34,010
And then a given state's connected by the line.

10
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:40,690
Which allows you to see relatively quickly the sort of inverse relationship here

11
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:44,790
across the blue states you know, positive relationship here in the red states.

12
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:48,180
And can allow you to really in a straightforward manner without really having to

13
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:51,710
explain too much about it get an understanding and

14
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:55,810
pick out interesting things, and again, start to form that story or narrative.

15
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:59,890
This was the, actually, the first time I encountered a slope graph, or

16
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:02,760
at least the first time that one stuck with me.

17
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,500
And I found it inspiring because there are actually a lot of

18
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:08,000
different use cases for graphs like this.

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,230
Which I hadn't really anticipated.

20
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:12,360
because you're really only plotting two data points, right?

21
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,020
>> Really. Yeah.

22
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:16,110
>> One way is you know, to look at things over time, and again,

23
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:18,230
with only two data points you think that's not that interesting.

24
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:20,190
But depending on your data it can be.

25
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:23,380
Or also the comparison of groups.

26
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:26,830
so, for example here in this little graph,

27
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:30,460
I'm plotting feedback from employees' survey.

28
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:34,850
Where on the left hand side, we have the percent favorable you know,

29
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:38,190
a summary metric for the survey for the overall company.

30
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:40,340
And on the right hand side, for a given team.

31
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:44,210
This can be your engineering organization, for example.

32
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:47,191
And you can see really quickly a whole lot of things, right?

33
00:01:47,191 --> 00:01:50,540
>> Right. >> So, on the left hand side you get the absolute values,

34
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:53,760
you get the relative rank ordering of the different dimensions.

35
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:56,390
You get those things on the right hand side as well.

36
00:01:56,390 --> 00:02:00,720
And then via the slope of the lines here, you get the percent difference between

37
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:04,228
the groups without ever having to explain what a percent difference is.

38
00:02:04,228 --> 00:02:08,483
So it's just a really efficient form of communication for

39
00:02:08,483 --> 00:02:10,440
the right circumstance.

40
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,770
>> Yeah, that's great.

41
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:14,619
When I look at this graph, one of my key takeaways is this.
