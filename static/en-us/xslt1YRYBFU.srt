00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:04,000
A final problem I want to mention can be called the Traceability Problem.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,360
The code of the program that uses a design pattern does not

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:12,050
necessarily make explicit that you're actually using the pattern.

4
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:16,160
You don't have to use the names of the classes taken from the book.

5
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,050
And, as you saw, there were lots of options with respect to implementation.

6
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:24,040
Consequently, somebody reading the code may not realize you're using a pattern.

7
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:28,690
Therefore, there's an extra obligation on you as a developer for documenting and

8
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:32,009
using certain naming conventions, so it's obvious what's going on.

9
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:35,340
If you're not careful, this can lead to increased the failure to

10
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:38,600
do this documentation can lead to increased fragmentation of the code,

11
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:41,880
having to do with the additional classes and methods which patterns introduce.
