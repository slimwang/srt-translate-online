1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:02,630
So to show you an example of what that

2
00:00:02,630 --> 00:00:07,647
looks like, we've created a test page that's in udacity.com

3
00:00:07,647 --> 00:00:12,570
cs101 index.html and when we run get all links

4
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:15,090
we'll see all the links on that page. Let me

5
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:17,410
show you what the page is first. This is

6
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:20,750
our test page for learning to crawl. So that's the

7
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:23,720
URL that we're using to get page and get all

8
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,510
links from that page. Now you see that this page

9
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:27,698
has three links on it. The first one goes to

10
00:00:27,698 --> 00:00:32,650
crawling.html, the second one goes to walking.html, and the third

11
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:36,410
one goes to flying.html. We'll look soon at the structure

12
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:39,950
of these pages when we do our web crawler. You can

13
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:42,360
try that on your own in the web browser. For

14
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,460
now, what we are interested in is finding these three links.

15
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:48,020
So when we assign links for the result to get

16
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:50,520
all links. We can print the value of links that we

17
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:53,710
get back. And when we run that, we see a list

18
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:56,620
containing the three links on the page. And because that is a

19
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:58,550
list, well, we can do useful things with it. We could

20
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:03,000
extract the value at position zero, and get just the first link

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,880
on the page. So think on your own, if you could

22
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:09,600
define get all links. If you're ambitious, you'll try to define this

23
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,100
all by yourself. We're going to step through how to do this with

24
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:15,730
a few quizzes because I think it's quite a challenging thing to

25
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:18,590
do all by yourself. But think about that by yourself first,

26
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:20,760
and then we'll step through it with a series of quizzes.
