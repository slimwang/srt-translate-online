00:00:00,552 --> 00:00:03,860
All right, so I am here in the course map where we

2
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:06,600
will discuss the things that we will learn in this class together.

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:11,020
This lesson, lesson 1 is an introduction.

4
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:13,480
Here we will explore Xcode.

5
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:17,471
Now you can think of Xcode as a canvas that will help us make an app.

6
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:22,830
Lesson one, will be all about making the basic structure of our app.

7
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:26,990
We will learn how to add buttons, images, and text.

8
00:00:28,228 --> 00:00:31,650
In Lesson three, we will learn how to play sounds from our phone.

9
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:33,010
And we will also figure out,

10
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:37,020
how our app will navigate from one screen to the other.

11
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:41,020
Towards the end, in Lesson four, we will record our voice and

12
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:44,010
we will run our app on a physical device.

13
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:46,270
Now, throughout all of these lessons,

14
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:50,750
we will be asking you questions that will push your understanding on Swift.

15
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:52,720
Here is the first of those questions
