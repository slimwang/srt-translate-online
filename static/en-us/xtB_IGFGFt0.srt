1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The first machine that was built to do this was called the Heath Robinson.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
It was named after this British cartoonist

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
who drew cartoons of crazy machines to do operations.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
This one was for peeling potatoes.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
The timeline of this is quite interesting.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
The first operator mistake--the re-transmission with abbreviations--

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
happened in August 1941. That was intercepted.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Over the next year that was enough to learn from the two intercepted messages

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
the structure of the machine and then to understand it well enough

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
to develop this technique--the double-Delta technique for finding

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
the correct configuration and to break messages.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
By December 1942 they decided to build a machine and put the resources necessary

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
to design and build the machine.

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
It was requested to be done by June of 1943.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
It was actually delivered 3 months early.

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
By April 1943 they had the first machine delivered and operational.

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
It could process messages about 2000 characters per second.

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,000
It was able to do 7 XOR operations at 20 km per hour.

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
This was not quite fast enough.

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
A lot of the value in decrypting messages, especially in war time,

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
is being able to decrypt them before what the message is describing actually happen.

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
They built a faster machine.

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
The faster machine was called "Colossus."

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
This was operational by January 1944, and the big change that made Colossus much faster

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
and more useful than the Heath Robinson machines

26
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
was that they replaced the configurations, which were previously on a tape,

27
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
with an electronic keytext generator.

28
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
The logic is doing all the XORs and counting the number that are zero.

29
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Then it's printing out those tallies so you can go back and find the right configuration.

30
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
The ciphertext is still on a paper tape.

31
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
This is spinning through about 50 km an hour.

32
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
It was a pretty impressive sight when it was operating.

33
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Processing 5000 characters per second.

34
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
What made this arguably the first computer was because of electronic keytext

35
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
this logic was a little bit programmable.

36
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
It didn't do always exactly the same thing.

37
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
There were ways to program it to do slightly different operations depending on

38
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
what the analysts through was the most useful thing to do with that intercepted cipher text.

39
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,000
This is arguably the first programmable digital electronic computer.

40
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
It wasn't fully programmable. It wasn't a general purpose computer.

41
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
But it could be programmed to change its behavior slightly.

42
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
You can see what this looked like during World War II.

43
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
There are very few pictures of it. This was a very secretive operation.

44
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
The machines were actually all destroyed after the war.

45
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
A lot of the value in breaking a cipher is to make sure that no one else knows you've broken it.

46
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
This is different from academic cryptography where people

47
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
like to publicized when they break ciphers.

48
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
In military cryptography the whole value of breaking a cipher is your enemy keeps using it.

49
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
You want to keep it very secretive that you've done that.

50
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
A lot of the work on Colossus was not declassified until the mid-90s.

51
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Today if you visit Bletchley Park you can see a replica, a rebuilt version of Colossus.

52
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
This is my picture of it from 2004.

53
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
It does look very similar to the black and white picture from World War II.

54
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Unfortunately, they don't operate it frequently, so you won't get to see the tape

55
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
spinning through at 50 km an hour and all the crunching going on

56
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:26,000
unless you're very lucky to go one of the few days a year that they might actually operate it.

57
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
These Colossus machines had a huge impact on World War II.

58
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
By the end of the war there were 10 of them continuously operating at Bletchley Park

59
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
decrypting all the traffic that they could intercept.

60
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:41,000
They decoded over 63 million letters of messages in Axis communications.

61
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Among the things they learned from them were the troop locations of Axis on D-Day.

62
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
This was very helpful for planning the operation.

63
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Why did I tell you this story?

64
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
First of all it is an important story in the history of both the world as well as computing,

65
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:02,000
but this isn't meant to be a history class, although I certainly like to have historical excursions when I can.

66
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
It's also very relevant to modern cryptanalysis.

67
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Modern ciphers are much better than the Lorenz cipher,

68
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,000
and the main reason for that is we can use computing power to do the encryption.

69
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
But the basic ideas are actually quite similar.

70
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,000
The goal of the cipher is hide all the statistical properties that are inherent in the message,

71
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
and they're present in the key--at least the generated key.

72
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
The actual key we hope is perfectly random.

73
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Finding perfect randomness and getting it in computing is quite challenging.

74
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
But let's assume we have a perfectly random key.

75
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
What we learned from the perfect cipher analysis

76
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
is that the key must be shorter than the message.

77
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
That means in order for the cipher to work,

78
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
we need to generate more key bits than we actually have.

79
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Even if the original key--and you can think of that in the case of Colossus

80
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
as the configuration of the machine that comes from some code book

81
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000
that could be perfectly randomly generated and shared between endpoints.

82
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
That is only the starting configuration.

83
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,000
There is some larger key that has to be generated to produce the cipher text.

84
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
So both the key and the message have some statistical properties.

85
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
The goal of cipher is to hide all those properties.

86
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
The goal of the analyst is to find statistical properties in the cipher text

87
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
and then to use those to break the key or the message.

88
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:30,000
In the case of Bletchley Park breaking the Lorenz cipher, they found statistical properties.

89
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
When you looked across channels at subsequent letters,

90
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
there were some statistical properties that were not hidden by the cipher.

91
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:43,000
That was because of a mechanical weakness that all the S wheels either all moved or didn't move.

92
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:50,000
That meant that instead of having the long period with no repetition of 19 million letters

93
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
that the users of those Lorenz machines thought it had,

94
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:00,000
the Allies could break that down and find a pattern that was only 12,071 letters long

95
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
with much fewer configurations to try to have a good guess of the cipher

96
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
with many fewer guesses needed.

97
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
In a modern cipher we think of that as a mathematical weakness.

98
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
There's some problem is the mathematics of the cipher

99
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,000
that leaves some statistical property that a cryptanalyst could exploit.

100
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:24,000
The other relevance to modern cryptanalysis is it's really lots of hard work to do that.

101
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I find it quite amazing what Bletchley Park was able to do with Colossus.

102
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,000
It still took 6 months of effort looking at those two messages to figure out the key

103
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
and interpret the key structure from that.

104
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:44,000
That requires an awful lot of trial and error and a lot of creativity but also a lot of tedious work.

105
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,000
In modern cryptanalysis we try to do as much of the tedious work as possible by computers,

106
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
but there is still lots of hard work that goes into breaking a cipher.

107
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Motivation certainly helps a lot for that.

108
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
In the case of Bletchley Park, the fear that your country was under attack

109
00:06:59,000 --> 99:59:59,999
is a pretty strong motivation.
