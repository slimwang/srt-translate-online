1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,270
One of the interesting thing about costs is that in the old days costs and revenue,

2
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:10,910
the minute you started your company, your investors said oh, we know how to track all this.

3
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:15,020
We want you to fill out an income statement, a balance sheet, and cash flow,

4
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:20,060
and we want you to do accounting from day 1 which gives us visibility and forecast, etc.

5
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:24,570
The problem is these were execution metrics.

6
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:27,770
Existing companies execute known plans.

7
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:31,900
You could in fact do all the spreadsheets you want for every board meeting,

8
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:35,470
but in fact they're not worth the paper they're printed on.

9
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:40,050
But you and your maybe rent-a-CFO or accountant have spent a lot of time.

10
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:43,650
Now understand that your VCs or investors, if their professionals,

11
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:45,610
need them for their investors.

12
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:51,150
But what you really need to be doing is working with your investors and your management team

13
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:54,720
is to derive the metrics that matter.

14
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:58,060
If your investors really want to see income statements, balance sheet, client referral,

15
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:01,530
great you could give them fantasy documents all they want.

16
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:05,230
But what your really interested in is trying to understand,

17
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:08,990
what are the metrics that matter for your business?

18
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:11,040
I'll give you some examples.

19
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,050
In value proposition, what was the product cost?

20
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:16,240
What was the market size? What share could you take?

21
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,250
What is the competition? What are they charging?

22
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:23,920
In customer relationships all the get-keep-grow metrics, some of which we talked about,

23
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,350
some of which you'll discover, what were the customer acquistion costs?

24
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:30,930
What were the conversion rates? What was the lifetime value?

25
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:32,930
These are key metrics.

26
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:34,930
This is a lot more important than what is revenue in year 4,

27
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:36,930
because you're just guessing about that.

28
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:39,930
But these are numbers you're going to be living with every day.

29
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:42,540
By the way, what market type are you in?

30
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:47,270
If you remember from our earlier lectures, if you're an existing market,

31
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:51,570
that's a different type of revenue curve than being in a new market.

32
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:53,620
Do your investors still agree?

33
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:58,550
What are your operating costs? What are the basic fixed and variable costs of the business?

34
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:03,140
What's the cost of your channel? What's the margin, the channel needs?

35
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:05,690
How much are you going to have to spend on channel promotion,

36
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:10,008
shelf space, any other channel extra charges?

37
00:02:10,008 --> 00:02:12,770
Then again for your revenue stream.

38
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:16,940
Do you now know with certainty the average selling price, the number of customers per year,

39
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:20,920
achievable revenue, how long it takes to close a sell?

40
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:24,950
Here's the number that actually intersects with one of the ones that your investors

41
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:26,950
are worrying about all the time.

42
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:30,880
How much money are you spending per month?

43
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:34,390
Often called burn rate.

44
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:39,190
Not only how are you burning per month, but when we just calculate that out,

45
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:41,930
when will you run out of money?

46
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:49,620
All these numbers are ones that you as founders need to have on the top of your head.

47
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:57,330
No startup has 300 numbers. There's probably somewhere between 5-15 that matter.

48
00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:03,480
Maybe you could be the exception, but you as the founder need to know all these parameters.

49
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:09,360
In fact the exercises, see if you could go up to a white board and list them.

50
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,090
If you can't, understand that that's your job in searching for the business model.

51
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:19,300
When you know these numbers, the spreadsheets fall out of these.

52
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:24,870
But trying to do it ab initio from some guessing spreadsheet just is some fantasy.

53
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:31,580
You need to get these metrics that matter known, searched, understood, and don't worry,

54
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:36,100
they will change, but the whole game of the business model canvas and the customer

55
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:40,520
development process was for you to find them out firsthand and to experience them,

56
00:03:40,520 --> 99:59:59,999
not to have them happen to you.
