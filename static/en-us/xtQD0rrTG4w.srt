1
00:00:00,004 --> 00:00:04,798
For this problem, x equals 1 3rd. Excellent problem solving if you found this

2
00:00:04,798 --> 00:00:08,826
fraction. Again, we'll start by multiplying these 2 arguments together, since

3
00:00:08,826 --> 00:00:15,665
we're adding the logs with the same base. So 2x times 3x equals 6x squared. And

4
00:00:15,665 --> 00:00:21,440
2x times positive 5 is positive 10x. The log of base 3 of 4 just stays on the

5
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:27,400
right hand side. This means we can set this expression equal to 4. Since we

6
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:31,180
have one logarithm of base 3 on one side and another logarithm of base 3 on the

7
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:37,639
other. We subtract 4 from each side of the equation to get 6x squared plus 10x

8
00:00:37,639 --> 00:00:45,468
minus 4 equals 0. Now this equation has even coefficients. So I can just divide

9
00:00:45,468 --> 00:00:51,552
through by a positive 2. Now I can fator this quadratic. Next, we use factoring

10
00:00:51,552 --> 00:00:56,960
by grouping to get the factors of 3x minus 1 and x plus 2. We can set each of

11
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:03,525
these factors equal to 0 and then solve for x. So x can equal positive 1 3rd or

12
00:01:03,525 --> 00:01:09,097
x can equal negative 2. When we look back at the original problem, a value of

13
00:01:09,097 --> 00:01:12,991
negative 2 for x would make this argument negative, and this argument negative

14
00:01:12,991 --> 00:01:19,020
as well. We can't take a logarithm of a negative number, so this solution is

15
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:23,370
out. Our only solution is, x equals one third.
