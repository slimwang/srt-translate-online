00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:03,340
Now that you know where the first sentence ends, you also know where the second

2
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:08,186
sentence starts. Write a method, public String getSecondSentence that returns a

3
00:00:08,186 --> 00:00:11,962
piece of the book, starting after the first sentence and ending after the end

4
00:00:11,962 --> 00:00:16,887
of the second sentence. Here's a hint, indexOf has several versions, one of

5
00:00:16,887 --> 00:00:20,121
them just finds the first occurrence of something but there are others that are

6
00:00:20,121 --> 00:00:22,010
more flexible.
