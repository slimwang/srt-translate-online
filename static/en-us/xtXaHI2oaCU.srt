00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:03,890
The answer is, the first one can be written as an enhanced for loop. These

2
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:07,607
other two would require lots of extra counting variables and things to make

3
00:00:07,607 --> 00:00:12,224
them work that way. This one would be difficult to write as an enhanced for

4
00:00:12,224 --> 00:00:15,941
loop because it's using the index i to calculate a value, it's also changing

5
00:00:15,941 --> 00:00:21,106
the values stored in the array. Both of those things are harder to do with an

6
00:00:21,106 --> 00:00:25,084
enhanced for loop. This one would be hard to do with an enhanced for loop,

7
00:00:25,084 --> 00:00:29,420
because it's not actually looking at all of the values in order. It starts at

8
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:34,132
Index one, and while looking at any one index, it's also looking at the last

9
00:00:34,132 --> 00:00:39,011
index. In an enhanced for loop, you will only get one at a time, and would have

10
00:00:39,011 --> 00:00:43,927
to do some fancy trick to remember the last one that you'd seen. This way is

11
00:00:43,927 --> 00:00:45,109
much simpler.
