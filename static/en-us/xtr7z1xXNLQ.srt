1
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:03,750
Let's select the horizontal constraint.

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:07,419
In the inspector,
you can see all of its properties,

3
00:00:07,419 --> 00:00:10,519
some definitely seem mysterious.

4
00:00:10,519 --> 00:00:14,809
First Item, Second Item,
Relation, Constant,

5
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:19,000
Priority, Multiplier, and Constant.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,489
What's all this about?

7
00:00:20,489 --> 00:00:24,199
Brace yourselves, for math is coming.

8
00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:30,059
A constraint is a relationship between
two properties plus a priority.

9
00:00:30,059 --> 00:00:32,408
Let's worry about
the relationship first.

10
00:00:32,408 --> 00:00:38,089
We told Auto Layout that the leading
edge of the stack view was equal

11
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:43,760
to the leading margin of
the super view plus something.

12
00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:47,503
There you have the properties
Leading Space, and

13
00:00:47,503 --> 00:00:51,909
Leading Margin and
the relationship, equal.

14
00:00:51,909 --> 00:00:56,519
So in this case, that equation
actually means that the leading space

15
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:01,270
of the stack view is equal to
the leading margin of the super view,

16
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:07,730
multiplied by something, 1,
plus a constant value, 7 in this case.

17
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:12,670
You can see this equation
on the top right corner

18
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:15,430
of Xcode when you click on a constant.

19
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:17,760
Click on the vertical one now.

20
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:21,690
Now, let's change its
constant to Standard Value.

21
00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:25,295
That's what Apple recommends as
a separation between the items.

22
00:01:25,296 --> 00:01:31,350
Jony Ive knows more about design than
I do, so let's accept this suggestion.

23
00:01:31,349 --> 00:01:35,869
A priority means how important it
is to fulfill this requirement.

24
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:39,930
The default value is 1,000,
which means it's a must.

25
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:41,860
We won't mess with this very often.

26
00:01:41,859 --> 00:01:45,989
In the next video, we'll learn how to
preview our UI in different devices.
