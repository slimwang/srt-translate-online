00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,540
Playing with picture objects in BlueJ is kind of fun. Let me make a couple of

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:08,240
picture objects. If you look carefully how I constructed the last object, I

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,320
filled in the name of the file here. And I'll do it one more time like that. If

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:17,920
you do it in this way, you also have to tell the program to draw the objects by

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:24,070
selecting the draw method. The first picture appears, and a second picture

6
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:27,720
appears. That looks kind of horrible. Let's have a closer look on how we can

7
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:34,118
make this look nicer. First of all, let's move the rocket a little bit, and

8
00:00:34,118 --> 00:00:48,280
let's make the red planet a bit smaller. Well, that's much nicer. But it's a

9
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:52,390
bit tedious to do this with your hands and with clicking and clicking, that's

10
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:57,320
where programming comes in. Here I've written a program that does the same

11
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:03,640
actions, that you've just seen me do by clicking in a java program, a step at a

12
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:08,500
time. We'll understand all of the details pretty soon, but let me show you the

13
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:14,329
basic lay of the land. We're making a picture out of the mariner4 image, we're

14
00:01:14,329 --> 00:01:20,950
translating it, we're drawing it, we're making another picture object, we're

15
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:25,570
shrinking it and we're drawing it, and that composes the picture. Now when you

16
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:31,230
operate in this way, you make an object and then you later need to do something

17
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:36,180
to that object. And it's, it's in a program here, it's not in the BlueJ work

18
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:41,220
bench. And then it becomes very important to give names to each of the

19
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:47,194
pictures. You'll notice I call this one rocket. I call this one planet. Those

20
00:01:47,194 --> 00:01:51,900
names are names of variables, and that what we're want to discuss next.
