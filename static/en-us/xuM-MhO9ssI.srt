1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,980
Now just to familiarize yourself with these problems a little bit more,

2
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:07,380
I would like to do the same thing that we have done here for these five problems.

3
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:11,290
I will now give you a number of practical scenarios.

4
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:15,920
What I would like you to tell me is which of these problems would probably be most useful

5
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,360
for attempting an NP completeness proof?

6
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:23,570
So again we will give these problems here numbers, one, two, three, and four,

7
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:28,480
and I will give you six practical scenarios where you can then choose

8
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:33,350
which problem to match to the scenarios, so you could have a scenario in Bioinformatics,

9
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:36,800
but you would like to compare DNA sequences to each other.

10
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:41,240
And what you are trying to find out is how much information they have in common.

11
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:44,420
You could have a scenario where you want to schedule computer programs.

12
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:47,470
What I mean by this is you have a bunch of computer programs.

13
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:51,950
You know approximately how much time you took those programs is going to take.

14
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:56,300
And you have a number of machines and of course you want to get as much work done as possible

15
00:00:56,300 --> 00:01:02,070
within let's say the next hour so you have to decide which program to run on which machine

16
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:05,370
or you could have a question about let's say classrooms where you say,

17
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:10,220
"How many classrooms do we actually need for the next semester to teach our courses?"

18
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:15,630
So there will be certain courses that take place at a certain time or that cannot be scheduled together.

19
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:18,470
A new question is how many different rooms would we actually need?

20
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:20,590
Or you could have the scenario where two programmers

21
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:23,290
have been working on the same programming code.

22
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:28,330
And one of the programmers has made some changes and the other one has made some changes.

23
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:31,410
And now you need to get these two codes back together again,

24
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:34,480
and you do that by figuring out what they actually still have in common.

25
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:38,250
Another problem could be that you have a number of vans or delivery trucks

26
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:41,380
that you would like to fill and you want to find out

27
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:45,280
how many vans you need to transport all of these packages here.

28
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,020
They have different sizes. They have different priorities and so on.

29
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:54,570
And finally, a scenario that is none of the above so something else.

30
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:59,440
Please match the practical scenarios to the NP complete problem

31
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:04,390
that is most likely to occur in that scenario, and I want you to do this by entering numbers here

32
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:06,250
that correspond to these four problems.

33
00:02:06,250 --> 99:59:59,999
You'll have to use some of these problems here more than once.
