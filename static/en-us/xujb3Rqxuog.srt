00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:02,530
Our goal is to get you
a job in machine learning.

2
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:04,910
So we highly recommend you take
advantage of the opportunities that

00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:06,270
Marion described.

The career development opportunities
throughout this nanodegree program

5
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:11,160
are just as important
as the content itself.

6
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,780
And we encourage you to take advantage
of everything you're enrollment in this

need to know the material.

10
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:24,190
So let's get started talking about
the foundations of the machine learning
