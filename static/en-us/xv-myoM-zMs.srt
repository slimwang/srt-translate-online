1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,790
Okay, so the answer to this is that
we'll update the score to be 3 more than

2
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:07,450
it was before and then we'll display it.

3
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:11,240
Another way to say update the score
to be 3 more than it was before

4
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:14,140
is to say increase the score by 3.

5
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:19,710
So Step 1 would be D and
then to display the score is Step 2.

6
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:20,590
So, I'll select A.

7
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:24,270
Okay, so
these are the correct two choices.

8
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:27,340
We need to be clear that we're
increasing the score, which means that

9
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:30,530
we're taking the old value of
the score and we're adding 3 to it.

10
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:34,760
Okay, so let's look at this with
a little bit more detail as to why this

11
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:36,290
will correctly work.

12
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:38,860
Okay, so my score starts at 0.

13
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:40,960
And then I click the +3 button.

14
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,390
According to my Step 1,
I first increased the score by 3.

15
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:48,110
It's currently 0,
I add 3 to it, it becomes 3.

16
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:49,640
Okay, so far, so good.

17
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:54,720
And then, in the next step,
I display it to the phone screen.

18
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:56,450
Let's draw a little phone.

19
00:00:56,450 --> 00:01:00,090
Okay, so there's my phone, and
it will display the score, which is 3.

20
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:02,150
Looks pretty good.

21
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:06,220
I press it again, it goes and
looks at the current score, and

22
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:08,160
then increases it by 3.

23
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,630
Making it become 6.

24
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:11,810
And then, it displays it to the phone.

25
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:14,280
And I can see pretty quickly
that as I keep pressing it,

26
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,920
the pattern will repeat itself,
it'll update, it'll display.

27
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,490
So that seems pretty good.

28
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:21,240
Now, one of the things you might
have gotten wrong is maybe switching

29
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,780
the order of these two.

30
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:24,160
So let's see how that would work.

31
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:26,240
Okay, so here's the step switch.

32
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,100
If I click the +3 button,

33
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:31,540
the first thing that I do in this
ordering is to display the score.

34
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:35,595
So it looks at scoreTeamA, and it's 0,

35
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:40,605
so it removes whatever was there
before and displays 0 to the screen.

36
00:01:40,605 --> 00:01:44,005
Then I increase the score by 3.

37
00:01:44,005 --> 00:01:47,590
Hm, okay, well, so it's displaying 0,
but the score's actually 3.

38
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:52,500
When I hit this again, remember, at this
point, the team has scored six points.

39
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:57,400
It goes and looks at my score
which is 3, and displays it,

40
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:00,305
and then it increases the score by 3.

41
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:02,050
Hm.

42
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:06,880
Okay, so in this case it seems that
my score is always three points

43
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:11,530
ahead of what's actually being displayed
on the screen, and that's no good.

44
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:13,830
Okay, so let's look at this scenario.

45
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:16,600
I press the +3 point button.

46
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:19,690
And Step 1 is to set scoreTeamA to 3.

47
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:23,480
And then,
Step 2 is to display that score.

48
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,890
Okay, that looks pretty good.

49
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:28,290
I press +3 Points, and
it's displaying 3.

50
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:30,550
Now, I press it again, though.

51
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:33,241
And Step 1 is to set scoreTeamA to 3.

52
00:02:34,692 --> 00:02:37,787
Kind of silly, but
that's what you told it to do.

53
00:02:37,787 --> 00:02:39,900
And then display scoreTeamA.

54
00:02:41,085 --> 00:02:46,839
So as you might be able to see, I could
keep clicking +3, but it's going to

55
00:02:46,839 --> 00:02:50,675
just remain at 3, because it'll keep
setting it to 3 and then displaying 3.

56
00:02:50,675 --> 00:02:54,540
This is actually essentially what we're
already doing right now with the app.

57
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:56,630
But instead of simply saying display 3,

58
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:59,750
we're using a variable
that's value is always 3.

59
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:03,540
Okay, let's look at another example.

60
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:07,270
Now, you might have found
this option very alluring.

61
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:10,960
After all, it's saying display and
it's saying to add 3,

62
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,210
and that just seems like it's right.

63
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:16,100
Now, I'm not even going to put
anything in for Step 2 right now.

64
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:19,680
I'm just going to see what happens if
this is the only step that occurs.

65
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,330
So, I press +3 Points.

66
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:26,520
And then it displays the scoreTeamA +3.

67
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:30,140
So I look at the score for Team A,
which is 0, and then I add 3 to it.

68
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:31,450
So it's going to display 3.

69
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:34,730
Okay, that's looking pretty good.

70
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:38,800
Press it again, and
it's going to display the score for

71
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:42,470
Team A, which is still 0,
and then add 3, which is 3.

72
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:46,440
Hm, so this has the same
problem as the last one,

73
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,630
it's just going to keep displaying 3.

74
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:53,030
And this is because when I
say display scoreTeamA +3,

75
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:56,635
it's not actually changing the value
that's inside of scoreTeamA.

76
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:01,130
It's just using that value
to do some calculation.

77
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:03,440
Now, there is a way I could
actually get this to work.

78
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:05,370
Okay.

79
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:06,690
Let's look at this one.

80
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:10,104
So I press the +3 points button,
and it goes to Step 1,

81
00:04:10,104 --> 00:04:13,120
which is to display the scoreTeamA +3.

82
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,620
ScoreTeamA was 0, so 0 plus 3 is 3.

83
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:19,345
And then,
it increases the score of Team A by 3.

84
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,540
Okay.

85
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:25,260
I press the button again, it looks
at the score of Team A, which is 3,

86
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:28,020
and it adds 3, so it displays 6.

87
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:31,290
Then, it increases
the score of Team A by 3.

88
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:34,500
So, this is looking pretty good, and

89
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,940
it actually is technically
a correct answer.

90
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:40,910
It will do what you want it to do,
but it's a little inefficient and

91
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:43,050
strange for a couple of reasons.

92
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:45,364
First, you do the same
calculation twice.

93
00:04:45,364 --> 00:04:48,660
Here you're adding scoreTeamA +3 and

94
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:53,840
when you do the increase you have
add scoreTeamA +3 which uncovers how

95
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,590
it's generally just a little backwards
the way that were doing things.

96
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:01,390
This ordering seems a little bit more
difficult to understand, it's also

97
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:05,787
just a little bit more complicated
because you added that extra step.

98
00:05:05,787 --> 00:05:08,960
So, increasing the score by 3 and
then displaying

99
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,540
is a more straightforward answer, and
the one that I'm going to go with.
