1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The one we're thinking about this is that there is degrees of hardness of different kinds or problems.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Kind of like rocks. If you've ever studied rocks there is a scale for how hard a rock a is.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Well there's kind of a scale for how hard problems are as well and some of the entries on this scale

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
include things like, well some problems are actually not computable.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
We can define a problem and we can show that

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
there is no computer program that can actually solve that problem.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
That's hard and sometimes that's maybe as hard as you can imagine.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
An example of a problem in this class is the halting problem,

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
and you can see I have music video about the halting problem if you want to take a look at it,

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
but we're not going to talk about it more in this class.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
There some other problems like I mentioned before that are computable.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
We can actually solve them with a computer program, but they require at least exponential time.

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I mentioned generalized checkers is an example of that.

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
There's problems that are computable and can be solved in polynomial time

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
like the shortest path problem with Dijkstra's algorithm, and some are computable

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
can be solved really quickly in linear time at the same amount of time

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
it would take to just look at the example.

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
You can actually get an answer.

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
So graph connectivity is an example of a problem in that class.

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:28,000
So the way we think about this is the hardness of a problem like how two nodes in a graph connected.

21
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The hardness of the problem is the running time of the very best possible algorithm for that problem.

22
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
For some problems, we're not exactly sure how hard they are,

23
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
but we have lower bounds and upper bounds.

24
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:49,000
So for example, we might know that a certain problem requires at least nÂ˛ time to solve,

25
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
but we know that it requires no more than nâľ.

26
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:59,000
So the true complexity, the true hardness of this problem is somewhere between those two bounds.

27
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
So here's a question for you. What's a good way to find an upper bound on a problem's hardness?

28
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
We know an upper bound and a lower bound that gives us a sense of how hard the problem is.

29
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
How do we find an upper bound? So here's some choices.

30
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
One is device an algorithm to solve the problem, run it on a bunch of inputs,

31
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
and then look on the graph to see what the shape of it is and that tells us the bound.

32
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
So that's one choice. Another choice is. Again device an algorithm to solve it.

33
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Run that algorithm on all possible inputs and take a look at the running time that results from this

34
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
that gives you the upper bound.

35
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Third you can imagine devising an algorithm to solve the problem and then analyzing it,

36
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
and whenever the big O or big Î is that you get from that analysis is an upper bound

37
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:51,000
on the hardness of the problem, and then the final choice is, this is a trick question.

38
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
The whole question of upper bounds must be some other class

39
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
because it's not what we've been studying in this class.

40
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
So decide which one do you think is the most appropriate and check it off.
