1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,940
Let's examine some of the building
blocks of a time series.

2
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:07,130
Ever since mankind first noticed
the regular movement of the sun and

3
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:10,320
the stars, we have wondered
about the passage of time.

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,660
Our ancestors first recorded the phases
of the moon some 30,000 years ago, and

5
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:18,230
recording time has been a way by which
humanity has represented the progress of

6
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:19,760
civilization.

7
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,800
It's how we plan, schedule, or arrange
when something should happen or be done.

8
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,230
It's the events in our past,
present, and future.

9
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:32,020
For us, in this course, we'll discuss
time a little less philosophically, and

10
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:35,650
concentrate on the data that is
collected on recorded time periods.

11
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:38,590
The first defining characteristic
of a time series is a list

12
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:41,520
of observations where
the ordering matters.

13
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,790
Ordering is very important because
there is a dependency on time and

14
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:46,890
changing the order could change
the meaning of the data.

15
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,645
Now, to accurately
forecast future values,

16
00:00:50,645 --> 00:00:54,050
we'll need each measurement of data
to be taken across sequential and

17
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:58,510
equal intervals, and with each time
unit having at most one data point.

18
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:02,160
Once we have collected our data,
as a business analyst,

19
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,050
we have two objectives in mind.

20
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:07,260
First, identifying the patterns
represented by the sequence of

21
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:10,430
observations, and second, forecasting or

22
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:12,750
predicting future values
of the time series.

23
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:17,290
The patterns we observe will tell us the
story of how our business interacts with

24
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:17,590
time.
