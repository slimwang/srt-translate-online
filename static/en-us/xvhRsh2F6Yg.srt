1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,230
This question is sort of a big deal, it's where the

2
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:07,310
final project begins. And so work you do in this question

3
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:09,930
may wind up contributing to what you submit for your final

4
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:13,030
project submission at the end of the class. Since your final

5
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:16,050
project is the design of an app, the first step is

6
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:19,010
to answer the question, what app are you going to build?

7
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:21,640
And at this point I should mention it's okay to not

8
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:25,590
be thinking of personas and use cases and high level flows here.

9
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:28,210
This is where you decide on the project that is going

10
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:32,080
to excite you and keep you motivated, without that excitement probably

11
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:35,110
won't even build anything at all. So it's really important that

12
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:37,540
we start with what app do you want to build and here

13
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:40,760
we're really just talking about maybe a two to three sentence

14
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:44,830
explanation. Any more detail than that and you probably want to have

15
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:47,880
an idea of who your users are and what this app

16
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:50,650
is going to do at a high level. Keep in mind that

17
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:52,640
though you are going to be coming back to

18
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,100
this final project throughout the class you can always

19
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,650
change your idea. So don't feel like whatever you

20
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:00,400
do here you have to be too committed to.
