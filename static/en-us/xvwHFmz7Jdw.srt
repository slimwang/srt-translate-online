1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:01,609
Of course work and

2
00:00:01,609 --> 00:00:05,290
understanding how the brain processes
visual information continues.

3
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:10,510
One of the interesting things has been,
sort of, separating out the, there

4
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:14,240
seems to be work in, in, understanding
that the layout of your visual field,

5
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,370
the geometry of your field is different
than understanding what's in your

6
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:22,154
field that is the, the,
detection of things.

7
00:00:22,154 --> 00:00:26,190
And so notionally here,
here's an interesting little picture.

8
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:32,780
The idea is that things come in, in V1
and then V2 starts to go up this area.

9
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:36,150
This is the V3, V4 subsegment that
sort of does the recognition.

10
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:38,950
This is sort of what's there.

11
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:42,730
At the same time, there seems to be
what's referred to as this action

12
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:48,270
pathway where V1 has a lot of
projections into this V3 V5 area

13
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:52,180
that's sensitive to, it is sensitive
to shape, but the movements of shapes.

14
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:53,410
And then there's always connections,

15
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:55,270
cause there's connections
everywhere in the brain.

16
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:57,170
But the idea is that
in the parietal lobes,

17
00:00:57,170 --> 00:01:01,390
that's a different structure up here,
is more of an understanding of action.

18
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:05,370
So you have this one pathway that's
sort of the stuff that's there, and

19
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:07,990
another one that has to do with
sort of how stuff's moving,

20
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:10,240
or, or where stuff is moving.

21
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,360
There's another whole cool area of,

22
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:15,960
another cool way of investigating
what goes on in the brain.

23
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:19,990
If you presume that there are these
different kinds of process steps

24
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:24,420
going on in different locations, then
you would expect that people who have

25
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:30,190
certain types of brain injuries or,
or birth defect issues or

26
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:32,770
whatever, that certain parts of
the brain aren't working You would be

27
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:38,080
able to find selective elements of
their visual processing not function.

28
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,230
We know this is true in language.

29
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:42,980
Strokes in different areas can cause you
to lose either semantics versus syntax.

30
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:45,550
So what happens in vision?

31
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:48,470
Well, there's this
very well known woman.

32
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:53,550
She has this very interesting phenomena,
she cannot see motion.

33
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:55,250
So like, she can't cross a street.

34
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:59,050
She'll look down there and
she'll see the car there.

35
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:02,580
And then, you know, two seconds later,
she'll see the car here.

36
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:07,900
But she has no perception that
the car is actually moving.

37
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:10,940
'Kay, so
she can't actually cross the street.

38
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:12,570
All right?
Because she doesn't get any

39
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:16,930
understanding of sort of that
space time evolution of things.

40
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:20,490
So that, you can think of that as
an example of there's this part that's

41
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:24,470
doing this motion and action stuff that,
in her brain, is just not working.

42
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:26,690
Remember she recognizes cars and

43
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:29,820
toothpaste and all the different
kinds of things in her world.

44
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:33,390
But she doesn't get a perception
of the motion and the action.

45
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:36,310
And this is the type of thing that
leads further credence to the idea that

46
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:40,160
there's a separate pathway, this,
this separate part of the brain that is

47
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:44,810
processing this kind of information
that obviously she doesn't have.

48
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:49,630
So, the idea would be that you know
this action pathway shown here Somehow

49
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:54,650
is not functioning as well as
it should in her, in her brain.
