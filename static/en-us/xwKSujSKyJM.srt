00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:14,640
>> Well, you're right about that. Software systems have long lifetimes.

2
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:17,870
During which they undergo evolutionary change.

3
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:21,670
Unless, the responsible developers are careful. The original structure of

4
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:25,390
the program may be lost as features are added, bugs fixed and

5
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:30,490
libraries migrated. For example, consider a banking application. Over time,

6
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:35,380
the particular functions such as interest computation, fees and tax rules may

7
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:40,800
change. All of these are functions. However, the need to represent accounts,

8
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,040
account holders and transactions. All of which are objects, will continue.

9
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:49,560
That is objects are more stable than functions, over the lifetime of a system.

10
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:53,480
Hence, designing a software around them, leads to more sustainable designs.
