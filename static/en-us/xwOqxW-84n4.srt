00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,430
Now, we have all the tools we need to draw a parabola from an equation.

2
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:07,056
Regardless of what form it's in, when we first look at it. We can find the

3
00:00:07,056 --> 00:00:10,840
vertex, and we can find the x and y intercepts. This will definitely give us

4
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:14,828
enough points to connect into a smooth curve. So let's put all of this together.

5
00:00:14,828 --> 00:00:19,010
If we have the equation, y equals x squared plus 5x plus 4. What are the

6
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:22,633
y-intercepts of the graph, its x-intercepts, and its vertex?
