1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,968
So, the teacher isn't getting
to pick questions anymore?

2
00:00:02,968 --> 00:00:05,530
>> No, the teacher's going to do,
the teacher is going to say,

3
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:07,833
here's where I think the level
of understanding it.

4
00:00:07,833 --> 00:00:08,340
>> Kay.

5
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:10,432
>> And then,
questions will be generated accordingly.

6
00:00:10,432 --> 00:00:11,970
>> Ooh, maybe from Gaussian.

7
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:16,589
>> Maybe from a Gaussian, and in fact,
what I'm going to suggest we do is that

8
00:00:16,589 --> 00:00:19,184
we're going to say you
need to pick a line.

9
00:00:19,184 --> 00:00:21,470
Now, why should you pick
one line over the other?

10
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:25,770
Because I'm going to set up
the incentive, so that you get plus one

11
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:32,009
any time the learner answers correctly
something they should get wrong.

12
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:37,420
>> But you also get plus
one when ever the student

13
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:40,140
gets something incorrect
that they should get right.

14
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:40,790
So, what does that mean?

15
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:44,680
So, if you say, well, this is where
their level of understanding is,

16
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:46,664
what you're really doing is you're
kind of picking two questions, right?

17
00:00:46,664 --> 00:00:49,930
You're you saying, look, this is a
question that they should get right and

18
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:51,680
this is a question
they should get wrong.

19
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,700
But if you actually identified where
their level of understanding is, then,

20
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:58,452
sometimes they'll get some of these
things wrong that they should get right

21
00:00:58,452 --> 00:00:59,650
because they're easier, and

22
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:02,110
sometimes they'll get right some of
the things that they should get wrong.

23
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:03,410
Sort of set up the problem that way.

24
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:03,930
>> Okay.
>> Right?

25
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:05,610
And I'm going to get credit for that.

26
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:06,230
>> You, the teacher.

27
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:09,110
>> You, the teacher, I'm the teacher,
going to get credit for that.

28
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:10,050
Well, let's see, what does that mean?

29
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:14,520
Well, that means, in order for
that to work, I must have identified,

30
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:18,385
more or less correctly, where your
level of understanding is as a learner.

31
00:01:18,385 --> 00:01:22,560
>> because if you set it too high,
the learner's always going to get things

32
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,310
wrong, but there are things that
the learner should get wrong, so

33
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:26,680
there's no points to the teacher.

34
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:31,420
And if the teacher sets it too easy,
the bar down towards the bottom,

35
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:33,840
then the learner's never
getting anything wrong.

36
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,050
And when he gets things right,

37
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:37,500
it's things that the learner
should get right.

38
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:40,680
And again, should just means
below the bar set by the teacher.

39
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,320
>> That's right.

40
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,270
So, you'll get some
points by doing that, but

41
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:46,700
you won't get as many as if you get
it right where they ought to be.

42
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:50,919
>> So, the maximum comes when you've
done this 50-50 thing, right,

43
00:01:50,919 --> 00:01:55,073
where you're getting points for
the learner stretching a little bit and

44
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:59,567
getting a little bit above and scoring
well, and you're getting points for,

45
00:01:59,567 --> 00:02:01,908
I guess tricking the student in a sense.

46
00:02:01,908 --> 00:02:05,121
>> [LAUGH] I wouldn't say tricking, what
you really is you're sort of testing

47
00:02:05,121 --> 00:02:07,163
where their understanding really is,
right?

48
00:02:07,163 --> 00:02:09,514
So, if it's the case that if
identified this correctly,

49
00:02:09,514 --> 00:02:12,443
will still get some things wrong,
we would think you would get right in,

50
00:02:12,443 --> 00:02:15,280
you'll get some things right that
we think you would get wrong.

51
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,938
You really want to do it on both sides.

52
00:02:16,938 --> 00:02:21,427
And so,
if I move this line too far to one side,

53
00:02:21,427 --> 00:02:25,355
I only get points for
one side of the bar.

54
00:02:25,355 --> 00:02:28,828
If I move things this far, all the way
over to the right, I only get points for

55
00:02:28,828 --> 00:02:30,052
the other side of the bar.

56
00:02:30,052 --> 00:02:31,605
I want to get things for
both sides of the bar.

57
00:02:31,605 --> 00:02:33,700
>> Mm-hm.
>> So, that's only going to happen,

58
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:37,540
if I can identify roughly where your
level of understanding actually is.

59
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:38,570
>> That's clever.

60
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:39,660
>> That is kind of clever.

61
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:40,760
>> Did you come up with this?

62
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:45,100
>> I came up with this by listening to a
guy named Jordan when he told me this is

63
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:49,280
what he ended up doing with real
class of, I think, fifth graders.

64
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,040
>> Interesting.

65
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,620
>> Now, by the way,
there's something subtle here,

66
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:52,910
we actually aren't finished with this.

67
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:55,500
We just described this as
if it only happens once.

68
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,290
Really, what we did is we spend our
time talking about the teacher, and that

69
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:02,250
makes sense, because the teacher is this
complicated incentive function, right?

70
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:04,018
So, the teacher's
going to get credit for

71
00:03:04,018 --> 00:03:06,780
basically identifying where
your level of understanding is.

72
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:09,850
So, let's say I've done that, I know
where your level of understanding is.

73
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:10,810
I put the line here.

74
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:11,740
>> Good.

75
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:15,260
>> What should you, what it's
going to happen for you as a learner.

76
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:17,470
Your goal is still to
maximize your points.

77
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:19,110
So, how do you maximize your points?

78
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:21,350
>> Well, learner's perspective,
just try to always answer correctly.

79
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:21,850
>> Right.

80
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:25,670
So, how are you going to start answering
things correctly, getting more and

81
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:27,140
more things right?

82
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:27,950
>> By learning?

83
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:32,050
>> By learning, by actually moving
your actual bar to the right.

84
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:32,610
>> I see.

85
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:35,300
>> Because then, you will not
get these things wrong anymore,

86
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:37,450
and you will get these things right.

87
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:40,290
And so, you will increase
the number of points that you get.

88
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:40,970
>> Got it.
>> So

89
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:46,250
then, this will cause you to learn more
so that you can get more things right.

90
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:48,055
And then,
what's going to happen to the teacher?

91
00:03:48,055 --> 00:03:49,780
>> Teacher's going to be unhappy, but

92
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:51,760
the teacher could move
the bar to the right.

93
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,832
>> Right.

94
00:03:52,832 --> 00:03:54,920
>> To kind of catch up to
where you actually are.

95
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:58,160
>> Right, so the learner is
incentivized to learn, and the teacher

96
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:02,240
is incentivized to understand really
what the learner has learned.

97
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:06,070
And they will keep pushing each other
until you've learned everything.

98
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:08,750
>> Ooh, and then,
no one has any incentives anymore.

99
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:09,863
>> Yeah, but at that point,
you know everything.

100
00:04:09,863 --> 00:04:11,926
And you're a teenager.

101
00:04:11,926 --> 00:04:16,110
>> [LAUGH] Well, I was just
worried about this case where, so

102
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:19,360
then the learner feigns ignorance for
a little while so the teacher can

103
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:23,320
move the bar down, and then, starts
getting things right and wrong again.

104
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,340
Yeah, I don't know,
I guess that's not really a concern.

105
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:26,250
>> Yeah, I don't think so.

106
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:27,500
>> Okay.
>> And even if it is,

107
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,040
the teacher will immediately
figure this out, and

108
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,690
the learner will be giving
up points in the meantime.

109
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:34,100
>> Yeah.
>> It's not really the maximal policy.

110
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:37,180
I mean you'd have to
get it exactly right.

111
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:37,770
>> Right.

112
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:39,530
It's just that once the learners
learned everything,

113
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:41,030
the teacher has no incentive anymore.

114
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:43,260
>> Sure, but then once the learners
learn everything, then you're done.
