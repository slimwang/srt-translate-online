Here's a quick follow-up question
about the SUMMA algorithm.

2
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:05,170
Compared to the 1-D scheme,

3
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:10,480
does SUMMA require more memory, the same
amount of memory, or less memory?

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,160
By way of reminder, remember
the 1-D scheme's memory requirement

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,110
was basically 4 n squared over P.

6
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:20,520
You'll remember that came from having to
store a piece of A, a piece of B, and

7
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,930
a piece of C as well as
an extra buffer for messaging.

8
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:26,370
Now, if you think the answer
depends on something,

9
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:29,280
you can check more than one of
the options that you think are possible.
