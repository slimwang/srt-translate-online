1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:02,719
And you know you'll need to provide multiple copies of

2
00:00:02,719 --> 00:00:06,370
this image, so low pixel count devices can save bandwidth

3
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:10,100
or high pixel count devices can get a crisp image.

4
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:12,260
It's possible to do this on the server side in some

5
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:16,379
cases. In fact, some content systems let you simply specify

6
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:19,180
what size you want a given source image app And they

7
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:21,550
deal with the trans coding on the server end including

8
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:25,400
caching. If you want the images to actually represent different art,

9
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,510
different crops for example you'll have to do

10
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:30,400
that manually. For each of these images though you

11
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,310
should remember to tune the quality parameters to

12
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:37,060
minimize file size while maximizing quality. You'll need at

13
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:39,830
least 1x and 2x versions of your images

14
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:44,260
although 1.3x and 3x are fairly common too now.

15
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:46,840
Again, note that although I'm speaking of this as

16
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:50,530
1x or 2x, for purposes of device pixel ratio,

17
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:53,960
for responsive images, you may request different images based

18
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:56,630
on available layout width. You may even want to

19
00:00:56,630 --> 00:01:00,450
change the image itself. For example, in Landscape mode,

20
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:02,770
I may want to crop the picture completely differently.
