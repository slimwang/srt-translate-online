1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,379
However, I noticed we could have
stopped our search earlier.

2
00:00:03,379 --> 00:00:04,400
>> How?

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,839
>> At this step,
we said the northern territory and

4
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:09,279
South Australia, both had to be blue.

5
00:00:09,279 --> 00:00:10,000
>> So?

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,968
>> But these two regions are adjacent,
we know they can't both be blue.

7
00:00:13,968 --> 00:00:17,629
>> I see, forward checking propagates
information from assigned to unassigned

8
00:00:17,629 --> 00:00:20,939
variables, but doesn't provide
early detection for all failures.

9
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:24,020
Instead we can use constraint
propagation repeatedly to enforce all

10
00:00:24,019 --> 00:00:25,649
the local constraints.

11
00:00:25,649 --> 00:00:29,729
We can use arc consistency for a simple
version of constraint propagation.

12
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:33,579
A variable in a constraint satisfaction
problem is arc consistent with respect

13
00:00:33,579 --> 00:00:37,049
to another variable if there is
some value still available for

14
00:00:37,049 --> 00:00:40,320
the second variable after we assign
a value to the first variable.

15
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,090
If all variables in the graph
satisfy this condition,

16
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:45,520
then the network is arc consistent.

17
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,490
>> Let's look at a practical example.

18
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:50,289
Once we get to the stage of
assigning green to Queensland,

19
00:00:50,289 --> 00:00:52,269
we look at all of its
neighbors that are unassigned.

20
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:54,890
And see if the assignment of green
reduces the number of colors

21
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:56,070
available to them.

22
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:58,210
If so, we remove that color
from the neighboring region.

23
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:00,939
And then look at its neighboring
regions to see if we need to propagate

24
00:01:00,939 --> 00:01:02,119
the change onward.

25
00:01:02,119 --> 00:01:04,299
We keep doing this process
until it terminates or

26
00:01:04,299 --> 00:01:07,369
we determine that one of the regions
does not have any colors left.

27
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:10,650
>> So, here we have removed green
from South Australia's list, and

28
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:12,290
are now looking at its neighbors.

29
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:16,160
New South Wales is a neighbor, and
in order to be arc consistent we

30
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:19,379
will have to remove blue
from its available colors.

31
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:21,119
It can only be orange.

32
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,150
>> Victoria is a neighbor
of New South Wales, so

33
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:25,120
we look to see if the change affects it.

34
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,490
In fact, it does.

35
00:01:26,489 --> 00:01:29,679
We remove orange from Victoria's
list of available colors.

36
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,560
Our choice of green for

37
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,629
Queensland has caused a chain of changes
in possible values for our variables.

38
00:01:34,629 --> 00:01:36,729
>> Why don't we remove
blue while we're at it, so

39
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:39,329
Victoria doesn't conflict
with South Australia.

40
00:01:39,329 --> 00:01:42,530
>> Well, we haven't gotten that far
in our queue of things to check yet.

41
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:45,079
Next we're going to look at the Northern
territory because they're just another

42
00:01:45,079 --> 00:01:48,310
neighbor that might be affected
by South Australia's change.

43
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:50,939
In fact we see South Australia and
the Northern territory are both

44
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:54,170
restricted to blue which is not allowed,
so we return a failure and

45
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:57,159
force a search to try another option for
Queensland.

46
00:01:57,159 --> 00:01:58,939
>> Wow, that was a lot of work.

47
00:01:58,939 --> 00:02:01,159
>> But it can save a lot of
unnecessary deep searching for

48
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:02,509
more complicated problems.
