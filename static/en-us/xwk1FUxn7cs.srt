1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:04,786
The answer to all three of these questions is no. The only factor common to all

2
00:00:04,786 --> 00:00:09,284
three terms is 1. We also know that we can't use a factoring pattern to factor

3
00:00:09,284 --> 00:00:13,510
this side of the equation. 6 is not a perfect square, so this doesn't fit the

4
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:17,937
pattern for a perfect square trinomial, or for the difference of two squares.

5
00:00:17,938 --> 00:00:22,430
And finally, we need four terms to do factoring by grouping so this won't work

6
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:22,974
either.
