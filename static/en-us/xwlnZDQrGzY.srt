00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:03,330
Hi I'm Gabriele and
I'll be your instructor for

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:05,800
this short introduction to Objective-C.

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:08,360
This course is tailored for
Swift developers.

4
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:12,890
Our goal is to prepare you to dive into
an unfamiliar Objective-C code base and

5
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:15,620
migrate features from
Objective C to Swift.

6
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:17,530
We'll be focusing on
the following skills.

7
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:19,700

8
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:23,800
In lesson one you'll learn
the distinguishing language features

9
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:24,830
of Objective C.

10
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:28,280
In lesson two we'll go over
some Objective C syntax and

11
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:30,600
you'll write some classes and
properties from scratch.

12
00:00:32,229 --> 00:00:35,810
In lesson 3, we'll talk about how
to write and call methods, a.k.a.

13
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:37,980
send messages in Objective-C.

14
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:41,680
With these new skills you'll
build a functioning game.

15
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:46,230
In lesson 4, you'll port the app
GIF Maker from Objective-C to Swift,

16
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:49,840
focusing on writing custom classes and
incorporating third party frameworks and

17
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,913
extensions and lesson 5,

18
00:00:51,913 --> 00:00:56,430
you'll import more features of GIF
maker from Objective C to Swift

19
00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:00,918
focusing on data persistence
with NSCoder and I NSK.driver.

20
00:01:00,918 --> 00:01:04,694
To wrap things up in less than six,
we'll review the most common challenges

21
00:01:04,694 --> 00:01:08,296
for interoperability between
the languages of iOS and you'll complete

22
00:01:08,296 --> 00:01:11,381
a set of coding challenges to
sharpen your interrupt skills.

23
00:01:11,381 --> 00:01:16,639
