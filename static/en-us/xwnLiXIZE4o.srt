1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
And this concept here of taking an input and

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
transforming it in polynomial time

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
into a new input for another problem

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
so that you get the same solution is known as a polynomial time reduction.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
And if you want to be precise about what you're applying this reduction to,

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
you can say that you have a polynomial time reduction from X to Y,

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
so in other words, you can take a problem X

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
and show that problem Y is powerful enough to solve problem X.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
So in order to help you wrap your head

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
a little bit more around polynomial time reductions,

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
we'll do a little quiz here.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
So I would like you to think about if we

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
manage to reduce a problem X to another problem Y, what does that imply?

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
And I'm going to give you 4 choices here,

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
and I know it's easy to guess which one of those are correct,

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
but you should really give this some thought first

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
to make sure that you understand the concept of reductions

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
because this is going to play a very important role

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
in this unit and also in the next units.

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
So I'll give you 4 choices here.

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Does reducing a problem X to a problem Y imply that:

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
X is at least as hard to solve as Y,

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
and by hardness, I mean the distinction

24
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
between polynomial time and exponential time.

25
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
So in this case here for example,

26
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
if Y is only solvable in exponential time,

27
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
does that mean that X can only be solved in exponential time as well

28
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
or is it other way around?

29
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Does it imply that Y is at least as hard to solve as X?

30
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Does it mean that if X can be solved for the polynomial time, then so can Y

31
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
or does it mean that if Y can be solved for the polynimial time, then so can X?

32
00:01:35,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So please check all of the answers here that are correct.
