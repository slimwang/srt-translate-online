00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,710
Changes on your screens based on the
feedback you've received is fairly easy.

2
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:08,570
You can quickly draw new versions of
your screens using paper and pen, or

3
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:10,750
use a design tool you feel
most comfortable with.

4
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:16,470
Once you've edited your screens and
saved them as JPEGs, PNGs or GIFs,

5
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:20,280
simply upload the screens to Envision
once again to replace your screens.

6
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:25,240
Or, if you're using Envision's sync
tool, simply save your screens with

7
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:29,950
the same file names as you had before
in the screens folder of your project.

8
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:33,820
Envision will automatically handle the
version control of your screens for you.
