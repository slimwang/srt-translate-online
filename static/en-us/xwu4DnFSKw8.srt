1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,452
As we move from the point 1,7 to the point 5,3, our x-coordinate moves to the

2
00:00:05,464 --> 00:00:10,651
right, 1, 2, 3, 4. This is the positive direction so we can say that our

3
00:00:10,663 --> 00:00:16,071
increase in x is positive 4. Now y, on the other hand, as we move from here to

4
00:00:16,082 --> 00:00:21,427
here, has to step down, 1, 2, 3, 4. So, we actually have a decrease of 4 and y.

5
00:00:21,672 --> 00:00:27,781
A decrease is the same as a negative increase. So, our increase in y is negative

6
00:00:27,793 --> 00:00:33,799
4. We know the slope is just the increase in y divided by the increase in x, so

7
00:00:33,811 --> 00:00:37,278
our slope is negative 4 over 4 or negative 1.
