00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,580
Let's do a quiz now.

2
00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:05,400
Let's take a look at what happens when threads contend for a mutex.

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:08,290
For this quiz, we will use the following diagram.

4
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:13,950
We have five threads, T1 through T5, who want access to a shared resource,

5
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:18,810
and the mutex m is used to ensure mutual exclusion to that resource.

6
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:23,860
T1 is the first one to get access to the mutex and the dotted line corresponds

7
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:29,620
to the time when T1 finishes the execution of the critical section and frees m.

8
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:34,390
The time when the remaining threads issue their mutex requests correspond to

9
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:38,500
the lock(m) positions along this time axis.

10
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:43,390
For the remaining threads, which thread will be the one to get access to

11
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:46,860
the mutex after T1 releases control?

12
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:52,190
Your choices are T2, T3, T4, and T5, and you should mark all that apply.
