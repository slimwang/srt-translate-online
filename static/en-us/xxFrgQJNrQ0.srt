00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:02,880
So the first type of bot activity,

00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:13,010
Or used to gather valuable
financial information?

6
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:16,730
Or infect machines to send

00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:17,590
It is obviously C.

00:00:22,779 --> 00:00:23,356
Is it A,

11
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:28,690
used by botmasters to fraudulently
increase revenue from advertisers?

12
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:34,190
Yes, a Click Fraud bot can click
on ads specified by the botmaster,

13
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:37,550
as if the clicks were from
the real human users.

14
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:42,340

increase revenue from the advertisers.

from the user.

19
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:54,750
For example,
a bot net running a phishing campaign

20
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:58,120
can trick a user to enter
personal information or

21
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:03,290
financial data into a web server that's
controlled by the bot master because

22
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:07,300
the users were tricked to believe
that the server was a bank server.
