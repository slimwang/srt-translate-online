1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Let's study the first case.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
We saw left feature number 1.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
The left one is over here, therefore this one will be feature number 1.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Feature number 1 will be seen at the center of camera B.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
In the center of the left camera, we see feature number 2,

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
which must be this guy over here, because it's the center feature to be seen.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
This will be projected to the right side of camera B.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Even though it's left in the image plane, the way a I drew it you can see that

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
the projection over here is on the right side of the camera chip.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The same with feature number 3, which is seen in R over here on the right side.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Hence, it'll project into the leftmost field over here.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Using a different color now, if camera B sees feature number 1 on its L position,

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Then this must be feature number one, which will appear on the right position for camera A.

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
And feature number 2 is in the center position--this guy over here--

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
which shows up in the left position over here,

16
00:00:52,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and the remaining fits in over here. This is the correct answer.
