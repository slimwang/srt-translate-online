1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,370
So the last thing we need to implement
is the onSignedOut function,

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:06,640
you might remember we called that a
little earlier, which is pretty simple.

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,420
All it does is that it enables
the sign-in button and

4
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:12,330
then disables the sign-out and
revoke buttons.

5
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:13,930
Go ahead and
implement this function now and

6
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:15,390
then check this box when you are done.
