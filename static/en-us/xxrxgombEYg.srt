1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:01,886
So far as each one of these

2
00:00:01,886 --> 00:00:05,534
operating systems is concerned, in their native form,

3
00:00:05,534 --> 00:00:08,802
when they think about physical memory, they think

4
00:00:08,802 --> 00:00:12,957
of physical memory as contiguous. But, unfortunately, the

5
00:00:12,957 --> 00:00:15,769
real physical memory, we're going to call it

6
00:00:15,769 --> 00:00:18,125
machine memory from now on, is in the

7
00:00:18,125 --> 00:00:21,870
control of the hypervisor. Not in the control

8
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:25,450
of any one operating system. So, the physical

9
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:30,420
memory of each of these operating systems is itself an

10
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:35,470
illusion. It's no longer contiguous in terms of the

11
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:40,950
real machine memory that the hypervisor controls. So for instance,

12
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:45,820
if you look at the physical memory that windows has, I've broken that down

13
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:50,760
into 2 regions, R1 and R2. And R1 has let's say a number

14
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:56,855
of pages 0 through Q, and R2 has a number of pages starting from Q plus 1,

15
00:00:56,855 --> 00:01:02,550
through N. So this is a physical memory. But if you look at this region R1, it's

16
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:05,110
occupying a space in the machine memory, the

17
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:08,400
real physical memory, which we call the machine memory,

18
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,130
controlled by the hypervisor over here. R2 is not

19
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:15,630
contiguous with respect to R1 in the machine memory.

20
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:20,700
It's been put over here. And come over to this guy, Lennox, and

21
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:25,740
it has its own physical memory, and we'll call that, region 1 and region 2

22
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:31,220
again. And it has a total capacity of. M +

23
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:36,210
1 physical page frames, all of which, zero through

24
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:41,580
L are contiguous in the machine memory. L+1 through M

25
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:45,770
are contiguous in machine memory, but, they're not contiguous with respect to

26
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:50,810
the other region R1. Why would this happen? The hyperwaves is not being

27
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:56,410
nasty to the operating system. After all. Even if all of the N

28
00:01:56,410 --> 00:02:01,640
plus 1 pages of Windows, and N plus 1 pages

29
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:07,040
of Linux would be contiguous in the machine memory, they cannot

30
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,580
all start at 0 because the physical

31
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:12,580
memory, the real physical memory, which we're

32
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:17,450
calling machine memory, is the only thing that is contiguous. And that has to be

33
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:20,630
partitioned between these two guys, and therefore,

34
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:24,480
the starting point for the physical memory, the

35
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,320
illusion of the physical memory, so far

36
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:32,250
as a particular operating system, cannot be 0.

37
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:35,710
Also, the memory requirements of operating systems are

38
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:39,860
dynamic, and bursting. When Windows started out initially

39
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:42,740
with Q plus 1 pages, and later on

40
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:46,570
it needed additional memory, then it's going to request the

41
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:49,020
hypervisor and at that point, it may not

42
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:51,600
be possible for the hypervisor to give another

43
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,880
region, which is contiguous with the previous region

44
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:57,560
that Windows already has. So these are the reasons

45
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:03,510
why the physical memory of an operating system, it still becomes

46
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:09,480
an illusion, in terms of how it is actually contained in the machine memory.
