Thanks Kyle. Let's use the day object to do another calculation. If you haven't

2
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:07,693
already booted up BlueJ, you should do it now and open up the days project.

3
00:00:07,693 --> 00:00:14,880
Mariner4 launched November 28, 1964. It took 228 days to arrive on Mars. What

4
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,430
was its arrival date? Before you do this, I want to show you one more thing

5
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:25,470
that you can do with objects. I've opened up the days project in BlueJ. I can

6
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:33,280
make a day object and now I can quickly see exactly the day that's in here

7
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,010
using the two string method. I won't actually do it, because I want you to be

8
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:41,000
able to do this yourself. And try it. But that should make it much quicker. So

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,615
here are some hints. Use a day object to do the calculation And use the

10
00:00:44,615 --> 00:00:47,930
toString method to read the day. Make sure that when you write the arrival

11
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:51,000
date, you use the same format that the toString method uses. And don't worry

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,170
too much if you don't have BlueJ working yet. You can just skip to the answer

13
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:56,670
video and watch it carefully. There will be more examples you can do soon.
