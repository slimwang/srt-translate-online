00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,340
Let's look at the solution
to our LRU quiz.

2
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:08,550
We had this situation in the cache and
these counters before these accesses.

3
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:12,250
And now we're performing accesses to A,
B, A, D, and K.

4
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:15,390
A is the most recently used block.

5
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:18,520
We reaccess it,
none of the counters change.

6
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:22,680
We access B,
Bs counter becomes seven from three.

7
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:26,730
That means that all the counters
above three will be decremented.

8
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:28,500
Two stays the same.

9
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,110
One stays the same.

10
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:31,680
Zero stays the same.

11
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:34,570
So these are the new
counters after Bs access.

12
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:39,800
Next, we access A again,
this counter becomes 7.

13
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:43,540
All the counters above
6 are decremented, so

14
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:45,610
this is really the only change.

15
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:49,790
Now D is accessed,
this counter becomes 7.

16
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:52,810
Those above 5 are decremented.

17
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:54,680
The remaining ones stay the same.

18
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,238
All of these have been hit so far so

19
00:00:56,238 --> 00:00:59,810
nothing has changed in the cache we
still have exactly the same stuff there.

20
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:05,670
The only change will be when
we access K which is in this.

21
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:08,920
So now we need to choose who goes out.

22
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:12,250
And the one that goes out is
the one whose counter is zero.

23
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:14,750
So H is replaced by K.

24
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:18,960
The other blocks are remain
the same as they were and

25
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,850
this is the final answer for this quiz.
