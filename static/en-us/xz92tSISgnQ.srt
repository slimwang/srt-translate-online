What major issue is Scalability. If you've got an interesting application,

2
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:10,290
that's distributed across the internet, it might grow. That is, it might,

3
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:15,265
have more users over time. Or it might have, a greater load,

4
00:00:15,265 --> 00:00:19,390
due to the individual users. In either case,

5
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:23,670
you want to be able to grow the application. And the question then is,

6
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:28,240
how easy is it to grow? This is sometimes called scaling. That is,

7
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:32,940
how easy is it to scale your application? Scaling typically takes the form of

8
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:37,050
adding new hardware. And the question then becomes, to what extent will

9
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:43,370
adding new machines change your system architecture, or its components? Ideally,

10
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:48,440
we'd like to grow transparently. What transparency means is, whether or

11
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:53,240
not a particular aspect of a systems architecture is visible externally,

12
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:58,140
that is, to the, the other machines. If it's invisible, of course, you can

13
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:01,530
scale as much as you want, and the rest of the system would not be concerned.
