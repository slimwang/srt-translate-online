1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,250
So that ties together this, what constructed E does

2
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:06,920
for you, and connecting it to the hardest examples.

3
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:08,800
So now, that gets us to a nice little

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,980
trick where we can talk about how we actually output

5
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:15,650
our final example. So, the way you construct your

6
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:17,930
final example, they way you do that combination in the

7
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:20,920
step is basically by doing a weighted average. And

8
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:25,330
the weight Is going to be based upon this alpha

9
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:34,370
sub T. So the final hypothesis is just the s g n function of the weighted sum of

10
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:38,750
all of the rules of thumb, all of the weak classifiers that you've been picking

11
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:40,990
up over all of these time steps Where

12
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:44,230
they're weighted by the alpha sub T's. And remember,

13
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:50,540
the alpha sub T is one half of the natural log of one minus epsilon T over

14
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:54,250
epsilon T. That is to say, it's a measure of how

15
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:58,240
well you're doing with respect to underlining error. So, you get more

16
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:01,670
weight if you do well Then if you do less well or

17
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:04,010
you get less weight. So what does this look like to you?

18
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:06,680
Well its a weighted average based on how well you're doing or

19
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:09,870
how well each of the individual hypotheses are doing and then you

20
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:12,770
pass it through a thresh holding function where if its below zero

21
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:15,600
you say you know what? Negative and if its above zero you

22
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,380
say you know what? Positive and if its zero you just throw

23
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:21,860
up your hands and And return zero. In other words, you return literally

24
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:25,750
the sign of the number. So you are throwing away information there, and

25
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:28,710
I'm not going to tell you what it is now, but when we go

26
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:31,280
to the next lesson it;s going to turn out that that little bit of

27
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,640
information you throw away is actually

28
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,210
pretty important. But that's just a little

29
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:37,370
bit of a teaser. We'll get back to that there. Okay so, this

30
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:40,720
is boosting, Michael. There's really nothing else to it. You have a very

31
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,360
simple algorithm, which can be written down in a couple

32
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,640
of lines. The hardest parts are constructing the distribution, which I

33
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,330
show you how to do over here, and then simply bringing

34
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:52,600
everything together, which I show you how to do over here.

35
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,320
>> Alright yeah, I think it doesn't seem so bad

36
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,810
and I feel like I could code this up, but I

37
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:58,510
would be a little happier if I had a handle

38
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:00,870
on what the, why alpha is the way that it is.

39
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:03,200
>> Well there's two answers. The first answer

40
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,180
is. You use natural logs because you're using

41
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:08,210
exponentials and that's always a cute thing to

42
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:10,600
do. And of course, you're using the error term

43
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,400
as a way of measuring how good the hypothesis

44
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,680
is. And the second answer is, it's in the

45
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:17,658
reading you were supposed to have done. [LAUGH] So,

46
00:02:17,658 --> 00:02:19,478
go back and read the paper now that you've

47
00:02:19,478 --> 00:02:21,194
listened to this and you will have a much

48
00:02:21,194 --> 00:02:24,300
better understanding of what it's trying to tell you.

49
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:24,550
>> Thanks

50
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:27,100
>> You're welcome. I'm about helping others Michael you know that.
