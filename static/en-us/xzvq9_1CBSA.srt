1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
We use this equation to describe the conduction of heat along the wire

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
and over in a position to put some mathematical meaning to it.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
As time goes on, the value of the temperature changes

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
by the length of the time step times this expression.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
So this expression has to be the rate of change of the temperature with respect to time.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Ṫ₈ if you will at times 0.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Of course, we're always dealing with estimates here even though I'm writing an equal sign.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
But now that we know about central-difference formulas,

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
we have another interpretation of the term.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
It's 1 mm squared delta x squared times the second derivative of our temperature.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Of course, I'm again cheating a little here.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
We only know the temperatures of the different compartments.

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
We don't have any curve of which we could form the second derivative.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Now, we're going to write this equation in a professional fashion. Let's do this right.

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Temperature depends both on space and time.

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,000
It changes along the wire that is both position, and it changes with time. We see temporal evolution.

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
What we need here is the rate of change with respect to time and the way to be writing this is this.

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
It's called the partial derivative of the temperature with respect to time.

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
It's not written with lower case letter d but with curly type of d.

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:20,000
This derivative of the temperature with respect to time equals 10 over 1 second times 1 mm².

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:28,000
And this one is the second partial derivative of temperature with respect to position written like this

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Note how this is being written.

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The curly d is squared not the complete expression in the numerator.

24
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Even though in the denominator, everything is being squared.

25
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
They're going to discuss partial derivatives in the next segments so bare with me.

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
This equation is called the heat equation.

27
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
In this case, it describes the conduction of heat along the wire along one dimension,

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
and it's a partial differential equation.

29
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
PDE is the technical term. It contains partial derivatives.

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:03,000
That's why the differential equations we have seen so far are ordinary differential equations, ODEs.

31
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,000
PDEs, partial differential equations, are typical for problems in space or problems in space and time.

32
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:16,000
The constant involved here is often called alpha the thermal diffusivity.

33
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
The name already hints at this being a diffuse equation.

34
00:02:20,000 --> 99:59:59,999
The heat diffuses along the wire.
