1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:02,440
Now that we're selecting
a random page number,

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:06,470
we need to make a second request,
get a random image from that page.

3
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:08,850
This request is going to look
a lot like our first request, but

4
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:11,540
just have that added page parameter.

5
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:14,350
So let's reuse some of our existing
code to create a new method called

6
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:19,220
displayImageFromFlickerbySearch that
takes the method parameters again, but

7
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:21,780
an additional parameter
called withPageNumber.

8
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:25,860
Now most of the code in this method
is going to be the same as when we

9
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:29,280
made our first request, so
while I normally don't recommend this,

10
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:32,450
I'll start by copying and pasting
over the code from our first request.

11
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:36,290
Gone ahead and copied it and
we'll paste it there.

12
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:43,280
And then, let's back this up to here.

13
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:47,020
Let me finish parsing the data.

14
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:47,910
So all that's the same.

15
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:52,710
Let's collapse this and
reopen our, oops.

16
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:56,370
Reopen our other one.

17
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:57,860
There we go.

18
00:00:57,860 --> 00:00:58,980
There's our random page number.

19
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:03,490
Now there are definitely more
elegant ways to do this and

20
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:06,110
to avoid this duplication
of similar code,

21
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:09,500
but we're going to get to
them later in this course.

22
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:10,920
So let's go ahead and call this method.

23
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:16,300
There we go and
we can reuse our method parameters.

24
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:19,170
And then we'll use our
random page number.

25
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,910
Now with this method, we need to add the
page parameter to the method parameters

26
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:27,460
before we create our URL.

27
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:31,430
One quick way to do this, is to make the
method parameters a variable parameter,

28
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:34,060
so that we can modify it
in the body of this method.

29
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:41,680
So let's do that and then let's add
the page parameter to the dictionary.

30
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:46,000
Now the rest of the code in this
completion handler should be fine

31
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,320
up until the point where we
need to parse the result.

32
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:52,280
Remember, we need to get
the array of photo dictionaries,

33
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:55,460
select a random photo dictionary,
grab it's URL and

34
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:57,280
title, and
then display those to the user.

35
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:02,630
I've gone ahead and copied the code that
we'll need, and I've pasted it here now.

36
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:06,560
Now, don't be alarmed, you've seen
this code already where you checked

37
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,941
the status to make sure it's okay,
then we get the photos dictionary, and

38
00:02:10,941 --> 00:02:16,075
then we get the array of our
individual photo dictionaries, and

39
00:02:16,075 --> 00:02:20,285
then we make sure that we at least
have have one photo in the array and

40
00:02:20,285 --> 00:02:24,715
we randomly generate our photo index,
or the index I should say for

41
00:02:24,715 --> 00:02:26,015
the photo dictionary that we need.

42
00:02:27,145 --> 00:02:31,670
Select our photo dictionary,
get its title, and

43
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:36,210
also get the url_m,
the url that we need for the image,

44
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:42,000
and then with all that in place we use
our perform ui updates on main and

45
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,460
we make our changes to the ui.

46
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:49,430
I've also added a little extra code
that displays untitled if we somehow

47
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:52,450
select an image without a title,
I think this has happened to me once.

48
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:54,799
That's it, let's run this.

49
00:03:00,245 --> 00:03:05,410
I'll use the search term baseball and
it looks like it works.

50
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:08,578
For good measure, let's do a latitude
and longitude search as well.

51
00:03:19,863 --> 00:03:26,210
I'll use the latitude 37.86,
and the longitude -119.53,

52
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:31,649
and these are the coordinates for
the Yosemite National Park.

53
00:03:31,649 --> 00:03:33,220
And there we go, this looks great.

54
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:37,440
Now I want you to follow the steps I
just showed to complete Flick Finder by

55
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,620
selecting a random image
from a random page.

56
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:42,060
When you are done, check this box.
