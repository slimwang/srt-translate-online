>> So like you said, our precondition for the first one,

2
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:07,640
is that both x and y are clear. We can't move x if there's anything on top of x,

3
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:12,154
and we can't put it on y if something is already on top of y. Our post

4
00:00:12,154 --> 00:00:15,839
condition then, is that x is on y. For the table it's a little bit easier,

5
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:19,850
the table has unlimited room. So for the table, as long as X is clear we

6
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:23,720
can move X to the table. And in the postcondition is that X is now on the table.
