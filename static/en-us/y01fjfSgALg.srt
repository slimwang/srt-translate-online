1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
We're going to start by picking a random d that has to be relatively prime to φ(n).

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
We can pick random numbers and test that this property holds and pick again if it doesn't.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Since d is relatively prime to the totient of n,

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
that means it has a multiplicative inverse in that group.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:25,000
So we can find some value e such that d is equal to 1 mod φ(n).

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:32,000
There exists some value e such that de is congruent to 1 mod φ(n).

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Now the question is given d and the totient of n

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
is it hard to compute e?

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
The choices are, yes, it'd better be hard. Otherwise RSA would be insecure.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
No, it's easy. We can use the extended Euclidean algorithm to do this.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Or three--no, it's easy. We can just divide the φ(n) by d.
