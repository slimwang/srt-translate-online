00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:03,250
That was a good incremental step. Now, let's add back the parts

2
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:06,370
that make this into a real credit card verifying program. I'm going to

3
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:09,030
ask you to write one more Java program. And this time, I'd

4
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:12,110
like you to use this pseudocode. There's a tester program you can use

5
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:15,250
for guidance. And here's a hint. Credit card numbers are too big

6
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:18,090
for ints. This problem is tricky. There are a lot of ways

7
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:21,130
to write code that almost works, but not quite. It will be

8
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:22,340
very important to use the tester

9
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:25,500
program. You can also use System.out.println statements

10
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,150
to get an idea of what your program is doing. There will be more

11
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:31,140
hint videos. Try to use the ones that match the questions in your mind.
