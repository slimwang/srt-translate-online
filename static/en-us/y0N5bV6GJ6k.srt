The Blinn-Phone reflection model looks pretty good. It's been used for well

2
00:00:03,453 --> 00:00:07,096
over 30 years, because it's fairly flexible and quick to compute. On fixed

3
00:00:07,096 --> 00:00:10,120
function graphics hardware, where you could not program the shaders, this

4
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:14,580
reflection model was the one locked into transistors and could not be changed.

00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:17,226
Back then you could simulate other reflection models by verious tricks and

6
00:00:17,226 --> 00:00:19,872
setting a large number of switches on the chip, but for the most part you were

00:00:19,872 --> 00:00:23,100
stuck with what was burnt into the transistors.
