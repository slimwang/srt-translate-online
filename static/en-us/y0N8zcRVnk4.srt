00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:26,240
>> Okay, so it is another well-founded induction because we've

2
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:31,750
shrunk the lengths of the things that we're comparing recursively. in,

3
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:37,110
in logic this would look like x is the value at

4
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:42,600
position 1 of x does not equal the value in position 1 in y,

5
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:47,540
that's our condition here and there, what we had before about the position x so

6
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:51,900
there existed j. j is greater than one, j is less than the length of y

7
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:57,240
where x of 1 equals y of j and it must be the case that

8
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:01,900
there's a permutation between the tail of x. Leaving out the first element and

9
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:07,560
the results of pasting together y from 1 up to j minus 1 with the result,

10
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:13,770
with the the third segment which was from j plus 1 through the end of, end of y.

11
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:19,130
And the little funny symbol with, looks like a cap hair is pasting together and

12
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:23,460
the real name for that is concatenation. We can concatenate two vectors together

13
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:27,400
using this operator and if those conditions all hold then we'll,

14
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:31,150
then what we're defining x to be a permutation of y.
