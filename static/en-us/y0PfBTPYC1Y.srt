1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:04,721
The solutions for this equation were 2 plus or minus i. Great work if you found

2
00:00:04,721 --> 00:00:09,510
these. We start by identifying the variables or the coefficients, a, b, and c.

3
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:15,574
a equals positive 1, b equals negative 4, and c equals positive 5. We plug

4
00:00:15,574 --> 00:00:18,760
these into our quadratic formula using parentheses around each of the

5
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:24,030
variables. Here, we'll have the negative of negative 4, which is positive 4.

6
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:27,932
Here, we'll have negative 4 squared, which is 16. And these three factors will

7
00:00:27,932 --> 00:00:32,580
give us a product of negative 20. Our denominator will be 2 from this product.

8
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:36,504
And then, we simplify our radical to get the square root of negative 4. The

9
00:00:36,504 --> 00:00:41,200
square root of negative 4 is 2i, and then we can factor a 2 from our numerator.

10
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,762
So we can simplify one last time. 2 divided by 2 equals 1, and we're left with

11
00:00:45,762 --> 00:00:47,650
2 plus or minus i.
