1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Now that's really cool which means for any coin flip in any sample size,

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
you can compute for me how confident you are.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:17,000
If in the coin flip, you came back to saying, wow I believe it's the 0.44,

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
you can now say, well, given the number of same as the head, it's not 0.44. It's a confidence interval.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:29,000
It's a certain way of maybe Â±0.07 that gets added to the 0.44

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
that they can be confident about according to our method study so far.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
In practice, in which you were given a sample and you don't know the exact value of p.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Suppose this is the sample you observed, N=4 and we're going to apply the formula

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:51,000
even though we understand it should only apply when N is equal or larger than 30.

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Just for the exercise of applying the formula, compute for me the mean and the variance.

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The variance, I don't need the formula variance but the variance,

12
00:01:02,000 --> 99:59:59,999
I mean the actual variance from the data sequence.
