00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:04,380
We seemed to have arrived at the moment
of truth for our entrepreneurs.

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:05,610
They've gotta pick a model to implement.

3
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:07,330
Do you have any suggestions, Ito?

4
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:08,290
>> Sure.

5
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:11,460
In many cases,
the choice is pretty clear.

6
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:14,360
For example,
most games are using a framing model and

7
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:16,640
such, generally using subscriptions.

8
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,150
Both benefits from the trust
they created with their users.

9
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:23,020
However, there is no
replacement to keep trying and

10
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:26,020
tuning the models that
fit your special needs.

11
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:28,710
There are rare cases where
you have enough funding and

12
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:30,740
you wish to focus on growth.

13
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:34,000
It's totally fine, since the value
of your company is composed

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,220
from the current revenue stream and
the future one.

15
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:40,360
>> Let's also hear from some other
startups to get their advise on

16
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:41,830
choosing a monetization strategy.
