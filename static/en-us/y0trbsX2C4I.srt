00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:04,011
Our square root method also works for equations in this form. Notice that we

2
00:00:04,011 --> 00:00:08,678
just have a quantity over here, squared equal to some number. This means we can

3
00:00:08,678 --> 00:00:12,756
take the square root of the left side and the right side. When we take the

4
00:00:12,756 --> 00:00:16,977
square root of this side, it undoes the square power, so we're just left with

5
00:00:16,977 --> 00:00:22,859
this quantity, ax plus b. So, I have ax plus b on the left side of our equation

6
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:27,995
and plus or minus root c on the right side of our equation. Next we subtract b

7
00:00:27,995 --> 00:00:32,560
from both sides, so that way we can start to isolate the X. Notice that this

8
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:36,690
negative b, is not like terms with radical c. All I can do, is list this as

9
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:41,960
negative b plus or minus the square root of c. Finally, to get x by itself, we

10
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:47,118
divide both sides by the coefficient of a. So we know x could equal negative b

11
00:00:47,118 --> 00:00:52,408
plus root c divided by a. Or x could equal negative b minus root c, all divided

12
00:00:52,408 --> 00:00:55,590
by a. There's really two solutions here.
