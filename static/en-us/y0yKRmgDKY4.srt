Hi, I'm Arpan,
a course developer at Udacity.

2
00:00:03,819 --> 00:00:07,509
The mock interview you'll watch next is
meant to give you a sense of the kind of

3
00:00:07,509 --> 00:00:11,250
questions you might expect for
a machine learning engineering position.

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:14,370
You'll get the critique each response
that the candidate gives and

5
00:00:14,369 --> 00:00:16,359
hear feedback from the interviewer.

6
00:00:16,359 --> 00:00:20,519
Hopefully, this exercise will help you
prepare well for your own interviews.
