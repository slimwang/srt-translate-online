00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,250
Now that we have our bedroom
properties., I want to talk about

2
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:07,300
a couple more property attribute
you'll see here alongside nonatomic.

3
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:09,920
The attributes strong and weak.

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:13,020
We could have written our bedroom
properties like this, but

5
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:17,440
we didn't actually bother writing strong
because pointers are strong by default.

6
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,400
Although there are some development
teams who always write strong

7
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,190
just to be extra explicit.

8
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:25,830
So when should a reference to a property
be strong, and when should it be weak?

9
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:29,130
Strong references are used for

10
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:32,810
properties that are the primary
responsibility of the class.

11
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:35,380
In other words, owned by the class.

12
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:38,470
These bedrooms are owned
by the house class.

13
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:40,160
Weak references are used for

14
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:44,980
properties that are the primary
responsibility of some other class.

15
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:48,510
There are two times when you should
use weak references for properties.

16
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:50,380
When the property is a delegate and

17
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:53,520
when the property is
a subview of the main view.

18
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,780
Take note, this is important
to avoid memory cycles.

19
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:59,510
For more information on
what causes memory cycles,
