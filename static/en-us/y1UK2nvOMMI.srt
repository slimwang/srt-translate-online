I'm really enjoying this practice of creating functions when we already know

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:07,562
about their zeroes. So, let's keep doing that for a bit. Let's say that, this

3
00:00:07,562 --> 00:00:13,417
time, we have a polynomial that only has zeroes of 2, 3, and 4. And none of

4
00:00:13,417 --> 00:00:17,696
these are repeated. There's just one factor coming from each of these. What

5
00:00:17,696 --> 00:00:19,893
then, is the degree of that polynomial?
