00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:02,274
When I'm searching for
a new place to live,

2
00:00:02,274 --> 00:00:04,698
I want to make sure it's within
a reasonable distance from my office.

3
00:00:04,698 --> 00:00:08,028
Obviously, I don't want to travel
50 miles every day to work.

4
00:00:08,028 --> 00:00:11,731
Especially in the Big Apple, a few miles
can quickly turn in to a few hours.

5
00:00:11,731 --> 00:00:14,858
Maybe it's also important to me
that I can get to work via public

6
00:00:14,859 --> 00:00:15,804
transportation.

7
00:00:15,804 --> 00:00:20,132
Within our site, we want to give users
the option to enter their work location,

8
00:00:20,132 --> 00:00:23,347
daycare, mom's house, or
other important places, and

9
00:00:23,347 --> 00:00:27,496
only show real estate listings within
a certain distance of those places.

10
00:00:27,496 --> 00:00:29,004
How can we do this?

11
00:00:29,004 --> 00:00:32,743
We'll use a magical service
called the Distance Matrix API.

12
00:00:32,743 --> 00:00:36,960
Google's Distance Matrix Service
computes travel distance and journey

13
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,666
duration, between multiple origins and
destinations, given a mode of travel.

14
00:00:41,665 --> 00:00:46,458
Once again, we'll use an HTTP
request to talk about the input and

15
00:00:46,459 --> 00:00:49,170
output for the Distance Matrix API.

16
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:52,823
The request has the same format
as the geocoding request.

17
00:00:52,823 --> 00:00:59,820
We'll specify the service and the output
format, which can be either JSON or XML.

18
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:02,668
Then, we'll define the input parameters.

19
00:01:02,668 --> 00:01:08,185
For the distance matrix API, the only
required parameters are the key,

20
00:01:08,186 --> 00:01:11,723
and at least one origin and
destination pair.

21
00:01:11,722 --> 00:01:16,716
Here, I'm calculating the distance and
duration of travel between New York,

22
00:01:16,716 --> 00:01:19,412
New York and San Francisco, California.

23
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:21,274
Let's take a look at the output.

24
00:01:21,274 --> 00:01:25,272
Again, we see the status and
then we see the distance and

25
00:01:25,272 --> 00:01:27,153
duration of the journey.

26
00:01:27,153 --> 00:01:30,276
We can see here that we
only have one element.

27
00:01:30,275 --> 00:01:34,168
An element is an origin and
destination pair.

28
00:01:34,168 --> 00:01:39,212
Since we only have one origin and one
destination, we only have one element.

29
00:01:39,212 --> 00:01:43,591
If we specify, let's say,
two origins and two destinations,

30
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:46,590
we'd have four elements
with a distance and

31
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:50,256
duration between each origin and
each destination.

32
00:01:50,257 --> 00:01:55,757
Since we didn't specify any travel mode
in this request, it defaults to driving.

33
00:01:55,757 --> 00:02:00,624
It's telling me that it's
a 4,676 km drive which will

34
00:02:00,623 --> 00:02:03,165
take me one day and 18 hours.

35
00:02:03,165 --> 00:02:07,456
Note that the distance value
defaults to meters and

36
00:02:07,456 --> 00:02:10,960
the duration value defaults to seconds.

37
00:02:10,961 --> 00:02:13,559
Let's add in some optional parameters.

38
00:02:13,558 --> 00:02:16,543
I'm adding in a mode here.

39
00:02:16,543 --> 00:02:20,753
We can use driving walking,
bicycling, or transit.

40
00:02:20,752 --> 00:02:22,836
Let's see how long will
take me to bike there.

41
00:02:22,836 --> 00:02:26,161
Also, I probably want to avoid
biking on a freeway, so,

42
00:02:26,161 --> 00:02:30,068
I will include the avoid parameter and
tell it to avoid highways.

43
00:02:30,068 --> 00:02:34,006
Specifying bicycling should you do
that though, as it favors bike pass or

44
00:02:34,007 --> 00:02:35,161
preferred streets.

45
00:02:35,161 --> 00:02:35,777
All right,

46
00:02:35,777 --> 00:02:39,615
it would take me over 11 days to bike
from New York City to San Francisco.

47
00:02:39,616 --> 00:02:42,719
Actually, it would probably take me
several weeks and I might not make it.

48
00:02:42,718 --> 00:02:46,608
We're Googlers and we love biking and
all that, but that's a long way for

49
00:02:46,608 --> 00:02:47,686
me to go to visit RJ.

50
00:02:47,686 --> 00:02:50,367
Probably more realistic would be for
me to take transit.

51
00:02:50,366 --> 00:02:56,752
For transit, I can even specify transit
mode such as rail, bus, subway etc.

52
00:02:56,752 --> 00:02:59,550
Let's avoid long bus rides and
specify rail.

53
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:02,661
Okay so three days, that's not that bad.

54
00:03:02,662 --> 00:03:04,455
I think I'll stick to flying though.
