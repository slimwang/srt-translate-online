00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:05,354
We can easily calculate the probability for discrete samples like this one in a

2
00:00:05,354 --> 00:00:10,620
discrete population, but what about in real life, with huge populations? We

3
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:16,230
can't possibly calculate the mean of every possible sample of size n and even if

4
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:21,597
we could, we wouldn't want to. We ended up with 16 samples when we just had a

5
00:00:21,597 --> 00:00:27,240
population of size 4. What if we had a population of 350 million? Which is often

6
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:31,400
the case. Well, you've already seen that the distribution of sample means is

7
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:37,210
normal. And we know that the mean of all these sample means is the population

8
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:42,943
mean. Remember, the population mean here was 2.5. And the mean of all possible

9
00:00:42,943 --> 00:00:48,132
sample means is also 2.5. So, if we have a random sample and we take the mean of

10
00:00:48,132 --> 00:00:53,550
it, how can we know where it falls on this distribution of sample means. We're

11
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:57,938
missing one important thing. Do we need to know the total number in the

12
00:00:57,938 --> 00:01:03,538
population? The standard deviation of the distribution of sample means? Which is

13
00:01:03,538 --> 00:01:07,379
this here. Or, the total number of possible samples?
