1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:03,380
So given what you've seen so
far both in this course and

2
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:06,570
in your own experience of using
the internet and web services.

3
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:09,410
Which of the following problems
do you think might cause a TCP

4
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:13,310
session to time out for instance
between a browser and a web server?

5
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:17,190
First, could a timeout because
the host at the other end is powered

6
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:18,480
off suddenly?

7
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,140
Second, could a timeout because
a windstorm blows down the cable between

8
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:23,850
you and your ISP?

9
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:27,520
Third, could it timeout because your
DNS server has stopped working?

10
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:30,310
Four, could a timeout because
you're connecting to a server that

11
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:31,830
doesn't exist?

12
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:35,610
Or five, could it timeout because
you're using a Windows PC for instance,

13
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:38,520
to watch this course, but
Microsoft's website is down?
