1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,537
Congratulations.

2
00:00:01,537 --> 00:00:02,700
>> We finished the course.

3
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:03,325
>> Yay.

4
00:00:03,325 --> 00:00:06,959
[SOUND] Tommy, do you like the app?

5
00:00:06,959 --> 00:00:07,828
>> I think he does.

6
00:00:07,828 --> 00:00:08,477
>> Yeah.
[LAUGH]

7
00:00:08,477 --> 00:00:09,550
>> So Tommy approved and

8
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:11,760
you're an official Android rockstar now.

9
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:12,877
>> Yay.

10
00:00:12,877 --> 00:00:15,720
>> And you might be asking
where did she go from here?

11
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:18,680
>> Now as you continue to build on more
apps, you can either continue learning

12
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:21,160
with our intermediate Android
developer unit degree.

13
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:21,930
>> Or you can pick and

14
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:26,400
choose from any of the free Android
courses listed at Udacity.com/google.

15
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,120
>> Or perhaps continue practice
building an app on your own.

16
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:32,290
Maybe walk down the street to that local
small business you visit often, and

17
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:34,190
see if they need some help
in their Android app.

18
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:36,540
It's also fun to recruit some friends
along the way to help you out.

19
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:39,480
>> If you keep your eyes open,
there are opportunities all around you.

20
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:43,510
So we wish you the best of luck, and
keep us posted on how things go.

21
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:47,110
>> Now if you'll excuse us, there's a
particular fridge we need to go raid for

22
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:47,795
some cheese.

23
00:00:47,795 --> 00:00:48,797
>> Good idea!

24
00:00:48,797 --> 00:00:49,402
Let's go.

25
00:00:49,402 --> 00:00:49,950
Come on, Tommy.

26
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:52,160
Bye, everyone!
