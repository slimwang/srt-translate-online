1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
If this is the position, we see that position

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
always increases with time.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
There is no way that the derivative can be negative,

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
that the rate of change can be negative.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Otherwise, the position would have to go down

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
if that was the case, so we can rule out the red version.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Now let's look at this step, almost a step.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
We need to ramp up the velocity

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
and ramp down the velocity.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Here, we accelerate, and here, we decelerate.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Okay. And this is an almost precise replica of that one,

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
so the same shape--it has to be the green one.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
It cannot be the purple one.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Now for this curve,

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
we accelerate positively

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
The velocity grows.

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
You see that we start with small velocity.

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
The velocity gets larger as we go

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
up to that point here.

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
So acceleration has to be positive.

21
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The rate of change of velocity has to be positive,

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
which rules out the green curve.

23
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
We are left with deciding whether

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
the red curve is the right one or

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
the purple curve is the right one.

26
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Look at this part of the curve.

27
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The position is decreasing.

28
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
If position is decreasing,

29
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
velocity has to be negative.

30
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
See, we start with a velocity of almost 0,

31
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
and then the velocity becomes very negative.

32
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
This is very steep.

33
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The rate of change is very high in a negative direction,

34
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
which means that we need acceleration to the

35
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
negative--strong negative acceleration.

36
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
It has to be this red part.

37
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
It can't be that green part.

38
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
And here, acceleration is positive again--

39
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
--high and positive--

40
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
to turn that negative velocity

41
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
into a velocity of 0.

42
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
We got a positive peak in the acceleration.

43
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
And eventually, the acceleration is 0, the velocity is 0,

44
00:02:07,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and the rate of change of the position is 0, so it's the red curve.
