1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,780
Okay so let's talk about step two, accessing the content provider.

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:05,770
I'm going to go over to the code right now.

3
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:07,930
Okay so we're here at the MainActivity.

4
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:11,620
And the two lines of code that I want you to look at are these lines right here.

5
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:13,750
Let's go ahead and take a closer look at those.

6
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:15,430
Okay, so here's the code again.

7
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:16,670
And we've got some new concepts and

8
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:20,030
some new words here like ContentResolver and cursor.

9
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:22,860
So we're going to break this all down in the next few nodes.

10
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:25,480
I'm going to start by looking at the first line here, and

11
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:28,960
specifically we're going to talk about the ContentResolver.

12
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,159
So, this our original diagram that I've been showing you a lot.

13
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:33,300
It's pretty simplistic.

14
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,220
It's actually a bit too simplistic, so

15
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:37,500
let me show you something that's a little bit more accurate.

16
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:41,330
So the more accurate version has this class called a ContentResolver.

17
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:43,570
What is a ContentResolver?

18
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:47,090
As I mentioned before, there are a lot of content providers.

19
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:50,080
Besides the user dictionary provider that we're talking right now,

20
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:52,150
there's a context content provider.

21
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:54,010
There's a calendar content provider.

22
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:55,880
There's an alarms content provider.

23
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:59,230
And a handful of other standard Android content providers.

24
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:02,450
Also, your app is not the only app on the system.

25
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:06,730
So, what helps all of these apps communicate with the content providers that

26
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:08,040
they're interested in?

27
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,722
Well that, my friend, is the job of the content resolver.

28
00:01:10,722 --> 00:01:14,770
The ContentResolver helps your app connect with the correct content provider.

29
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:18,200
It does this by looking at whatever request that your app sends to

30
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,580
the content resolver.

31
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:23,050
And then, looking up which content provider it happens to be for.

32
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:26,980
Using a ContentResolver, it's really easy for your app to talk to one or

33
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:29,230
two or even more content providers.

34
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:32,480
Knowing that, let's go back to the code, and take a look at what's happening.

35
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:36,320
Okay, so, now, this line of code right here, should be pretty clear.

36
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,010
This statement here,

37
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:41,310
is asking the Android system to give us access to a ContentResolver.

38
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:44,780
And it's saving it in an instance variable called resolver.

39
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:47,600
Now that we have the resolver, we're calling this query method on it.

40
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,790
So what does this method do?

41
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:52,260
There are really four major things that you want to do with data.

42
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:54,610
The first is, you want to read from the data.

43
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:57,580
You also might want to add one or more values to the data.

44
00:01:57,580 --> 00:02:00,270
You could also change a pre-existing value in the data.

45
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:02,220
Or delete something from the data.

46
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:07,360
And these four actions map to four methods, query, insert, update, and delete.

47
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,300
So you can call resolver.query to read the data.

48
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:12,760
Note, when you call resolver.query,

49
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:16,550
it's calling the corresponding query method in the Content Provider.

50
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:19,970
Okay, so right now we know what the content resolver is and

51
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:23,420
we know how it helps us in some way access the correct content provider.

52
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:25,860
Although, we're going to talk about that a little bit more.

53
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:28,280
We've also talked a little bit about step three.

54
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,050
Right here we're

55
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:32,220
actually using the content provider through the content resolver.

56
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:33,450
We have a couple more mysteries to

57
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:36,790
solve before we can print out this information to the UI.

58
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:39,540
First of all there's all of these parameters in here which we

59
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:40,770
need to talk about.

60
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:43,970
We also need to learn exactly what a cursor is, so let's get started.
