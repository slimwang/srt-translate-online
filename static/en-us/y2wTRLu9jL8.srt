Thank you for your response.

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:06,740
Please discuss your ideas about using different metrics on the forums.

3
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:09,130
Before we move on to the modeling section,

4
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:11,800
I would like to give you some food for thought.

5
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:15,650
As you have seen, distance metrics are very useful.

6
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:20,340
In our case, we have used the distance metric quite literally to

7
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:23,750
measure distance between two points on the surface of the earth.

8
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:27,250
However, when we measure difference between two PDFs or

9
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:30,530
functions, we can use distances as well.

10
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:32,369
In the following sections,

11
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:37,600
we are going to introduce what are called the risk and loss functions.

12
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,760
You will see that the lost function is essentially a distance measurement.

13
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:45,980
As we move on to build and verify the model,

14
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:50,920
feel free to use features you chose in the quiz instead or

15
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:55,890
in addition to our features that we have used so far in the analysis.

16
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:58,210
And see how the model performs.
