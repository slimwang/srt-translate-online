1
00:00:00,552 --> 00:00:02,358
Now with this in place, now here comes the

2
00:00:02,358 --> 00:00:04,600
really interesting question. It’s assignment

3
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:06,637
number two. And again it’s a programming

4
00:00:06,638 --> 00:00:09,939
assignment – free to skip.

5
00:00:09,939 --> 00:00:12,016
Now that we have a function of flip, it gives

6
00:00:12,016 --> 00:00:15,898
me this list of a thousand outcomes from which

7
00:00:15,898 --> 00:00:18,512
I cannot derive things like the mean. Run this

8
00:00:18,512 --> 00:00:21,638
thing itself a thousand times and each time you

9
00:00:21,638 --> 00:00:25,927
get a different mean, so this means zero, mean

10
00:00:25,927 --> 00:00:29,962
one and so on all the way to a mean nine, nine,nine.

11
00:00:29,962 --> 00:00:32,759
And these means are continuous values

12
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:35,563
obviously, between zero and one and give you

13
00:00:35,563 --> 00:00:37,800
the same function as before, mean, variance,

14
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,595
standard deviation, and flip and as I scroll

15
00:00:40,596 --> 00:00:44,130
down, I find this function sample, I want you

16
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:48,421
to put in code over here so that when I sample

17
00:00:48,421 --> 00:00:52,230
with the same n, I run the flip experiment a

18
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:54,982
thousand times and every single time I compute

19
00:00:54,982 --> 00:00:58,109
the mean and now I assemble a list of all the

20
00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:01,601
means into this thing called outcomes.

21
00:01:01,601 --> 00:01:04,191
The means will be continuous, I can do a history

22
00:01:04,191 --> 00:01:07,019
plot, it’ll be better with many bins, so this

23
00:01:07,019 --> 00:01:09,814
notation over here gives me 30 bins. And to

24
00:01:09,814 --> 00:01:13,798
give you a feel for what to expect, this is

25
00:01:13,798 --> 00:01:16,632
a typical histogram I get out as a result.

26
00:01:16,632 --> 00:01:20,325
It’s really beautiful. If I increase n to 2000,

27
00:01:20,325 --> 00:01:23,010
I get this histogram over here. Apologize some

28
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:26,230
numbers are a little illegible over here but

29
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:28,892
the center of it is 0.5 and it falls off to

30
00:01:28,892 --> 00:01:32,300
smaller number to the left, to the right. You

31
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,857
can think of it as a distribution over the

32
00:01:34,857 --> 00:01:38,768
means outcomes of large numbers of coin flips

33
00:01:38,768 --> 00:01:41,626
and has an interesting shape. So go ahead and

34
00:01:41,626 --> 00:01:43,271
program it and see if you can reproduce these

35
00:01:43,271 --> 00:01:47,000
results.
