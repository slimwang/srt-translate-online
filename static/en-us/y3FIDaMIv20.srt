1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,740
Let's take a look at the answer about which intellectual property matched

2
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:05,740
what is protectable in examples.

3
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:09,170
For trademark, what is protectable is branding.

4
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:11,850
Examples are marks and logos and slogans.

5
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:17,250
For copyright, it's creative, authored works and expressions. Not ideas.

6
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:21,660
The examples could be software, songs, movies, website content.

7
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:26,630
For trade secrets, what's protectable is anything. Secrets that you think have economic value.

8
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:31,400
Examples are non-public technology like the Coke secret recipe,

9
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:35,040
or your proprietary customer list, or some kind of algorithm or formula

10
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,940
you didn't want to patent.

11
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:40,640
For contract and non-disclosure agreements, what is protectable is whatever you

12
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:45,350
and the person who is going to do the deal with you have defined in the contract

13
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:47,580
and is enforceable in the law.

14
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:52,890
You could have technology, business information, etc. as examples.

15
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:58,090
Finally patents. So what's protectable are non-obvious inventions.

16
00:00:58,090 --> 00:01:03,230
Examples are new technology that haven't been previously patented or applied for,

17
00:01:03,230 --> 99:59:59,999
and you have to be first.
