00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,900
A network protocol defines the rules and
conventions for

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:06,310
communications between two parties.

3
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:09,840
A security protocol defines
the rules and conventions for

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,040
secure work communications
between two parties.

5
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,920
So what are these rules and
conventions for secure communications?

6
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:21,770
That is, suppose Alice and Bob want to
communicate securely over the internet.

7
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:23,010
What should they do?

8
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:27,130
They need to authenticate each other so
that Alice knows that she's

9
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:32,259
communicating with Bob and Bob knows
that he's communicating with Alice.

10
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:35,340
Further, if they want to
communicate securely,

11
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:38,140
most likely they want to
encrypt their messages.

12
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:41,530
Therefore, they need to establish and
exchange keys, and

13
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:45,730
agree on what cryptographic
operations and algorithms to use.

14
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:49,857
The basic tools, or the building
blocks of these security protocols,

15
00:00:49,857 --> 00:00:52,886
are the public-key and
secret-key algorithms and

16
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:55,250
hash functions that we have discussed.
