1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
So far, we talked about the fully observable case,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
and I'd like to get back to the more general case

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
of partial observability.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Now, to warn you, I don't think it's worthwhile in this class

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
to go into full depth about the type of techniques

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
that are being used for planning and uncertainty

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
if the world is partially observable.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
But I'd like to give you a good flavor

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
about what it really means to plan in information spaces

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
that we reflect the types of methods that are being brought to bear

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
in planning and uncertainty.

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Like my Stanford class, I don't go into details here either

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
because the details are much more subject to more specialized classes,

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
but I hope you can enjoy the type of flavor of materials

15
00:00:42,000 --> 99:59:59,999
that you're going to get to see in the next couple of minutes.
