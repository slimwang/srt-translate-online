00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,666
Now, again, there is a way we can do this without a calculator. We can just

2
00:00:03,666 --> 00:00:10,478
divide 1.5 by 3 and then multiply that by 10 to the 11th over 10 to the 8th. If

3
00:00:10,478 --> 00:00:14,376
you do that, what numbers do you end up with? Think about how you divide these

4
00:00:14,376 --> 00:00:17,009
terms when the base is the same.
