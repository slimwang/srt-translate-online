00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,401
Now that we know that finding a midpoint is as simple as averaging x coordinates

2
00:00:04,413 --> 00:00:08,325
and y coordinates, let's go back to this quadrilateral we, we are looking at

3
00:00:08,337 --> 00:00:12,776
earlier. Can you find the midpoint of each side? Don't forget to write these as

4
00:00:12,788 --> 00:00:14,279
points, so with coordinates
