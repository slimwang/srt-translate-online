1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:04,560
I think one of the cool parts about
D3 is how its APIs design and

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,280
how it makes you think.

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:09,330
Since every method in D3
returns the element or

4
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:12,110
selection of elements that
method was called upon,

5
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:14,290
you can naturally chain
method from one to the next.

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,630
Keep in mind that any
changes that we've made so

7
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:21,710
far to the page are client side only and
they're not permanent.

8
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:25,360
We can refresh the page at any time to
get back to the original styling and

9
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:26,120
content of the page.

10
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:29,980
All right, let's try something
a little bit more difficult.

11
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:33,090
Let's see if we can change
the Udacity logo on the page

12
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:34,338
to a different version of the logo.

13
00:00:34,338 --> 00:00:36,550
If I right-click on the element and

14
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:39,640
inspect it,
I can see that this is an image tag.

15
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:44,140
But wait, there aren't any class names
on the elements, and the element doesn't

16
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:48,350
have an ID, does this mean that
we can't select the image?

17
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:52,270
It turns out that we can select the
image, we just need to look one level

18
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:56,790
higher or multiple levels higher
at any of the parent elements.

19
00:00:56,790 --> 00:01:00,170
This image tag sits within an A tag.

20
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:02,590
So, the A tag is the parent.

21
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:05,370
We can select this parent by
using the select method and

22
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:06,659
passing in the class name.

23
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:10,050
I'm going to pass in both class names,

24
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:13,130
in case the class names
are used elsewhere on the page.

25
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:18,150
This makes it so that D3 only selects
elements with both class names, of nav

26
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:23,630
brand and logo, which, should hopefully
just be the A tag element on the page.

27
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:26,090
And sure enough this
returns what I'd like.

28
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:30,020
Now, since the a tag also
has an ID of header-logo,

29
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:32,590
I could use that to select the element.

30
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:36,080
Remember that when using ID selectors,
you need to pass in the hash, or

31
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:38,280
pound symbol, before the name.

32
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,610
Let's save that selection
into a variable and

33
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:43,590
call it parent_el,
short for parent element.

34
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:45,590
Since D3 returned a selection,

35
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:49,040
we can use D3's methods to
make another selection.

36
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,790
So, I can use select
on the parent element

37
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:54,520
to select the image tag
that sits within it.

38
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,887
This returns the image tag
that we want to update.

39
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:01,790
To change the source of the image tag,
we need to change the source attribute.

40
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:06,780
We can use that atter method to do so,
by passing it an attribute name and

41
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,639
the value that we'd like to set.

42
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,729
So, if I just look at
the source attribute,

43
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:16,710
I'll see that it matches what is
currently there, assets/udacity.svg.

44
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:20,120
If we wanted to change a property
say like the all text and

45
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:24,530
I would pass in a different value as
a second perimeter to the method.

46
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:29,200
So we'll change this all
text of logo to Udacity.

47
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,430
Now, again I made this selection
a little bit more complicated than

48
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:36,430
it needed to be, since I used
this intermediate parent element.

49
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:41,640
To make the selection simpler I can just
make one selection using the parent ID

50
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:44,940
and then a space for the name of the
child element that we want to select.

51
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:50,670
So I'll select the parent a tag
with the id of header-logo, and

52
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,340
then I'll select the child image.

53
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:57,650
And here I'll change the alt
text from udacity back to logo.

54
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:02,470
There's certainly more than one way
to select elements on the page, so

55
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:05,560
don't be surprised or confused as
you work through this course and

56
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,400
our answers might be slightly
different than yours.

57
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,990
For example you might've tried
to use two class names to select

58
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:16,170
that parent element a-tag and
then change the all-text logo.

59
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:19,870
I find using the ID selection a little
bit simpler in this case but,

60
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:22,980
just know that there's always more than
one way to select elements on a page.
