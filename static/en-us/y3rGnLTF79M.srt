00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,096
So, I'll pick up where I left off. I wrote those tests to protect the

2
00:00:03,096 --> 00:00:06,889
functionality of the person class. So, I can run them again to find out which

3
00:00:06,889 --> 00:00:11,298
method's broke when I changed the friends variable. Looks like the first thing

4
00:00:11,298 --> 00:00:16,309
that's broken is that I'm trying to add a string into my array list of person.

5
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:19,760
So, I no longer need to get the name out of the friend before adding it. If I

6
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:25,598
run the test, it looks like the getFriends method is still broken. But the

7
00:00:25,598 --> 00:00:28,898
getFriends method that takes a separator is good. The get number of friends

8
00:00:28,898 --> 00:00:32,790
method seems to be working alright still. So I'll need to look at this original

9
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:36,452
getFriends method. When we run the two string method on the friends array list,

10
00:00:36,452 --> 00:00:41,430
it doesn't have a good way of printing a simple representation for each friend.

11
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:44,782
I can think of two convenient solutions to this problem. One possibility is to

12
00:00:44,782 --> 00:00:50,520
delete this, and just use the other getFriends method, that we already fixed.

13
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:56,344
I'll just call getFriends, and pass in a comma and a space as a separator. And

14
00:00:56,344 --> 00:01:00,530
now if I run the test, the getFriends method prints what I would hope.
