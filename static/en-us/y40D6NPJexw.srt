1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,780
These four types of competition may
seem like a lot, and they can be.

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:05,880
But you don't need to focus
on all of them at once.

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:08,119
It's just really to help
you organize your thoughts.

4
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:12,030
Now with our flavored water example,
if you're a brand manager of this water

5
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:15,400
bottle, you'll need to analyze
all four levels of competition so

6
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:18,430
you know how to position yourselves
in terms of the brand and

7
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:21,300
in terms of real placement of
this product on store shelves.

8
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,850
But as a startup with an app,
it's good to know the different types of

9
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:29,865
competition you have out there, at
the different levels, but don't bother

10
00:00:29,865 --> 00:00:33,830
over-analyzing the competition at levels
that make less sense for you right now.

11
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:35,530
Like the budget level.

12
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:38,720
So now that we know the different
types of competition,

13
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:40,680
how do we figure out
where we fit among them?

14
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:41,840
Well, let's talk about that now.
