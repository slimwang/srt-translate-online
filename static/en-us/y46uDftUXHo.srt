00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:02,687
So now you have the basics of Tableau.

2
00:00:02,687 --> 00:00:05,650
What you want to do next is to
collect your figures into a dashboard

3
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:06,970
or a story.

4
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:10,130
With these you can share
your plots with others and

5
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:12,960
easily make them interactive, so
they can poke around your data.
