1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,796
The object starts in model coordinates, choice F and is transformed to world

2
00:00:03,796 --> 00:00:08,227
coordinates, choice I. The object then gets transformed to view space a, so

3
00:00:08,227 --> 00:00:12,590
that the world is oriented with respect to the camera's frame of reference. In

4
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:15,470
practice we often go directly from object space to camera space with a single

5
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:19,604
transform, the model view matrix. The projection matrix is applied to get the

6
00:00:19,604 --> 00:00:23,438
clip coordinates, choice h. And the coordinates are divided by w to get the

7
00:00:23,438 --> 00:00:27,352
model into normalized device coordinates, choice e. Finally the data is

8
00:00:27,352 --> 00:00:30,172
converted into Window Coordinates to get it into an image to put it on the

9
00:00:30,172 --> 00:00:31,929
screen, choice C.
