00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,465
In this session,
we discussed variables and constants.

2
00:00:03,465 --> 00:00:07,560
They're indeed two of the most basic
ingredients of any application.

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:11,550
As you've seen, you can accomplish many
simple tasks using just the variables

4
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:15,370
and constants, but soon, you'll start
combining variables into larger

5
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:18,520
constructs to build solutions
to more complex problems.
