00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:03,090
It's time to update
your Weather App again.

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:04,939
Here's what I want you to do.

3
00:00:04,939 --> 00:00:07,689
Add a gulp build project to your app.

4
00:00:07,689 --> 00:00:11,623
If you're not familiar with gulp check
out the instructor notes below for

5
00:00:11,623 --> 00:00:15,305
a starter file you can use and
to get a starting guide.

6
00:00:15,305 --> 00:00:20,275
Then replace your existing service
worker with one created by sw precache.

7
00:00:21,295 --> 00:00:25,915
Be sure to use the runtime caching
option to cache the app data.

8
00:00:25,915 --> 00:00:27,735
When you've completed this step,

9
00:00:27,735 --> 00:00:31,310
your app should work exactly
the same as it did before.

10
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:34,600
But now you've simplified
the build process and

11
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:39,110
reduced some of the headaches of
ruling your own service worker.

12
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:42,610
That means if you change
a single file on the App Shell,

13
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:45,730
only that file will need to be updated.

14
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:49,880
Be sure to compare your app to
the link in the instructor notes below

15
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,639
to make sure it works exactly the same.

16
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:56,560
And if you want to learn more about
gulp, check out the tooling and
