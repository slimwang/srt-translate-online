1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Okay, so the correct answer is for the title,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
we're going to use a string.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
For the art, we're also going to use a string,

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and for the created, we're also going--we're going to use a date time.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Now, actually I lied to you,

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
we're not going to use a string, we're going to use something called text,

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
but there is no way for me to ask a quiz without giving away the answer.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I learned while writing this that there is

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
another type called text,

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
and the difference between a string and a text

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
is that a string must be under 500 characters

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
and can be indexed.

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Text can be greater than 500 characters,

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
which is really handy for ASCII art.

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
ASCII art that is under 500 characters is not very fun at all.

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I actually learned this while building this lesson,

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
and text cannot be indexed,

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
which means of course that we can't sort based on a text property.

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
This is fine, you know in our case, we're going to

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
sort probably on the created property

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
so we can show things in order.

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
We won't be able to sort things by the artwork,

23
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
which is fine, because what would that even mean?

24
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
So if we were to use the string data type,

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
which we're going to use on our titles, yeah it is indexed so you can do queries,

26
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
you can say get me the artwork to title = X.

27
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
You can't--we can't do a query get me the art where text = X

28
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
because it's not indexed.

29
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Let's go ahead and define our data type.
