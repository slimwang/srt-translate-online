1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,110
So what does R look like?

2
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:04,840
Well there are two ways to think about this,

3
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:06,320
first we'll think about it the hard way.

4
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:15,280
R A to B expresses how each basis vector in A would be expressed in terms of B.

5
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:21,460
So the first column of R A B is the component of the I

6
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:28,810
vector of A expressed in terms of how much it has in the i direction in B,

7
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:33,560
in the j direction in B, and in the k direction in B.

8
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:38,240
So you can think of it as like the dot product between i A, and

9
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:42,510
each of the components of B, i B, j B, k B.

10
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:46,770
And likewise each of the following columns is done, is, is that way.

11
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:49,838
So, one way of thinking about this is that the columns of

12
00:00:49,838 --> 00:00:55,740
R A B are the i vector of A expressed in the B coordinate frame.

13
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:58,420
Then the j vector of A in the B coordinate frame, and

14
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:01,660
the k vector of A in the B coordinate frame.

15
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:03,830
All right, so why is this true?

16
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:05,740
Well let's think about it this way.

17
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:11,927
Suppose I had a point, vector, in the A frame.

18
00:01:11,927 --> 00:01:17,230
That was just at value of 1, 0, 0, okay?

19
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:22,090
So what that means it's actually a distance of 1 in the i direction of

20
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:26,760
the A frame and none in the j and k of the A frame.

21
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:29,870
What should the value of that be?

22
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:30,480
All right?

23
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,450
And I'll just write that down here.

24
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:35,180
Well, this multiplies this.

25
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:36,400
This to that so.

26
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:42,760
So it would just give me the iA dotted with iB.

27
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:48,270
So the first component of the transformed frame is just the i vectors amount in,

28
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:50,130
in the i direction of B.

29
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:52,360
Well, now lets go through this.

30
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,090
We go one, two, three.

31
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:58,050
It's again, is going to get iA.jB.

32
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:01,680
Okay, and again iA.kB.

33
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,750
In other words it's just what it says here is what we have to

34
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:07,910
get out if we had just a 1, 0, 0,

35
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:12,250
needs to be how that vector is dotted which each of the components.

36
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:16,010
And that's why this matrix can be thought of as having it's

37
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:21,110
column vectors as just being the each of the basis vectors of

38
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:24,460
the a frame expressed in terms of the b frame.

39
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:25,730
Do you get that?

40
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:27,480
So on the sides you'll have that.

41
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,770
So just press the pause button and that way you can.

42
00:02:35,809 --> 00:02:38,220
See what's going on.

43
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:40,850
Just to remind you I labeled this that the columns of

44
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:45,000
the rotation matrix are the axes of frame A expressed in frame B.

45
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,370
Why? because we just went through all that nonsense showing it to you.

46
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:53,580
By the way, it can also be thought of as the rows are just the column,

47
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:59,790
are just the bases of the B vector expressed in the A frame, right?

48
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:03,550
So here's iB in, in the, in terms of the i component of A.

49
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:05,160
Here's iB in terms of the j.

50
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,510
Here's iB in k.

51
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:10,010
So you think about this is that if I were to transpose that vector.

52
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:11,882
So I made the columns the rows,

53
00:03:11,882 --> 00:03:17,230
the rows the columns, I would now have instead of RAB, I'd have RBA, all right?

54
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:19,120
This is an orthogonal matrix, right?

55
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,840
The orthogonal matrix, all of the rows,

56
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,960
all the columns are unit vectors that are perpendicular to each other.

57
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:30,790
So the determinate so the, the magnets of determinate is 1.

58
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:33,350
And it's your traditional rotation matrix and

59
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:38,300
by the way, really important is that the inverse is equal to the transpose.

60
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:40,580
So, if you had a rotation matrix and you want to go back and

61
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:44,340
forth between the two, the inverse and transpose, which realize it has to be.

62
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:49,680
Because the inverse of RAB has to be RBA and we just showed how the,

63
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,270
the rows are the sort of the transposed of the spec to the columns.
