1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:01,791
So the answer here is that what we're going to want to do

2
00:00:01,791 --> 00:00:03,749
is look at the least significant bit.

3
00:00:03,749 --> 00:00:07,845
That means we'll take the bit representation of i and end it with the value 1,

4
00:00:07,845 --> 00:00:11,055
which is only going to leave us with the value of the least significant bit.

5
00:00:11,055 --> 00:00:14,494
And then we're going to test whether that bit is 0 or 1.

6
00:00:14,494 --> 00:00:16,930
And we only want to keep the ones that are 0.

7
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:21,598
We only want this to return true if that least significant bit is 0.
