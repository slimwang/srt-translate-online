00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,070
We're going to use a strategy to tackle this problem just like we've done

2
00:00:04,082 --> 00:00:08,624
before. We're going to make this problem easier. So we're going to use different

3
00:00:08,636 --> 00:00:13,079
fractions instead of 2/5 and 1/4. Let's use 1/2 and 1/3 instead. So I rewritten

4
00:00:13,091 --> 00:00:17,695
my question down here. Before we answer this problem, let's actually predict. So

5
00:00:17,707 --> 00:00:21,964
if we frost 1/2 of the cake in vanilla icing and 1/3 of it in strawberry icing.

6
00:00:22,042 --> 00:00:26,053
What fraction of the cake is actually frosted? Would it be less than 2/5?

7
00:00:26,435 --> 00:00:31,467
Exactly 2/5 Or more than 2/5? Draw some diagrams to help you out. Let's actually

8
00:00:31,479 --> 00:00:36,052
consider a round cake. And here's what 2/5 of a round cake frosted would look

9
00:00:36,064 --> 00:00:40,687
like. Notice I have my whole chocolate cake, and 2/5 of it has been frosted in

10
00:00:40,699 --> 00:00:45,595
this blue icing. So, what do you think 1/2 and 1/3 of a cake covered in icing

11
00:00:45,607 --> 00:00:47,590
would look like? Make your choice.
