00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,969
Now, recall that the browser builds a Tree-Like Structure of the page.

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:10,730
And when I say, tree, I don't literally mean this type of tree.

3
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:13,250
I just mean a branching structure.

4
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:18,820
Sideways triangles are an HTML element.

5
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:23,210
Each has an opening tag and a closing tag.

6
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:28,260
Now this can simply be text, like you see here.

7
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:36,347
Or it can be another element, like this span or this a.

8
00:00:36,347 --> 00:00:39,066
So that we can get a better visual understanding,

9
00:00:39,066 --> 00:00:41,278
let's draw this structure ourselves.

10
00:00:41,278 --> 00:00:44,549
First, we have this div element.

11
00:00:44,549 --> 00:00:51,789
Then inside of the div, we have an h2 and a p element.

12
00:00:51,789 --> 00:00:56,453
Then inside of this h2, we have the span element and

13
00:00:56,453 --> 00:00:59,427
inside span, we have some text.

14
00:00:59,427 --> 00:01:01,850
Now if we go back to the p element.

15
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:08,570
Inside, we have text and two a elements.

16
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:12,990
And then inside of each of the a elements, we have text.

17
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:17,270
And now it's time for you to explore the structure of a page on your own.

18
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:21,160
Please follow the link we have provided in the instructor note section below.

19
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:23,430
And open Google's Developer Tools.

20
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:27,880
Then create your own Tree-Like Structure to describe the page.

21
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:32,370
Make sure to fill in the boxes in the same order that they appear in the tree.

22
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:36,310
And if the element contains text, write the word text in the box
