00:00:00,155 --> 00:00:05,040
Eucher's theory says that only the
numbers that are relatively prime to n

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,020
have multiplicative inverse not n.

3
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:10,390
So, what does relatively prime mean?

4
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:12,370
If x is relatively prime to n,

5
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:18,110
that means there is no common factor
between x and n other than 1.

6
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:22,977
For example, three is relatively
prime to 10 whereas two

7
00:00:22,977 --> 00:00:25,710
is not relatively prime to 10.

8
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:30,890
For given n how many integers
are relatively prime to n?

9
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:34,520
This is measured as
a totient function of n.

10
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:36,950
How do we compute totient n?

11
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:42,960
If n is a prime number, then totient
n is n-1, because every number that's

12
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:49,085
smaller than n is also relatively primed
to n because n is prime number itself.

13
00:00:49,085 --> 00:00:52,055
If n equal to p times q and p and

14
00:00:52,055 --> 00:00:56,735
q are prime numbers, then totient
n is p minus 1 times q minus 1.

15
00:00:56,735 --> 00:00:59,515
You can verify this easily on your own.

16
00:00:59,515 --> 00:01:04,974
More generally, if n equals to p
times q and p and q are relatively

17
00:01:04,974 --> 00:01:10,245
prime to each other, then totient
n is totient p times totient q.
