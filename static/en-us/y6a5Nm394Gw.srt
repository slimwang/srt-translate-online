1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:00,920
What do you think?

2
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:02,900
>> I think it's hill climbing.

3
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:03,250
>> Me, too.

4
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:06,820
>> It's certainly not simulated annealing because there's no annealing.

5
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:07,250
>> Yup.

6
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:09,780
>> Simulated or otherwise. You might think

7
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:12,110
it's genetic algorithms because you've got all

8
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:14,950
of these centers that are all moving around at once, but they're all a

9
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:17,000
part of the ultimate answer. They're not

10
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,380
populations. So it's really hill climbing. You

11
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:21,420
just take a step towards a configuration

12
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:25,060
that's better than the configuration you had before.

13
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:27,440
>> That's right, except what we haven't said yet is the

14
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:30,620
way we defined hill climbing, it actually evaluated the score and

15
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:34,690
chose a neighbor that maximized the score. And we didn't show

16
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:37,030
that these steps actually do that. We just defined them in

17
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:41,110
a particular way. Here's the wicked cool thing. It really does

18
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:45,100
do hill climbing. It really does find the neighbor that maximizes

19
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:48,020
the score, minimizes the error in this case. So let's show

20
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:50,080
that because it's kind of neat. Every time I see this

21
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,670
I'm always surprised and delighted.

22
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:53,640
>> Oh, I'm looking forward to being delighted.
