1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:04,090
The true power of docker is the ability
to not only build images, but

2
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:05,710
share them with others.

3
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:10,090
To do that we'll need to host our images
on a remote container image registry

4
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:11,050
such as the Docker Hub.

5
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:15,120
Review the output of
the docker images command and

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,850
notice the name of our
monolith container.

7
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:21,420
By default all doc images
go to the Docker Hub

8
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:23,260
which assume that you
own that repository.

9
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:29,350
So what we're going to do is use our own
name space which is our Docker username.

10
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:32,830
So what we'll have to do is add
our user name to our Docker image

11
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:35,350
using the Docker tag command command.

12
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:38,290
From the help output,
you can see that we take an existing

13
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:43,540
image tag combination and
we add a user name and a repository.

14
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:47,720
The repository would be important if we
were pushed into a different repository

15
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:52,650
other than the in the default
docker hub like GCR or QUAY.IO.

16
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:55,610
But since we're not,
we'll just add a username.

17
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:57,890
Let's add the username using
the docker tag command.

18
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:03,730
Now if we use the Docker image command,
you can see we have our tag.

19
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:09,110
From this output you can see that
the Kelsey Hightower Monolith image name

20
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:12,920
has the same image ID
as a monolith image.

21
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:17,290
Now we are ready to push our current
tenor image to the docker hub.

22
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:21,220
Used the Docker push command to push
our image up to the Docker hub.

23
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:22,640
So that didn't work.

24
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,470
That's because we need to log in
before we can push to the registry.

25
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,580
We can use the docker
login command to do that.

26
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,920
Now let's try to push
our Docker image again.

27
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:34,330
It worked this time, and

28
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:36,980
now we have a hosted image
that we can share with others.
