1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,120
So, this is the solution set for our compound inequality. If you got it right,

2
00:00:04,217 --> 00:00:08,485
nice work. If we stack the number lines on top of each other, like this, we can

3
00:00:08,497 --> 00:00:12,880
see that there's a region of intersection. These are the numbers that are shared

4
00:00:12,892 --> 00:00:17,215
between the inequalities. They make both of the inequalities true. And this is

5
00:00:17,227 --> 00:00:21,585
why we learned about intersections, and really helps us figure out what numbers

6
00:00:21,597 --> 00:00:25,853
make both inequalities true. We can see this region of intersection on one

7
00:00:25,865 --> 00:00:29,965
number line. This is the solution set. We can also write it in interval

8
00:00:29,977 --> 00:00:34,781
notation. So, notice that an and compound inequality makes an intersection, or a

9
00:00:34,793 --> 00:00:39,419
region between points. And any of these numbers would work in both inequalities.

10
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:44,015
Let's check that out real quick. Let's check 6. We're going to let x equal 6 and

11
00:00:44,027 --> 00:00:47,830
check the solution. So, plugging in 6, I get 7 less than or equal to 9 and

12
00:00:47,842 --> 00:00:51,615
plugging in 6 over here, I get negative 8 is less than or equal to negative 7.

13
00:00:51,712 --> 00:00:55,580
Both of these statements are true. So, that means 6 is a solution to this

14
00:00:55,592 --> 00:00:59,815
compound inequality. Notice that for equations and inequalities, we've always

15
00:00:59,827 --> 00:01:03,925
been able to check our answer. This is what so great, we can know that we're

16
00:01:03,937 --> 00:01:08,150
right. Checking your answer can build your confidence in knowing that you're

17
00:01:08,162 --> 00:01:12,455
right. Or it means, hey, maybe I should go back and check my work.
