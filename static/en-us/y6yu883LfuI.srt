For functions, we learn that they have a certain rule. We start with an input,

2
00:00:04,503 --> 00:00:09,147
something mysterious happens, and then, we get an output. This mysterious part

3
00:00:09,147 --> 00:00:13,741
represents the changes we make to go from the input to the output. For example,

4
00:00:13,741 --> 00:00:18,179
if I had an input of 1, I could get an output of 3. Something's happened here.

5
00:00:18,179 --> 00:00:22,922
You might have thought that I just added 2 to the number. Well, here's some

6
00:00:22,922 --> 00:00:29,101
other inputs. If I put in a 2, I get out a 5. And if I put in a 3, I get out a

7
00:00:29,101 --> 00:00:35,261
7. So the question is, what's happening to our inputs? So, based on these inputs

8
00:00:35,261 --> 00:00:41,134
and outputs, what rule or expression could we write for this function? If I put

9
00:00:41,134 --> 00:00:46,633
in x, I would get out y. What are we doing to x? That's the rule I want you to

10
00:00:46,633 --> 00:00:47,560
write here.
