1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,410
I believe it's displays document.

2
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:06,033
Is that the, that's the invariant
that when it's held to be

3
00:00:06,033 --> 00:00:08,876
true showing us the correct
sequence in lines so

4
00:00:08,876 --> 00:00:11,875
that's going to be broken
as soon as we move the bar.

5
00:00:11,875 --> 00:00:12,860
>> So we move the bar.

6
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:15,650
Remember the direct effect
was that the bar moves.

7
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:20,120
But if our system has any meaning at
all that does what we expect it to do,

8
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,630
it better be the case
we see different lines.

9
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:26,100
Okay, and we've already decided that
the components have responsibility for

10
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:29,051
dealing into that and in particular
here the view port component has

11
00:00:29,051 --> 00:00:31,250
responsibility for dealing with that.

12
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:33,275
Although it's going to have to
interact with the other components.

13
00:00:33,275 --> 00:00:34,215
>> Right.

14
00:00:34,215 --> 00:00:34,795
>> Okay.

15
00:00:34,795 --> 00:00:38,020
So that's the job
the implementation has to do.

16
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:42,560
When the user scrolls, the event causes
a move handle method to be invoked.

17
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:46,505
Move handle causes the value of the
handles positions attribute to change.

18
00:00:46,505 --> 00:00:47,805
That's a direct effect.

19
00:00:47,805 --> 00:00:52,125
Because the displace document
constraint refers to handle position,

20
00:00:52,125 --> 00:00:56,475
the value of the view contents
will change as we expected.

21
00:00:56,475 --> 00:00:59,154
Hence the invariant will
have to be re-established.
