1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,237
So now, this is what our term looks like, 5 times 7 times 2 times x times y

2
00:00:04,249 --> 00:00:08,877
times z. Now, this definitely looks different from how our term originally did,

3
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:13,683
but I wouldn't say that it looks less complicated yet. So our goal for this quiz

4
00:00:13,695 --> 00:00:18,134
is to make this look much more simple. So think back to when we were talking

5
00:00:18,146 --> 00:00:22,865
about Grant's gleaming glasses last time. We simplified this term, 11 times 2n

6
00:00:23,122 --> 00:00:27,855
to equal 22n. By using the same idea that we used to come up with that answer,

7
00:00:27,962 --> 00:00:32,695
can you think of a way to simplify this term up here? Try to squish it down as

8
00:00:32,707 --> 00:00:37,505
much as you can, and remember to get rid of any multiplication signs that you

9
00:00:37,517 --> 00:00:39,475
don't think need to be explicit.
