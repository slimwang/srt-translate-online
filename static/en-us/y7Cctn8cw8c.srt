1
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:04,390
You've decided like you need to create
a variable to keep track of score.

2
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:07,250
And for now, that's the only
variable that you're going to need.

3
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:09,900
Now, you might be wondering why
I don't just call this score.

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:13,860
Well, it's because I'm thinking ahead to
a time when I might need to keep track

5
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:15,820
of more than just one score.

6
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:19,860
And, it will be a little bit confusing
if I have a variable named score,

7
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:23,300
and another variable or
five named something else.

8
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:27,400
So, we're going to be very explicit,
and call this score Team A.

9
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:31,780
Now, in a fair basketball game,
both teams start with 0 points.

10
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:33,850
So, when you're creating this variable,

11
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:36,770
I want you to initialize
it with the value 0.

12
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:39,840
Before you get started though,
you should think about this a tiny bit.

13
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,460
For example, should this new variable,
score Team A be a local variable or

14
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:45,940
a global variable.

15
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:48,480
Once you've decided that,
you can go ahead and declare it, and

16
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,530
initialize its value to 0.

17
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:52,830
To make sure you did it correctly,
go ahead and

18
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:56,890
type the code here that you
used to make this variable.

19
00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:01,030
We are looking for the exact spelling
and capitalization shown here, so

20
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:02,080
make sure that you use it.
