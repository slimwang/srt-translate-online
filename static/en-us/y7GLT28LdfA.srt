1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
It's time for the final ingredient, combustion.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Here, we're just looking at one-singled cell at a time. We're treating each cell on its own.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
We're not looking at the neighbors unlike as we did with diffusion and with winds.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
For this singled cell that we're currently looking at,

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
we have to take two different quantities into account.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
The first is the temperature which we already know, it's measured in Kelvin.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
The second is the amount of woods that can be burned.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Actually that should be something like a density of wood to be measured in kg/mÂ².

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
As the combustion goes on in the cell, this density is reduced possibly to 0

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
and in addition we can use this density to model a variation in vegetation.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
In a thick forest, the value of this density goes up and at a location

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
at which there's a clearing, the value of this density goes down.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Now, we have to distinguish between two different cases.

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
First, the temperature is below the ignition temperature

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
which is something between 500 and 600 K.

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Second, the temperature is above the ignition temperature.

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Let me put an equal sign in here to really cover all possible cases

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,000
even though in reality of this temperature, they'll never be exactly equal to that ignition temperature.

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,000
When we are below that point of ignition, the amount of wood does not change. It's not burning.

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
No heat is being produced because there is no combustion.

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Later on of course, the temperature is going to change through diffusion, through wind,

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
and through heat loss but at the moment, I'm just looking at combustion.

23
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
In the second case, we do have combustion.

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Wood is burning so the rate of change of wood with respect to time has to be negative.

25
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
That's called the burn rate and the simple model for the burn rate

26
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
would be to say that it's proportional to the current amount of wood.

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
The more wood we have, the more we burn and we introduce

28
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
a time constant for the burning that's called tB

29
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
The larger this time constant is, the smaller the burn rate is, the less we burn.

30
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,000
This time constant describes so to speak the time it takes to burn a specific amount of wood.

31
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Now we have to think about temperature.

32
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
In the second case, wood is burning so the temperature should be increasing

33
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
and that should be proportional to that burn rate.

34
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
We need some proportionality constant in here versus something like the heating value

35
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
converting from an amount of wood to an increase in temperature.

36
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
This is our simple model of combustion.

37
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Now let's add the effect of heat loss in all equations about the rate of change of the temperature.

38
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:50,000
We need to include heat loss which is + T amb-T/tHL for that heat loss

39
00:02:50,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and the same when there's combustion going on plus Tamb-T/tHL
