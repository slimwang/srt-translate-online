1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,080
Quiz time, suppose you were
given a linear network of nodes.

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,030
I claim you can add one
link to this network, and

3
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:09,850
reduce its diameter by
roughly a factor of 2.

4
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:12,090
I want you to add this link.

5
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:16,000
To add a link, just pick the two
nodes that represent the endpoint.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,230
For example,
if you think the link between 2 and

7
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:23,724
3 will cut the diameter in half,
then just click on 2 and click on 3.
