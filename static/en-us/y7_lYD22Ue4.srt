00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,640
Let's do now a quiz on how control

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:06,520
dependencies affect the CPI of a pipeline. Let's say

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:09,350
that 25% of all of the instructions we

4
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:12,660
execute are taken branches and jumps. Let's say we

5
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:16,160
have a ten-stage pipeline. Let's say that the

6
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,520
correct taken address for branches and jumps is computed

7
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,375
in the sixth stage of that pipeline. And let's

8
00:00:22,375 --> 00:00:25,315
say that everything else flows smoothly so the CPI

9
00:00:25,315 --> 00:00:29,696
would be one, if not for the taken branches. The question for you

10
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:34,120
is, what is the actual CPI in light of there being taken branches?
