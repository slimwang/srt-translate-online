1
00:00:00,239 --> 00:00:03,313
The answer is we have more transistors available for computation.

2
00:00:03,313 --> 00:00:05,444
We're not clocking things any faster.

3
00:00:05,444 --> 00:00:07,064
Clock rates are remaining constant.

4
00:00:07,064 --> 00:00:10,616
The reason we're getting faster is that we get more and more transistors

5
00:00:10,616 --> 00:00:13,851
available on a processor die with every generation.
