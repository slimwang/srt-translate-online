1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,540
All right Charles, what do you think
I was looking for on this one?

2
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:03,890
>> Okay, so highest expected payoff?

3
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:08,440
Well that's pretty easy in this case,
because they all have the same payoff,

4
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:11,030
maximum payoff of one,
and minimum payoff of 0.

5
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:14,750
So I really just want the one that has
the highest probability of coming up

6
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:16,020
with a 1.

7
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:17,660
And you did me a really cool favor,

8
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:20,490
of making each denominator easily
divisible by its numerator.

9
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:26,156
So I could rattle off the probabilities
of each of those and they are one-tenth,

10
00:00:26,156 --> 00:00:32,259
one-tenth, one-tenth, one-fifth,
one-fifth, one-fifth and one-fifth.

11
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:37,087
So one-fifth is bigger than one-tenth so
I could put anything of d, e, f, or

12
00:00:37,087 --> 00:00:38,480
g in the first box.

13
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,090
>> Good, okay so that was in
some sense not that interesting.

14
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:48,030
So if you had put g just because 8
is bigger than all the other things,

15
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:51,140
that would have been a right answer but
not for the right reason.

16
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:51,680
>> That's right.
>> So

17
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,120
you really do want to compute
what those ratios are.

18
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,760
>> Right and speaking of for
the right reason,

19
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,728
I think that's what your question
most confident sort of comes from.

20
00:00:59,728 --> 00:01:03,910
And I'm just simply going to claim,
without writing equations,

21
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:08,559
that when it comes to understanding
expectations, your confidence is

22
00:01:08,559 --> 00:01:12,750
a monotonically increasing
function of the number of samples.

23
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:17,300
So whichever has the biggest denominator
should be the thing that I'm most

24
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:20,060
confident in because that means
I've seen the most samples.

25
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:21,630
So that would be c and g.

26
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:24,100
Either of them.

27
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:27,240
>> Yeah, okay and in particular, I
wanted you to think about the fact that

28
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:30,110
a and c, even though they have
the same expected payoff,

29
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:34,770
scene 1 out of 10 are estimate of what
the actual payoff here is going to be

30
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:38,760
much less certain than if we did it 40
times and saw that it was 4 out of 40.

31
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:41,290
This is going to be
a more accurate estimate.

32
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:42,490
And so as you say,

33
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:46,400
the confidence is going to increase
monotonically with the denominator.

34
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:51,130
The more data that we've got the more we
believe our estimate based on the data.

35
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:53,675
>> Right.
So if I were to combine those two things

36
00:01:53,675 --> 00:01:59,105
and I and I just now had to do a bandit,
I guess I would pick g,

37
00:01:59,105 --> 00:02:03,415
because it has the highest expected
payoff and I'm most confident in it.

38
00:02:03,415 --> 00:02:04,775
>> Well, that would be one thing to do.

39
00:02:04,775 --> 00:02:06,875
And let's talk about why
that could be problematic.
