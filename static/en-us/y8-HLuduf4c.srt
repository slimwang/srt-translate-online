00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,042
They said that the square root of a negative number belonged outside of the

2
00:00:04,042 --> 00:00:08,320
portion of diagram that contains the real numbers. So in this area over here.

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,346
And since we don't have a name for the type of numbers right now, we need to

4
00:00:12,346 --> 00:00:16,678
come up with one. And since these numbers are real numbers. You might as well

5
00:00:16,678 --> 00:00:20,638
call these numbers imaginary numbers, since they're not real. I think this is a

6
00:00:20,638 --> 00:00:24,702
pretty cool term. It's hard to even think about what the number that's imaginary

7
00:00:24,702 --> 00:00:28,474
means, or what it really is. We'll get a handle on this soon enough. For now

8
00:00:28,474 --> 00:00:32,543
though, let's talk about the simplest imaginary number we have. Well in my mind

9
00:00:32,543 --> 00:00:36,610
the simplest negative number I can think of is negative 1. The number related to

10
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:40,292
this that we're interested in then, is the square root of negative 1. Now

11
00:00:40,292 --> 00:00:44,012
because this is the simplest of that new type of numbers that we're talking

12
00:00:44,012 --> 00:00:48,430
about; the imaginary numbers, it gets a special name. It gets its own letter, i,

13
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:52,735
because it's the simplest imaginary number. Note that even though this is a

14
00:00:52,735 --> 00:00:57,345
letter representing a number, this is not a variable. It's a constant. Just like

15
00:00:57,345 --> 00:01:01,485
we have numbers like pi and e that also have letters going along with, with

16
00:01:01,485 --> 00:01:06,159
them. I is just representing the constant, the square root of -1.. So let's play

17
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:10,651
around with I a little bit. Since we know that i is just a number, albeit, a new

18
00:01:10,651 --> 00:01:14,756
kind of number, but still just a number. We should be able to take it to

19
00:01:14,756 --> 00:01:19,248
different powers. For each of these, I'd like you to write in what number you

20
00:01:19,248 --> 00:01:23,674
think it's equal to. So what is i to the 0, what is i to the 1, what is i to the

21
00:01:23,674 --> 00:01:28,284
2, etc. Now of course, since I is an imaginary number, we would assume that some

22
00:01:28,284 --> 00:01:32,837
of these answers at least, will be imaginary numbers as well. So I itself will

23
00:01:32,837 --> 00:01:37,492
probably appear somewhere in here. Remember though, that because this is just

24
00:01:37,492 --> 00:01:42,056
another number exponents work with it in exactly the same way. I to the five is

25
00:01:42,056 --> 00:01:47,062
just equal to I times itself five. Times. Or 5 i's multiplied together. I think

26
00:01:47,062 --> 00:01:52,096
you might see something interesting happen when you do these. Also 1 last note.

27
00:01:52,096 --> 00:01:56,880
If you ever feel tempted to write the square root of 1, just write i instead.
