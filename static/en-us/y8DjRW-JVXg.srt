00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,230
This lesson introduced some of the more advanced compiler techniques that

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:09,480
help produce programs that work better with the branch predicted, out of order,

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:13,570
multiple instruction per cycle processors that we have today.

4
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:16,980
In the next lesson, we will look at the type of the processor that

5
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:21,260
simplifies its hardware by relying more on such compiler support.
