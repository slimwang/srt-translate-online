00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:02,161
Before we do some exercises,

2
00:00:02,161 --> 00:00:05,321
I want you to go back to Xcode and
open up the Maze project.

3
00:00:05,321 --> 00:00:09,815
Once you have it open, I want you
to navigate to the Move.swift file.

4
00:00:09,815 --> 00:00:17,525
It's located under Maze &gt; UnderTheHood
&gt; MazeMoves, and then Move.swift.

5
00:00:17,525 --> 00:00:19,093
This is where we describe
the Move struct.

6
00:00:19,093 --> 00:00:24,525
But it's just a single file, and
that seems a little confusing.

7
00:00:24,525 --> 00:00:27,110
Since the robot is
moving more than once,

8
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:32,520
don't we need more than one Move struct,
or more than one Move.swift file?

9
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,390
The answer is no.

10
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:38,110
Think back to the analogies we used,
like engine blueprints.

11
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:41,590
In the blueprints, a particular
component was defined only once.

12
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:44,801
But actual instances of the component
will physically exist in tens and

13
00:00:44,801 --> 00:00:46,205
thousands of actual engines.

14
00:00:46,205 --> 00:00:48,930
And that's what this file is.

15
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:51,370
It's like the blueprint for
the Move struct.

16
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:55,427
We create this single blueprint, as we
can see here in the Move.swift file, and

17
00:00:55,427 --> 00:00:59,081
then we can create many instances of
the Move struct in our application.

18
00:00:59,081 --> 00:01:04,959
In programming lingo,
we'd call this blueprint a definition.

19
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:09,430
Or we would say that in the Move.swift
file, we define the Move struct.
