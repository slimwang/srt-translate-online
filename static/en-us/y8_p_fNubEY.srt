00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:02,660
I've talked about eyes and cameras and how they

2
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:06,220
both work. The eye is part of our visual system.

3
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:09,100
The brain interprets what the eye sees. How is

4
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:11,850
this visual system different than how a camera produces an

5
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:14,780
image on its film or sensors? In other words,

6
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:18,550
how does our brain interpret what the eye itself records?

7
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:21,345
Is it that the eye's sharpness changed with lenses?

8
00:00:21,345 --> 00:00:25,690
Bright light can blind us? We can control what our

9
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:30,360
eyes focus on? Or we see images correct side up not upside down?
