1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,090
The first statement, bots have
more sophisticated communication

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:05,910
capabilities, than worms and viruses.

3
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:07,250
This statement is true.

4
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:10,010
In fact, the ability to perform C&C, or

5
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:14,480
command control, is how we distinguish
bots from worms and viruses.

6
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:18,000
The second statement, bots require
direct communication with the C&C

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,840
server, before beginning an attack.

8
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:24,530
This actually is false,
because bots may include

9
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:29,340
conditions such as those based on
a specific time to launch an attack,

10
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:32,470
without the need to
communicate with a C&C server.

11
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:35,960
The third statement,
a botnet will be less likely to be found

12
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:39,400
if it uses custom
communication protocols.

13
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:40,980
This is false.

14
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:45,490
A custom communication protocol means
that it is a unique protocol and

15
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:49,070
therefore it can stand out from
normal traffic quite easily.

16
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:52,680
That is, if a botnet uses
a custom communication protocol,

17
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,610
it is actually more
likely to be detected.
