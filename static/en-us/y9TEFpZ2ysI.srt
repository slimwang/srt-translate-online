1
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:03,780
Well that's it for the four plus one views, but

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:08,780
I think there are some other views which are sometimes useful in understanding,

3
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:10,830
or conveying your understanding,

4
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:14,350
of a system that you're trying to build at the architectural level.

5
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:18,140
One that I've found quite useful is a feature view.

6
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:26,280
A feature is a conceptual unit of system behavior from the user's point of view.

7
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:32,689
Your camera has a zooming feature available to it.

8
00:00:32,689 --> 00:00:34,150
Or maybe it doesn't, okay?

9
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:38,547
Typically, features are something which manufacturers provide as options,

10
00:00:38,547 --> 00:00:41,450
that you may have to pay extra for.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,740
Feature modeling is used for describing a set of features that

12
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:54,380
a a collection of related applications provide.

13
00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:58,800
There's feature diagram, which I'm going to show you in a second,

14
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,580
that conveys the set of possible features that might be

15
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:06,220
configured into a particular product in that set of products.

16
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:09,000
The diagram is graphical.

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,150
It has icons and so on, but it can also have intra-feature constrains which

18
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:15,170
aren't shown in this particular diagram.

19
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:19,160
Here's a particular feature diagram showing the features of a car.

20
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:25,030
At the top is the, what's called the concept or the main

21
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:31,080
manufactured item and then under it are its features.

22
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:34,860
So the car, this particular car has four features.

23
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:35,360
Okay.

24
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,360
Three of the features are required.

25
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,730
The body, the transmission, and engine.

26
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:42,740
And whether or not it pulls trailer is optional.

27
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:46,460
Whether it's required or optional is indicated by the little circle at

28
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:50,860
the end of arc connecting cart to its features.

29
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:54,490
If the circle is filled in it's a required feature, and

30
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:56,370
if it's open; then it's an optional feature.

31
00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:00,390
Features can have sub-features.

32
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:04,060
So, a transition sorry, a transmission can have

33
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:09,150
an automatic transmission feature, or a manual transmission feature.

34
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:13,820
The or that I just said, is indicated by that open arc connecting those

35
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:15,750
two lines coming out of the transition.

36
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,830
Similarly there are two kinds of engines, electrical and gasoline.

37
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:22,740
In this case the arc is filled in though,

38
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:24,950
indicating that you can have a combination.

39
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:26,890
That is you can have a hybrid engine.

40
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:34,520
We could imagine a constraint here going between automatic transmission and

41
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:38,590
pulls trailer, saying that the pulls trailer option is only available if

42
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:41,580
you have the automatic transmission and not the manual transmission.
