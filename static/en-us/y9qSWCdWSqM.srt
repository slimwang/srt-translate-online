00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:04,620
Let's say you want to write a program
that wishes your cat a happy birthday.

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:08,480
If you tried to run this code,
you probably go this ugly error message.

3
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:11,980
No worries, let's search for it.

4
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:16,900
Man, it says no results found.

5
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:18,710
So I guess I can't fix the problem.

6
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:20,630
Just kidding.

7
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:22,980
Let's try searching more effectively.

8
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:26,675
The first part of the error message
tells you the name of the file,

9
00:00:26,675 --> 00:00:33,940
birthday.rb, the line number where
the error might be, which is line 2,

10
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:38,990
and the name of the method that the
error might be in, say_happy_birthday.

11
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:42,980
This information is useful for helping
you pinpoint where the error message is,

12
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:46,830
but searching for these things won't
help, since everyone's specific file and

13
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:48,830
method names will be different.

14
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:52,470
Not everyone will call
their file birthday.rb.

15
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:54,020
Here's the more useful information.

16
00:00:55,080 --> 00:01:00,980
Undefined local variable or
method and NameError.

17
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:01,610
These words and

18
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:05,300
phrases describe the error rather
than the happy birthday program.

19
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,000
Let's try searching for these keywords.

20
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,580
Nice, a lot of search results.

21
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:17,800
There are a couple Stack Overflow posts,
a link to the Ruby docs, and a tutorial.

22
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:21,095
Let's look at the official
documentation first.

23
00:01:21,095 --> 00:01:23,360
Hm.

24
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,140
Depending on how much background
knowledge you have, this may or

25
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:28,010
may not mean much to you.

26
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:32,200
The language is very technical and
it doesn't really explain how to fix it.

27
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:32,700
Let's go back.

28
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,855
How about we try this tutorial instead?

29
00:01:35,855 --> 00:01:38,600
Hm.

30
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,810
I think we found what we're looking for.

31
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:43,960
It's telling us that we use
the variable, in this case,

32
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:47,260
birthday, without assigning
it to a value first.

33
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,083
So let's go do it.

34
00:01:49,083 --> 00:01:52,697
And we could re-run the program.

35
00:01:52,697 --> 00:01:54,502
Nice, it works.
