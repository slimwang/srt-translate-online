1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
In this problem, you will be given intercepted messages

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
from a Diffie-Hellman exchange between two people,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
including p--a large prime number, g--a generator, g of a mod p

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
where a is Alice's private key, g of b mod p where b is Bob's private key,

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
a message which has been encoded with g of a * b mod p as the key.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
You will also be given timing information from the modular exponentiation

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
as described in a previous question.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Your job will be to use the side channel to determine the key and decode the message.
