1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,280
Now let's do some more
processing on the data frame.

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:07,480
We can start with finding
the maximum closing value for

3
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:10,640
each of the stock AAPL and IBM.

4
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:11,910
So here's the code.

5
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:17,679
The test_run function simply loops
over two symbols, AAPL and IBM,

6
00:00:17,679 --> 00:00:23,390
and will print the maximum closing
value of each of the stock.

7
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:27,910
Let's call the function
get_max_close along with the symbol.

8
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:31,700
Here's the function that will
compute the maximum closing value.

9
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:35,210
Let's see what get_max_close
function does.

10
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:39,800
The first step would be to read
in the csv into the data frame.

11
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:43,740
The next step would be to get only
the closing values from the entire

12
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:48,120
data frame, which means we have
to extract the column close.

13
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,500
This is how you do it.

14
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:56,440
df[, pass the parameter of
the column name, that is, 'Close'.

15
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:59,870
Make sure you include
the inverted commas.

16
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:03,410
The last step is to calculate
the maximum value, and

17
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:09,080
it is as simple as calling the .max()
function over the extracted data.

18
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:11,490
Let's go ahead and print this.

19
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:13,100
Here is your output.

20
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:18,068
The max close for the AAPL is 680.44 and

21
00:01:18,068 --> 00:01:22,520
the max close for the IBM is 209.5.
