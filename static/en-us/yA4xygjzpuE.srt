1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:02,830
Well Laura we've heard all
about current care from you and

2
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:06,450
others here at
the Rhode Island Quality Institute, but

3
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:11,240
I want to come back to you and
let's look out in the future.

4
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:16,219
What is the future of current care and
of HIE and is there anything that you

5
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:18,760
really want our students to
take away from this interview?

6
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:23,750
>> I think that HIEs have focused
historically on providing information

7
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:28,660
to physicians, hospitals, providers,
long term care and so forth.

8
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:29,830
By the time they see this,

9
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:34,020
we're going to be turning the power of
the HIE toward consumers and people.

10
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:38,360
We know from McGuinness' research that
in terms of the greatest predictors of

11
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:42,690
morbidity and mortality,
our health care system is only 10%.

12
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:46,930
We're 85% of where the money is spent
but it's only 10% of the impact.

13
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:49,960
More and more care is
migrating out of the hospital,

14
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:53,400
out of primary care doctors offices
into the community and into the home.

15
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:57,640
So, we are busy building
an opportunity for patients to

16
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:02,130
look directly into their current care
record, to upload their own information,

17
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:05,980
be it biometrics that they're wearing an
embedded to manage their blood pressure.

18
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:09,430
Or their measure their glucose or
their Fitbit, or

19
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:11,750
whatever device they're wearing.

20
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:16,230
We know that when we go to Appapalooza
events, the inventors get up and

21
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:19,980
say we have the coolest app since sliced
bread, and the greatest thing about it,

22
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:23,040
we're going to be able to send your
data directly to your doctors.

23
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,628
We know the doctors in the audience
are going [SOUND] I can't take

24
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:28,194
in data from every device.

25
00:01:28,194 --> 00:01:32,371
We can take in data, we can organize
it and we can use direct to alert

26
00:01:32,371 --> 00:01:37,760
physicians when something is going on in
the home that they need to know about.

27
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:40,060
Where on, if they act upon that,

28
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:43,410
then they can prevent an admission, they
can prevent a patient with congestive

29
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:47,120
heart failure picks up seven pounds in
two days, we'll alert your care manager.

30
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,600
That patient will home with
their family on Friday night and

31
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,930
not drowning in their
own fluids in an ED.

32
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:56,220
So I think it's that idea of beginning
to look at the quantified self,

33
00:01:56,220 --> 00:02:00,010
mobile health, and
how HIEs will begin to integrate

34
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:04,470
that information into that record so
it is all one comprehensive record.

35
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:07,140
Problem with a lot of mobile
health right now is it definitely

36
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:10,479
collects your data and it sends it
up to your mobile health platform,

37
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,300
not integrated with anything else.

38
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:17,130
So I think it's that, and the idea that
we will use direct in the future because

39
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:22,640
while I may want my 70-year-old mother
to use the current care platform,

40
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,540
my guess is that she
won't be using that.

41
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:27,010
I'll want a proxy message to come to me.

42
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:31,340
And so I will want an alert from
our hospitals that tell me,

43
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:35,040
your mom just got admitted to an ED,
because my mom lives in Colorado and

44
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,880
I live in Massachusetts and
Rhode Island.

45
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:39,390
So, I'm going to want an alert.

46
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:43,030
>> So it sounds like any physicians
out there watching this interview and

47
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:46,280
worried about meeting the VDT
requirements of meaningful use stage

48
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:49,020
two, should just pack their bags and
move to Rhode Island.

49
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:49,810
You're going to do it for them.

50
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:50,370
>> We'd love it.

51
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:54,410
Because with our portal we do have the
view download and transmit capability.

52
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:59,110
And so we're, give the ability for
someone to get their complete

53
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:01,510
longitudinal record and
current care in the PDF form.

54
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:06,560
They can put it on a USB drive, they can
email it to their daughter, whatever.

55
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,250
>> Well, thank you so much.

56
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:07,760
>> My pleasure.

57
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,996
>> I appreciate your allowing us
to come up today, talk to you and

58
00:03:09,996 --> 00:03:10,760
some of your stuff.

59
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,350
Thank you.

60
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:12,000
>> It's been a pleasure.

61
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,500
Thank you.
