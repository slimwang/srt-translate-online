1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The answer to this is actually N-1.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
So in the worst case, it still has to look through N-1 iterations,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
which is not really any better than any of our other algorithms.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
And let's take a look at an example of why that is.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
So let's say we have this star-shaped graph,

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
and we can see that there is a single

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
vertex cover that is better than any of the others.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
That is you pick this vertex in the middle,

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
and that automatically covers every single edge,

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
and no other possible vertex cover is going to be as good.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
So with our randomized algorithm, let's say that we pick an edge at random.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Let's say we pick this one,

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
and then we have to pick one of the two endpoints randomly.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Now let's say we pick this one and add it to the cover.

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Well then we've only covered this edge,

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
and then we start over and reiterate.

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
And let's say we pick edges at random,

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
and each time we pick the outer vertex.

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
It's unlikely, but it can happen.

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Now if we do that, then we've had to go through N-1 iterations to get a cover,

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
and we are going to get a not great cover either.

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Now if we do this, you can see that

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
we've had to go through N-1 iterations to find this cover,

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
and it has a remotely close to the K equal 1 cover

25
00:01:20,000 --> 99:59:59,999
that is actually optimal in this case.
