00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,270
You have noticed visually that the key difference

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:07,780
was, the red line was replaced by a dotted

3
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:11,970
line, separating the application from the operating system.

4
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:14,520
And what you get out of that is performance.

5
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:16,960
Access to system services are going to be like

6
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,645
a procedure call, and what is lost in the

7
00:00:19,645 --> 00:00:22,500
DOS-like structure is the fact that you don't

8
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:26,420
have protection. Of the operating system from the application.

9
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:29,860
An errant application can corrupt the operating system.

10
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:32,549
We'll elaborate on this in the next few panels.
