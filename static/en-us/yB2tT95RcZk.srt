1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,041
All right,
welcome back to computer vision.

2
00:00:02,041 --> 00:00:05,890
We're going to continue introducing
particle filters for tracking.

3
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:09,491
I also want to say thank you I
think it's Sebastian Thrun and,

4
00:00:09,491 --> 00:00:13,770
and/or Dieter Fox or somebody else
who's done a bunch of slides that have

5
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:17,280
actually lost their, their authorship
is lost to all of humanity.

6
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:19,480
Because if you take a look
at particle filtering,

7
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:21,270
you'll see these same
pictures everywhere.

8
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:23,680
So whoever did them, thanks.

9
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,290
All right, so you remember I hope,

10
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:30,360
that the reason we're doing all this is
because unlike Kalman filter where we

11
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:34,100
were going to represent the densities to
where things are, are the nice Gaussian.

12
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:36,870
The idea is we might want to
have an arbitrary density.

13
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,750
And graphically, this,
that's what's shown here,

14
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:43,660
the idea of propagating
a density through time.

15
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:46,600
Now, the basic idea that we're
going to make use of is instead of

16
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:50,070
having some sort of analytic
representation of our densities,

17
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:51,970
we're going to have
these set of particles.

18
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:54,800
We've talked before about how
the distribution in terms of

19
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,520
where the particles are and
perhaps the weight of the particles.

20
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,630
That's what we're going to
substitute for the density.

21
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:01,790
Right?
And our goal is, so

22
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:03,820
that as we're doing this tracking,

23
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:07,480
eventually we have a set of particles
such that the probability that you get

24
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:11,440
a particle at some particular place
is essentially the probability

25
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:17,050
that the state is actually at that place
having observed all the observations.

26
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:19,750
And the way we do this is we're
going to do this as a Bayes filter.

27
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:21,820
We introduced this last time,

28
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:26,580
where we said that basically you
take your prediction from before.

29
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:28,620
And the way you get to
your prediction is,

30
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:32,540
you take your previous belief of all
the different places you might be.

31
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:37,380
And talk about the probability that you
could end up at some given xt, you some

32
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:42,605
that all up, and that's your prior
belief that you could be at xt.

33
00:01:42,605 --> 00:01:46,265
You take your measurement,
you multiply it by your likelihood and

34
00:01:46,265 --> 00:01:50,138
because of Bayes rules which does the,
the swapping of the variables,

35
00:01:50,138 --> 00:01:52,995
that gives us our new belief about xt.

36
00:01:52,995 --> 00:01:54,580
So we're going to take particles and

37
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:57,780
we're going to define a Bayes
filter using those particles.
