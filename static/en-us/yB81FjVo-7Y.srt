00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,399
If we take a closer look at the slopes, we can see that these slopes are

2
00:00:03,399 --> 00:00:08,568
actually reciprocals of one another and opposite in sign. The slopes of

3
00:00:08,568 --> 00:00:12,724
perpendicular lines are always opposite reciprocals of each other. The

4
00:00:12,724 --> 00:00:16,398
reciprocal of four thirds is three fourths and then we make it negative. We

5
00:00:16,398 --> 00:00:19,304
change the sign. Now that we know a little bit more about parallel and

6
00:00:19,304 --> 00:00:22,460
perpendicular lines, let's put this knowledge to use.
