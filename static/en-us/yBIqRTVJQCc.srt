00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:01,177
The answer?

2
00:00:01,177 --> 00:00:03,615
And this is pretty particular to sorting networks,

3
00:00:03,615 --> 00:00:06,709
but with a sorting network all will take the same amount of time.

4
00:00:06,709 --> 00:00:10,311
It's an important consequence of an oblivious sorting algorithm.

5
00:00:10,311 --> 00:00:13,947
Any input will require the same amount of time to sort.
