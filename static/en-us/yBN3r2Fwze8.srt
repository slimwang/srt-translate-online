00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:03,580
The next step in this password hashing adventure is to implement this function

2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:06,320
called make password hash, make_pw_hash. Takes a

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:08,680
name and a password, and it returns

4
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:14,130
a hash of the name, password, and salt, concatenated, plus the salt. Separated

5
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:19,180
by a comma, I'd like you to use sha256 so, okay. Go ahead, good luck.
