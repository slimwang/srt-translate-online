1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,250
Here's how I figured out the answer.

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:05,590
I started with this node here,
and I noticed that there

3
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:10,980
were 3 plus 1 units coming in, so
there must be 4 units going out.

4
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:14,960
Looking at this node down here, I
observe that 10 units are coming in, so

5
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,230
10 units need to come out.

6
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:22,220
There are two unknown flows going out,
but the capacities are 6 and

7
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:25,930
4, respectively, for
a total of 10 capacity.

8
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:28,030
This means that there's no ambiguity.

9
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:30,900
Both edges must be used
to their full capacity.

10
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:33,400
That is to say, that they are saturated.

11
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,690
Finally that leaves me with this edge.

12
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:40,228
We have 4 plus 6 coming in,
and 2 units going out already,

13
00:00:40,228 --> 00:00:45,240
meaning that 8 more units must
go out flowing along this edge.

14
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:49,128
And I can check my work at the end by
confirming that the amount coming out of

15
00:00:49,128 --> 00:00:49,818
the source,

16
00:00:49,818 --> 00:00:54,470
12 units in this case, is the same
amount that's going into the sink.

17
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:54,970
Perfect.
