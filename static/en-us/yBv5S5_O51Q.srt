00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:01,140
Here's a quiz.

2
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:05,470
Assume we want to determine the components of a software system based solely on

3
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:06,820
an analysis model.

4
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:12,320
Given this situation, mark each text box below either true or false.

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:17,390
First box, analysis models can adapt well to changes in customer requirements.

6
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:18,200
Second question,

7
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:22,430
analysis models should represent the approach that will be taken in design.

8
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:26,220
Third, analysis models are resilient to changes in hardware.

9
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:30,050
Fourth question, analysis models include all components required by a system.
