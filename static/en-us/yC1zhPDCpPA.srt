1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,340
So I think we'll see zero to nine appear.

2
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:07,800
Wait a second, this is actually i is less than nine, so

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:12,210
it's going to exit the loop when i is equal to nine.

4
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:16,730
So it actually will show zero through eight and there it is.
