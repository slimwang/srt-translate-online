00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,210
The question I would now like you to think about for a moment and this is going to be

2
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:10,690
our next quiz is if you have a computer problem and you want to know if this problem

3
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:19,190
is tractable or intractable, then I would like you to think about which one is actually harder to show

4
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:22,330
or if it's both equally hard to show.

5
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:29,120
If you think that showing the problem to be tractable is easier than showing it to be intractable,

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:32,610
then I want you to check this circle here.

7
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:39,770
If you think that showing intractability, so showing that a problem belongs here is easier

8
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:44,390
than showing that it belongs here, and I want you to check this circle here.

9
00:00:44,390 --> 99:59:59,999
And finally, if you think it hardly makes any difference, then I want you to check this circle here.
