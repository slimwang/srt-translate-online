1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The answer is 7.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Obviously, -3 plus 10 is 7,

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
-3 plus 5 plus 5 is 7,

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
-3 plus 5 plus 3 plus 2 is 7.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
All of those work out to be 7. We have a fully consistent situation.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 99:59:59,999
The landmark seems to be consistently seen. There seems to be no noise whatsoever.
