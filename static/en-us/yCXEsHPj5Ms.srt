00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,597
Up to this point, we've been working with opaque materials. Where light hits the

2
00:00:03,597 --> 00:00:07,785
surface, and bounces off. For a number of reasons, transparent objects are more

3
00:00:07,785 --> 00:00:12,314
challenging. First, light refracts, and so changes its direction when it hits a

4
00:00:12,314 --> 00:00:16,652
transparent surface. For example, here light comes from the surface of the

5
00:00:16,652 --> 00:00:21,068
pencil, travels through water, and hits the glass. The glass causes the light to

6
00:00:21,068 --> 00:00:25,570
go in a different direction. Such the different light rays reach our eyes and

7
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:29,629
cause the pencil to look bent. This change in direction can also affect the

8
00:00:29,629 --> 00:00:34,482
distribution of light on a surface. This crystal ball acts similarly to a lens,

9
00:00:34,482 --> 00:00:39,480
focusing the light and creating various bright spots below it. In computer

10
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:44,225
graphics, we call these bright spots caustics. The color and the intensity of

11
00:00:44,225 --> 00:00:48,478
the light can be filtered by the transparent object. The farther a ray of light

12
00:00:48,478 --> 00:00:52,252
travels through an object, the more light that can be absorbed. Even thin

13
00:00:52,252 --> 00:00:56,848
filters can change the color of the light. All of these effects can be simulated

14
00:00:56,848 --> 00:01:01,698
or at least approximated in a convincing way. Refraction where the light changes

15
00:01:01,698 --> 00:01:06,112
direction is expensive to do correctly. I'll be discussing it further in later

16
00:01:06,112 --> 00:01:10,160
lessons. It's also possible to computer the amount of light absorbed due to

17
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:13,558
traveling through an object, though this can be costly. In the following

18
00:01:13,558 --> 00:01:17,774
lessons, I'm going to focus on absorption of light by thin transparent surfaces,

19
00:01:17,774 --> 00:01:22,082
such as these eyeglass filters. To simplify further still, I'll be talking about

20
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:26,354
only the effect of such filters on objects visible through them. In other words,

21
00:01:26,354 --> 00:01:30,910
I won't be talking about how light passes through such a filter, reaches another

22
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:34,930
surface, and then travels to the eye. I'll only be talking about light that

23
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:38,623
travels from the object through the filter. This all sounds like a lot of

24
00:01:38,623 --> 00:01:42,466
simplification, but you can get wonderful effects from just this form of

25
00:01:42,466 --> 00:01:47,810
filtering alone. For example, this fantastic demo made by Alexander Roddick

26
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:52,732
shows how transparency can be used to effect. There are other cool effects going

27
00:01:52,732 --> 00:01:56,938
on here, such as the God rays of light. But transparency is what really makes

28
00:01:56,938 --> 00:02:06,985
this demo shine. It's 1 of my favorite Web GL programs. .
