00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:01,500
Hi there.

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:03,670
>> Hi, and welcome to our
course on building scaleable

3
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:05,440
applications in Python.

4
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:08,200
>> My name is Magnus, and I work at
Google, with cloud technologies.

5
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:11,010
>> And I'm Karl,
I'm a course developer at Udacity.

6
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:14,290
>> Together we will teach you how
to build great applications that

7
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:15,980
run on Google infrastructure.

8
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:16,900
And that can scale.

9
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:17,630
>> And scale.

10
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:18,480
>> And scale.

11
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,190
>> And scale.

12
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:20,310
>> And scale.

13
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:23,620
>> Because at Google people really do
know how to build scalable systems.

14
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:26,790
>> That's right and after this
course you will also be able to

15
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:30,710
write scalable applications that
run in the Google data centers.

16
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:34,370
I will be teaching you the theory
behind building scalable applications.

17
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:36,790
>> And I'll be showing you how
to implement them in Python.

18
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:39,020
So with that why don't we get
right into our first lesson.
