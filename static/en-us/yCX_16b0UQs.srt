00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:03,472
This could come in handy with something like a temperature conversion. This

2
00:00:03,472 --> 00:00:08,412
equation relates degree Celsius to Fahrenheit. So if I told you that the

3
00:00:08,412 --> 00:00:13,638
temperature was 32 degrees in Fahrenheit, then you could quickly plug that in to

4
00:00:13,638 --> 00:00:19,027
tell me that the Celsius would be, well, 0 since 32 minus 32 would equal 0. But

5
00:00:19,027 --> 00:00:23,692
what if I told you the temperature was 32 degrees Celsius. Would you be able to

6
00:00:23,692 --> 00:00:27,405
tell me the degrees Fahrenheit? You could plug in 32 into C and then use your

7
00:00:27,405 --> 00:00:31,500
equation solving skills to figure this out but I wouldn't want to do this work

8
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:36,338
every single time for a new degree Celsius. I want an equation that just has F

9
00:00:36,338 --> 00:00:40,736
solve for. So let's figure that out together. I want you to use your knowledge

10
00:00:40,736 --> 00:00:45,656
of solving equations to solve for F here. Type your final answer in this box.

11
00:00:45,656 --> 00:00:50,693
Remember, the equation here should contain the variables C and F. And since

12
00:00:50,693 --> 00:00:55,150
you're solving for F, your equation should start with F equals. Good luck on

13
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:56,023
this one.
