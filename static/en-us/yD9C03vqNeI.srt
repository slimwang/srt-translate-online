1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:00,930
Now I tricked you,

2
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:04,260
it's actually this line over here and you might have gotten this right.

3
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:08,780
Now this does maximize the margin, in some sense to all the data points.

4
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:11,080
But it makes a classification error.

5
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:14,510
The red x is on the wrong side of the green line.

6
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:17,830
Whereas in this case over here, all the points are classified correctly.

7
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:21,620
Support vector machine puts first and

8
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:25,040
foremost the correct classification of the labels, and then maximize the margin.

9
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:27,990
If we didn't care about correct classification,

10
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:32,350
this line back here has an even larger margin to all the training examples.

11
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:34,280
That's obviously the wrong line.

12
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:38,930
So for support vector machines, you are trying to classify correctly, and

13
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:42,020
subject to that constraint, you maximize the margin.
