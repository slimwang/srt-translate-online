00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,250
Let's continue exploring this idea of using filters as

2
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:07,710
templates of what we want to find in two dimensions.

3
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:08,470
Okay?

4
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:10,510
So a template is a thing that you give me and

5
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:14,180
you say I want you to find something else that looks like this and

6
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:15,830
we're going to do that through a filtering.

7
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:19,990
And here's a nice example courtesy of Christian Grumman as well I believe.

8
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:22,170
Although I'm not sure she made, if that's one these,

9
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:23,930
by the way this is early in the class.

10
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:27,670
You're going to see a lot of slides that have somebody's name next to them,

11
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:29,270
because I've got them, the.

12
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:30,760
And then what I later discovered is,

13
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:33,270
many of these slides came from other people, and from other people.

14
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:36,900
So the name that I put down is the name that I was able to track it towards.

15
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:39,470
And the rest of us on the internet we're just making our way.

16
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:40,150
All right.

17
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:42,170
So, here's a very simple example.

18
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:47,720
So here we have a scene on the left and we've got this template on the right.

19
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:50,510
All right? So this is the think that we want to find.

20
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:51,380
And you look over here and

21
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:54,480
you say, oh I see where it is it's, it's, it's, it's right over here.

22
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,810
So what we would like is our system to spit out something like this.

23
00:00:57,810 --> 00:00:59,830
Say aha, here's my little green box.

24
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:05,900
Well what we can do is we can actually do this through a normalized correlation.

25
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:08,390
If I take that masked kernel template and

26
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:13,790
I do a normalized correlation with the image on the left, what I get is a map or

27
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:15,920
correlation image that looks like this.

28
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:16,620
Okay?

29
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:18,120
And you'll notice.

30
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,450
That, where black lies over black and

31
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:22,560
white lies over white, you can think of that as positive and

32
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,730
negative, so I get some brightness over here and some brightness over here.

33
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:30,030
But my really bright spot is right there

34
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:32,860
because that's the template having landed in the right place.

35
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:37,350
So that's how you use correlation in order to do this detection because now

36
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:40,330
we're thinking of filters not so much as doing an averaging or

37
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:43,700
a blurring but actually being a template that we're looking for.
