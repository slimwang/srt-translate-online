00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:04,629
An evaluation metric that doesn't have this shortcoming is called r squared, and

2
00:00:04,629 --> 00:00:06,651
is a very popular evaluation metric for

3
00:00:06,651 --> 00:00:09,546
describing the goodness of fit of a linear regression.

4
00:00:09,546 --> 00:00:14,958
And, what r squared is, is it's a number that effectively answers the question,

5
00:00:14,958 --> 00:00:19,694
how much of my change in the output is explained by the change in my input?

6
00:00:19,694 --> 00:00:24,830
And, the values that r squared can take on, will be between 0 and 1.

7
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:27,810
If the number is very small, that generally means that

8
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:32,350
your regression line isn't doing a good job of capturing the trend in the data.

9
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:36,120
On the other hand, if r squared is large, close to 1, what that means is

10
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:40,720
your regression line is doing a good job of describing the relationship

11
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:46,420
between your input, or your x variable, and your output, or your y variable.

12
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:49,330
And, remember, this is the whole point of performing a regression,

13
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:53,040
is to come up with a mathematical formula that describes this relationship.

14
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:55,270
So, if your r square is close to 1,

15
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:57,740
it basically means your fit is doing a good job.

16
00:00:57,740 --> 00:00:59,060
The good thing about r squared,

17
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:01,920
is that it's independent of the number of training points.

18
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,500
So, it'll always be between 0 and 1.

19
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,860
In general, it's not affected by the number of points in your data set.

20
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:10,920
So, this is a little bit more reliable than a sum of squared errors.

21
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:14,030
Especially, if the number of points in the data set could

22
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:15,330
potentially be changing.
