1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,540
Let's get started using Tag Manager.

2
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:06,510
The place to go is
tagmanager.google.com.

3
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:08,250
If you already have
a Tag Manger account,

4
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:10,480
you'll see a list of your accounts.

5
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:16,364
But if you don't, you'll see a screen
where you can create an account.

6
00:00:16,364 --> 00:00:21,235
This UI has tabs at the top,
pretty much like the Analytics UI did.

7
00:00:21,235 --> 00:00:23,595
We're currently in the Admin UI.

8
00:00:23,595 --> 00:00:25,255
Enter your account name,

9
00:00:25,255 --> 00:00:28,210
whatever you want your
Tag Manager account to be called.

10
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:30,970
Choose whether you want to share
benchmarking data anonymously.

11
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:34,020
If you opt in, then the data that
you collect through analytics and

12
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:37,610
tag manager will be shared anonymously
and used to create benchmarks,

13
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:40,180
and you'll be able to
see those benchmarks.

14
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:42,250
During testing,
I won't share my data, but

15
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:45,410
later on, my apps when they go
into productions, then I will.

16
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:47,720
Anyway, continue.

17
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:48,738
Set up your container.

18
00:00:48,738 --> 00:00:52,230
Choose Android, obviously.

19
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:53,470
Give it a name.
And

20
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:56,990
we're using this container to
contain our daily specials, so

21
00:00:56,990 --> 00:01:00,040
this name doesn't actually need
to match anything in your code.

22
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:02,370
It's helpful to name your container

23
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:04,209
in a way that helps you
remember what's in it.

24
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:07,000
All right, then Create.

25
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:12,690
Accept the terms and
the container is ready to be used.

26
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:13,925
Ok.
Good with that.

27
00:01:13,925 --> 00:01:16,640
So now I notice that we're
in the Container tab.

28
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:22,550
And up here on the top left, next to the
app name, you'll see your account ID.

29
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:26,320
Okay, take a minute now to create
your Google TagManager account.

30
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,880
Okay, I'm going to redo the quiz.

31
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,970
So go to tagmanager.google.com.

32
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:36,440
Create an account for android obviously.

33
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,090
Create a container.

34
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:40,100
Check the boxes as you go and

35
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:43,980
when you're done, tell us what your
account ID is by entering it here.
