1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:06,480
The first step in the BGP route selection process is to prefer a route with the

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:12,060
higher local preference value. The local preference value is simply a numerical

3
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:18,260
value that a network operator in the local AS can assign to a particular

4
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:21,230
route. This attribute is purely local, it

5
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:25,130
does not get transmitted between autonomous systems,

6
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:27,364
so it is dropped in EBGP route

7
00:00:27,364 --> 00:00:30,830
advertisements. But it allows a local network operator

8
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:34,140
the ability to explicitly state that one

9
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:36,790
route should be preferred over the other. Among

10
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:40,270
routes with equally high local preference values,

11
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:45,020
BGP prefers routes with shorter AS path length.

12
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:50,260
The idea is that a path might be better if it traverses a fewer number of

13
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:53,760
autonomous systems. The third step involves comparison

14
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,020
of multiple routes advertised from the same

15
00:00:57,020 --> 00:01:01,120
autonomous system. The multi-exit discriminator value allows

16
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,150
one AS to specify that one exit

17
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:09,170
point in the network is more preferred than another. So lower MED values are

18
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:12,580
preferred, but this step only applies to

19
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:15,370
compare routes that are advertised from the same

20
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:21,500
autonomous system. Because the neighboring AS sets the MED value on routes that

21
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,740
it advertises to a neighbor, MED

22
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:28,520
values are not inherently comparable across routes

23
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:31,420
advertised from different ASs. Therefore this

24
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:34,270
step only applies to routes advertised from

25
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:37,760
the same AS. Fourth, BGP speaking routers

26
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:40,490
inside an autonomous system will prefer a

27
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:47,780
BGP route with a shorter IGP path cost to the IGP next up. The idea here is

28
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:50,660
that if a router inside an autonomous system

29
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:53,870
learns two routes via IBGP then it wants to

30
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:56,700
prefer the one that results in the shortest

31
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,870
path the to the exit of the network. This

32
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:02,220
behavior results in what is called hot potato routing,

33
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:06,220
where an autonomous system sends traffic to the neigjboring

34
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:09,953
autonomous system via a path that traverses as

35
00:02:09,953 --> 00:02:12,960
little of its own network as possible. Finally, if

36
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:15,880
there are multiple routes with the highest possible local

37
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:19,620
preference, the shortest AS path and the shortest IGP

38
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:22,240
path, the router uses a tiebreak to pick a

39
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:25,320
single breaking route. This tiebreaking step is arbitrary. It

40
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,500
might be the most stable, or the route that's

41
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:31,830
been advertised the longest. But often, to induce determinism,

42
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:34,820
operators typically prefer that this tie breaking step

43
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:37,620
is performed based on the route advertisement from the

44
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:40,560
router with the lowest router ID, which is

45
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,060
typically the neighboring router's IP address. Let's now take

46
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:47,070
a closer look into local preference, AS path

47
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:50,860
length, muli-exit discriminator and hot potato routing. Now as

48
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:52,950
I mentioned the first step in the router

49
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:57,240
selection process is for routers to prefer routes with

50
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,990
higher local preference values. Now an operator can

51
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:03,405
actually set the local preference value on incoming

52
00:03:03,405 --> 00:03:07,140
BGP route advertisements to affect which route a

53
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:09,930
router ultimately selects. Let's see how this works.
