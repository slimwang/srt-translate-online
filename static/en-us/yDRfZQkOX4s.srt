1
00:00:00,005 --> 00:00:05,370
Here, the hypotenuse is 30 inches. Great work if you found this number. We'll

2
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:11,390
start with a right triangle, with side lengths 18 inches and 24 inches. We'll

3
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:15,360
use x for the length of the hypotenuse since that's what we're finding. Now we

4
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,560
just plug into the Pythagorean theorem, squaring the legs, and squaring our

5
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:24,880
unknown hypotenuse length. When we square 18, we get 324. And when we square

6
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:31,379
24, we get 576. The sum of these equals 900. And no we can take the square root

7
00:00:31,379 --> 00:00:35,841
of both sides to solve for x. Here, we'll keep the positive root only, since

8
00:00:35,841 --> 00:00:41,300
we're talking about distance. The length that this hypotenuse is 30 inches.

9
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:45,080
This triangle is actually a special right triangle with side lengths in the

10
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:49,350
ratio of 3 to 4 to 5. So, we can actually use this to help us solve for x

11
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:55,898
without using the Pythagorean Theorem. If we multiply 3 by 6, we'll get 18. And

12
00:00:55,898 --> 00:01:01,478
if we multiple 4 by 6 we'll get 24. This means to find this unknown hypotneuse

13
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:08,180
we multiple the hypotneuse by 5 by our same multipler 6. We multiple 5 times 6

14
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:15,214
we'll get 30. Now not every right triangle will be so special. In this case it

15
00:01:15,214 --> 00:01:21,124
was since these side lengths were in the ratio of 3 to 4 to 5. This is why we

16
00:01:21,124 --> 00:01:24,720
looked at those Pythagorean triples earlier. Sometimes they can help us problem

17
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:31,674
solve more quickly. But either way we solve we'll still get a hypotenuse of 30.
