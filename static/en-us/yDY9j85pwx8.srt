Hi, and welcome to lesson four. Conference central is

2
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:07,510
starting to look like an interesting application. In addition to

3
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:10,090
user management that we introduced in lesson two, we

4
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:13,980
also added data store in lesson three. Now it's time

5
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:17,060
to look at data relationships and how to retrieve

6
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:20,760
data and make no mistake about it. There's a lot

7
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,110
of moving parts with respect to this. So you

8
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:26,021
better keep your eye on the ball. [SOUND] In addition

9
00:00:26,021 --> 00:00:32,159
to data relationships and queries, we will be looking at datastore

10
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:38,561
consistency rules and transactions in this lesson. Now is probably a good time

11
00:00:38,561 --> 00:00:42,839
to seriously start to checkout the documentation on the internet as well

12
00:00:42,839 --> 00:00:44,592
to become a master of building

13
00:00:44,592 --> 00:00:47,720
scalable applications. Let's get started, shall we?
