1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:03,870
We're starting with the outlier
data Excel file brought in.

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:10,370
Next, we have the scatterplot tool
setting the h field as the x field, and

3
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:12,460
the income field as the y field.

4
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:18,220
Then we click on plot elements tab,
and deselect the smooth line option.

5
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:23,180
Finally, we'll add a browse tool to the
output of the scatterplot tool, run it,

6
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:26,370
and let's see what the plot
looks like using all the data.

7
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:33,035
Next, to remove outliers for
the people over 60,

8
00:00:33,035 --> 00:00:38,307
we're going to add a filter tool and
select age less than 60.

9
00:00:38,307 --> 00:00:41,945
The true side of the output will filter
out the records where the age is less

10
00:00:41,945 --> 00:00:42,539
than 60.

11
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:46,140
There are 11 records
that meet that criteria.

12
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:52,030
So now let's add a scatter plot tool to
the filtered data stream, and configure

13
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:56,155
it like we did before, and then add
a browse tool to see the results.

14
00:00:56,155 --> 00:00:58,695
Let's review the first
scatterplot again,

15
00:00:58,695 --> 00:01:01,705
there are three outliers
in the scatterplot.

16
00:01:01,705 --> 00:01:06,375
The slope is actually steeper
without the outliers, therefore,

17
00:01:06,375 --> 00:01:09,745
the outliers skewed the model
in a downward direction.
