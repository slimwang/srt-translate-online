1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:04,810
We have concluded that any forward edge
from A to B must be saturated, and

2
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:09,390
any backward edge from
B to A must be unused.

3
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:13,270
Before going any further,
let's illustrate this with an example.

4
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:15,190
Here we have a flow on the left and

5
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:17,820
the corresponding residual
graph on the right.

6
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:22,050
Note that there is no path from
s to t in the residual graph.

7
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:25,310
Let's mark the vertices we
can reach from s in green and

8
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:26,280
the other ones in orange.

9
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:31,590
Now it's easy to see that all the edges
from the green to the orange vertices

10
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:37,130
are saturated, and the edges from
the orange to the green are empty,

11
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:39,210
just like the theorem claims.

12
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:43,656
Recall that for any cut, the value of
a flow is the flow out of the partition

13
00:00:43,656 --> 00:00:47,700
with the source minus the flow into
the partition with the source.

14
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:49,440
As we just argued,

15
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,860
however, in this case there is no
flow back into the source partition.

16
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:56,940
Moreover, the flow
saturates all the edges.

17
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:02,340
So it's just the sum of the capacities
across the cut from A to B,

18
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:05,560
which is then defined
as the cut capacity.

19
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:08,230
That completes the second
part of the theorem.

20
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:11,990
Lastly, we need to show that
the existence of a cut that has the same

21
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:16,450
value as a flow implies that
that flow is a maximum flow.

22
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:21,050
This follows immediately from the fact
that a cut is an upper bound.

23
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:24,310
If it's not an upper bound, then cut
capacity wouldn't be an upper bound

24
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:28,340
on the value of the flow, so
this would produce a contradiction.

25
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:30,240
That then completes the theorem.

26
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,340
These three things are equivalent,
maximum flow is equal to minimum

27
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:38,510
capacity cut, and the Ford-Fulkerson
approach returns a maximum flow.

28
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,108
If you followed all that,
congratulations.

29
00:01:42,108 --> 00:01:44,840
The Max-Flow Min-cut Theorem
is one of the classic

30
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,700
theorems in the study of algorithms, and

31
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:50,970
a wonderful illustration of duality,
which we'll discuss in a later lesson.

32
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:53,800
For now, however, we're not quite
ready to leave maximum flow yet.
