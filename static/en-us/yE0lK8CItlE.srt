00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:05,290
Today we'll talk about planning. Recall that we had said an intelligent agent

2
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:10,750
maps perceptual histories into actions. Planning is a powerful method for

3
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:16,040
action selection. We'll use the syntax we learned from logic

4
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:21,230
last week to set up the specification of goals and states, and operators, for

5
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:25,630
moving between states and achieving goals. We'll see that when

6
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:30,640
there are multiple goals, there can be conflicts between them. We'll describe

7
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,670
a specific technique called partial-order planning that avoids conflict between

8
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:38,440
multiple goals. Finally, we'll talk about a representation called

9
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:42,570
hierarchical task networks that allows us to make complex hierarchical plans.
