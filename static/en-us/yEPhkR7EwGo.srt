1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:04,059
Now that we've found the distribution that results in our observed data, what

2
00:00:04,059 --> 00:00:07,920
confidence can we have that the data parameter we captured is the true value.

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:12,500
The answer is it turns out it depends on how much data we have.

4
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:15,210
To understand why this is, let's consider the following.

5
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:16,870
Imagine that the graph on the left and

6
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:21,480
the right are going to show the PDF for a random variable x.

7
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,150
Let's suppose the one on the left looks like this, and

8
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:25,880
the one on the right looks like this.

9
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:30,110
We can ask the question what's the probability that the random variable x will

10
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:31,980
be greater than a value t.

11
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:35,080
For the graph on the right, more of the probability mass is over on

12
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:38,940
the right side, so it's not surprising that the probability that x is

13
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:43,320
greater than t is larger for the graph on the right, than the one on the left.

14
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:47,870
There is an inequality called Markov's Inequality, which quantifies this notion.

15
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:52,540
Specifically, Markov's Inequality says that, for any random variable, x,

16
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:55,760
the probability that it is greater than t is less than or

17
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,760
equal to, its expectation divided by the number t.

18
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:03,070
Now, for the derivation of this, please see a link in the instructor's notes.

19
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:07,450
Now, this becomes really interesting when you substitute x with x minus mu.

20
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:09,730
Meaning the mean value of x.

21
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:12,630
That is you can think of this quantity here on the right.

22
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:15,040
As x's deviation from its mean value.

23
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,140
When you take this and substitute it into Markov's equality.

24
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:21,450
It then becomes something called Chebyshev's inequality.

25
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:23,500
Chebyshev's inequality says that,

26
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:27,930
the probability that x deviates from it's mean value by an amount,

27
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:33,100
t, is bounded by an expression described by it's variants and t.

28
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:34,890
This is actually really amazing, and

29
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:39,090
quantifies exactly the concepts that we have intuitively talking about.

30
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:43,010
It says the probability that x deviates from its mean is directly related to

31
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:46,530
its variance and its true for any random variable at all.

32
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:49,970
Now here's where we get back into thinking about our beta parameter from our

33
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:51,200
exponential fit.

34
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,310
Recall that if you have a bunch of data points x1 through xn,

35
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:58,220
and you suspect that they might be fit by an exponential distribution.

36
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:01,000
The maximum likelihood estimation method says,

37
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,750
the way we get the beta parameter for that exponential distribution is to

38
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:07,420
take the average of the values you have collected.

39
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:11,640
Now, x bar itself is a random variable, and so we can reason about how

40
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:16,540
much does the X bar that we've calculated deviate from the true beta value.

41
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:20,180
And let's note the actual beta value with a beta star.

42
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:24,620
Now to calculate this we can just directly use Chebyshev's inequality.

43
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:29,660
Now all we're doing is we're substituting x bar minus beta star with x.

44
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:31,380
If we do that, we have this expression,

45
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:36,090
the probability of x bar minus beta star is greater than epsilon is less than or

46
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:40,140
equal to the variance of x bar divided by epsilon squared.

47
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:44,690
And that number turns out to be less than 1 divided by 4n epsilon squared.
