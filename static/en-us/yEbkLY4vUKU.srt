1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
To get the entry for China, we need to select

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
the first element of countries that's indexed at position 0.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
To get the population, well, that's the third element of that list,

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
so that's the entry at position 2.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
To compute the multiple, we need to divide that by the same value

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
for the entry for Romania, and when we run this,

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
we see that the population of China is approximately 64 times

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
the population of Romania, and I should point out

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
that this is integer division, so this is not the exact result.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
If we looked at actually multiplying 21 by 64,

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
the result that we get is 1344, so 1 billion 344 million.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
But the population that we get for China was 1 billion 350 million.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
If we wanted a more exact answer, we need to use floating point division.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
We could do that by changing the values in our list

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
to make one a floating point number.

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Adding a decimal point would be enough.

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Now when we run it, we get a more precise answer.

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Of course, these populations are just estimates,

19
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
so the answer of 64 would probably be a better answer to the actual question.
