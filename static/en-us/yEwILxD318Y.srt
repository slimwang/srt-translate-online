00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:04,170
In this class we discuss different ways
of showing information to the user.

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:06,689
But you might be confused as to
which is the most appropriate for

3
00:00:06,689 --> 00:00:07,620
different situations.

4
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:11,290
See here's a quick run down of when
to use each one of the following.

5
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:16,360
Notifications, regular activity,
always-on activity or watch face.

6
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:19,260
Let's discuss why you'd
use one over the other.

7
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:22,580
Notifications are best when you need
to get the user's attention right now.

8
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:25,200
You have a picnic coming
up in ten minutes so

9
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,410
you need to do something
about this straight away.

10
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:30,300
The information will probably
be out of date after an hour.

11
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,080
Notifications will cause
the wearable to vibrate ensuring

12
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:36,520
the user then glances at the device
to see what they need to know.

13
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:39,080
Regular activities are great when
you need to take care of some

14
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,270
action right now.

15
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:42,430
Such as sending a text
message to a friend.

16
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:46,330
You want the activity to take over the
whole display, show what you just spoke,

17
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:48,380
send the message, and then disappear.

18
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:51,280
You might also want to get more detail
about the weather for the week.

19
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,980
You can scroll through a list to see
what the temperatures are for each day.

20
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:58,120
But this is not something you want to
always be visible when the user is busy

21
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:59,340
doing other things.

22
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:02,550
These regular activities will disappear
when the watch goes into ambient mode

23
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:05,435
and the default watch
face will then be shown.

24
00:01:05,435 --> 00:01:08,260
Always-on activities are special
because when the watch goes into

25
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:11,810
ambient mode after a timeout,
the app continues to run but

26
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:14,340
the display goes into a low power mode.

27
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:17,030
The app draws itself
with much lower detail so

28
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:20,240
it looks good with a reduced
number of pixels illuminated.

29
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,170
This would be great for
a navigation app.

30
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:25,580
When the user is not looking at
the display, the user saves power, but

31
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:28,450
the interface is ready to
be resumed to this one here

32
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:30,060
whenever the user wakes it up.

33
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,700
The user can dismiss the always-on
app when they have finished the task

34
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:33,750
they're performing.

35
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:36,810
But then they can control how
long this task happens for.

36
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:38,460
And finally, there are watch faces.

37
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:42,220
These are selected by the user
as the default watch face, and

38
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:45,170
the wearable shows this whenever
there is nothing else to show.

39
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:48,470
The user is going to be glancing at this
all day to find out what time it is, and

40
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:50,910
what important things there are that
are going on in their lives.
