00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,400
Now, of course, we have to keep in mind that

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:04,930
not all mobile browsers are going to support these new

3
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:08,189
input types, at least, not right away. So the question

4
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:10,360
is, what do you think should happen if a browser

5
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:13,420
doesn't know how to deal with these? Should unknown types

6
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:17,470
fail to display? Should the browser automatically send a detailed

7
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:20,690
bug report to its vendor? Should unknown types fall back

8
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:24,390
to input type equals text? Or do they just crash?
