1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
And just for kicks, let's try this again with a different equation--

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,000
a and b are now -1 for b and 4 for a that describes a different line.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I'm going to give a couple of choices. Here's one, here's another one, and here's the third.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Which one is best reflective of this equation over here?
