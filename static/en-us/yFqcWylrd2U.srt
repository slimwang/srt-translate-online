To learn more about running tasks in
the background, notifications, and

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:06,570
scheduling jobs,
you'll be working on a hydration app.

3
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:09,259
Fun fact,
about sixty percent of you is water.

4
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:12,714
In fact, your brain, which thus far has
hopefully been pretty important for

5
00:00:12,714 --> 00:00:16,027
getting you through this course,
is about seventy three percent water.

6
00:00:16,027 --> 00:00:19,083
The Hydration Reminder app makes sure
you're getting enough water, and

7
00:00:19,082 --> 00:00:21,553
avoiding the common health
consequences of dehydration.

8
00:00:21,553 --> 00:00:23,192
Like headache, dizziness, or

9
00:00:23,192 --> 00:00:26,353
not being able to shed a tear
when your tests aren't passing.

10
00:00:26,353 --> 00:00:30,143
It works by sending you a reminder
notification to drink water every 15

11
00:00:30,143 --> 00:00:32,143
minutes when your phone is charging.

12
00:00:32,143 --> 00:00:32,807
Why?

13
00:00:32,807 --> 00:00:36,551
Because when your phone is charging,
you're more likely to be stationary, and

14
00:00:36,551 --> 00:00:37,054
by water.

15
00:00:37,054 --> 00:00:39,088
Speaking of which.

Okay, so to start us off
let's learn about services.
