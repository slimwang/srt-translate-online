00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:03,500
Let's look at the solution to our
global and local miss rate quiz.

2
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:09,620
For our Level 1 cash, when we say that
it has a 90% hit rate, we don't have

3
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:13,940
to specify whether it's a global or
local hit rate because it's the same.

4
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:19,010
Its local miss rate is
the number of misses divided by

5
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:20,890
the number of accesses to this cache.

6
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,950
Its global miss rate is the number of
misses divided by all the accesses that

7
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:31,750
the processor makes, but because all
these accesses go to this cache,

8
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:35,780
they are the same and they are both 10%.

9
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:40,760
because that's what percentage
of all processor accesses

10
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:42,380
misses in this cache, and

11
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:47,320
that is also the percentage of things
that reach this cache, that miss in it.

12
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,470
For the Level 2 cache,
things are different.

13
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:53,680
It hits for 50% of L1 misses.

14
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:57,119
That means that it misses for
half of the L1 misses.

15
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:02,590
So its local miss rate is 50%.

16
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:05,030
Of all the things that reach this cache,
and

17
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:10,550
those are only L1 misses,
half of them hit and half of them miss.

18
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:14,550
But its global miss rate is only 5%,

19
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:20,302
because only 10% of
the accesses get to this cache,

20
00:01:20,302 --> 00:01:22,940
and half of that misses.

21
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:27,880
So when we express the misses in terms
of all the accesses that the processor

22
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:33,410
made, only 5% of all processor accesses
end up missing in the L2 Cache.
