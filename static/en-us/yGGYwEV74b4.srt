1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,922
All we need to do for each of these, is to figure out what the cost of the

2
00:00:02,922 --> 00:00:07,642
order is. Then what the corresponding cost of postage will be. And add those

3
00:00:07,642 --> 00:00:12,462
two quantities together to get the total cost. If a nozzle set costs $9.99, and

4
00:00:12,462 --> 00:00:18,404
that's all were buying, that's under $10. So postage is just $2.75. $9.99 plus

5
00:00:18,404 --> 00:00:23,860
$2.75 equals $12.74. For B, if we do the same thing, our postage is going to be

6
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:29,220
$5 instead, and we end up with $54.99. For C and D, we need to add together two

7
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:33,630
quantities to find the cost of the order, and our total cost for these two end

8
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:37,409
up being $17.98 and $51.98.
