Great work if you got 6 divided by 55. When we multiply fractions, we multiply

2
00:00:05,342 --> 00:00:09,060
the numerators straight across and the denominators straight across. And if you

3
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:12,840
recall all the way back to our first unit, we want to factor the numerators and

4
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:18,101
denominators first to simplify our math. We know 4 divided by 4 equals 1, and 3

5
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:22,680
divided by 3 also equals 1. Keep in mind I can only simplify one of these 3's,

6
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:26,820
since one is the numerator and one is the denominator. This other 3 must stay in

7
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:30,978
the numerator since there isn't another 3 in the denominator to cancel it out or

8
00:00:30,978 --> 00:00:37,484
simplify to 1. We're left with 2 times 3, which is 6, and 11 times 5 which is

9
00:00:37,484 --> 00:00:37,840
55.
