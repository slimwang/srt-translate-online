00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:05,103
The answer is luckyNumber is 13, and luckyNumber2 is 12. Let's draw the diagram

2
00:00:05,103 --> 00:00:08,945
again. luckyNumber is an int, so instead of having a reference, it just

3
00:00:08,945 --> 00:00:14,440
contains the number itself. So initially, we set it to 13. Then we made

4
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:18,438
luckyNumber2 by copying the value of luckyNumber1. Which isn't a reference this

5
00:00:18,438 --> 00:00:23,726
time. It's just 13. So, luckyNumber2 became 13, then we change the value of

6
00:00:23,726 --> 00:00:29,630
luckyNumber2. We set it equal to 12 instead of 13. Since this isn't a

7
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:34,892
reference, we just reset it to 12, and that's how we get our answer. Again,

8
00:00:34,892 --> 00:00:42,004
ints aren't objects. Strings are objects. Rectangles are objects. Ints are not

9
00:00:42,004 --> 00:00:42,860
objects.
