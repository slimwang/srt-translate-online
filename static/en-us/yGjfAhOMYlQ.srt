1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,992
Option a goes in the first blank and option b goes in the second blank. That

2
00:00:04,992 --> 00:00:09,984
means that this sentence reads, this function takes the length of one cut, in

3
00:00:09,984 --> 00:00:15,006
other words x here, as input, and gives the volume of the box as the output. We

4
00:00:15,006 --> 00:00:19,620
can actually see that from the way that our equation is written. We have x here,

5
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:23,795
as the input, inside the parenthesis, next to the function name. And, the name

6
00:00:23,795 --> 00:00:28,840
of the function is V. And the function itself represents the volume of the box.

7
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:30,265
So, that is the output.
