00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,865
Now that you've seen one, let's see if you have the hang of it. Try finding the

2
00:00:03,865 --> 00:00:07,440
solution set for this inequality and write the solution in interval notation

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:12,900
here. As a hint, this solution will be a union, just like the last problem.

4
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:15,930
We'll have two different regions.
