1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,080
If you completed all those exercises
then you're well on your way to

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:07,490
understanding how Turing machines
compute and hopefully also are ready to

3
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:11,290
be convinced that they can compute as
well as any other possible machine.

4
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:15,986
Before we move onto that argument
however there's some terminology

5
00:00:15,986 --> 00:00:18,893
about Turing machines and
the languages that they accept and

6
00:00:18,893 --> 00:00:22,200
reject and those that they might
loop on that we should set straight.

7
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:27,250
Some of the terms may seem similar, but
the distinctions are important ones, and

8
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:29,650
we'll use them freely throughout
the rest of the course so

9
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:31,010
pay close attention.

10
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:34,670
>> First, we define what it means for
a machine to decide a language.

11
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:39,290
We say a Turing machine decides
a language L if it accepts every string

12
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:43,420
in the language and it rejects
every string not in the language.

13
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:47,950
For example, the Turing machine we
just described decided the language L

14
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:53,449
consisting of strings of the form
w#w where w was a binary string.

15
00:00:53,449 --> 00:00:56,579
We also might say that the Turing
machine computed the function

16
00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:01,289
that is 1 is X is in the language and
0 otherwise.

17
00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:04,578
Or even just that the Turing machine
computed the language at all.
