1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,540
Here's an example of tracking
the predict update cycle.

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:07,961
And this is in a world in which
the actions are guaranteed to work

3
00:00:07,961 --> 00:00:09,138
as advertised.

4
00:00:09,138 --> 00:00:12,689
That is, if you suck,
you clean up the current location, and

5
00:00:12,689 --> 00:00:16,602
if you move right or left, the wheels
actually turn and you do move.

6
00:00:16,602 --> 00:00:21,063
But, we can call this the kindergarten
world because there are little

7
00:00:21,062 --> 00:00:25,759
toddlers walking around who can deposit
dirt in any location at any time.

8
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:31,300
So, if we start off in this state,
and execute the suck action,

9
00:00:32,298 --> 00:00:36,719
we can predict that we'll up
in one of these two states.

10
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,810
Then if we have an observation,

11
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:40,719
well we know what that
observation's going to be.

12
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:44,171
Because we known the suck action always
works, and we know we were in A.

13
00:00:44,171 --> 00:00:48,928
So the only observation we can get is
that we're in A and that it's clean,

14
00:00:48,929 --> 00:00:51,250
we end up in that same belief state.

15
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:57,840
And then if we execute the right action,
well then lots of things could happen.

16
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,630
Because we move right and somebody
might have dropped dirt in the right

17
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:06,769
location and somebody might have dropped
dirt in the left location or maybe not.

18
00:01:06,769 --> 00:01:09,599
And so
we end up with four possibilities, and

19
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:14,500
then we can update again when
we get the next observation.

20
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,822
Say if we observed that plan B and

21
00:01:16,822 --> 00:01:20,262
it's dirty then we end
up in this belief state.

22
00:01:20,262 --> 00:01:22,131
And we can keep on going,

23
00:01:22,131 --> 00:01:27,930
specifying new belief states as result
of successive predicts and updates.

24
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,670
Now, this predict update cycle gives
us a kind of calculus of belief states.

25
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:36,500
That can tell us really
everything we need to know.

26
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:41,349
But there is one weakness with this
approach, is that as you can see here,

27
00:01:41,349 --> 00:01:43,780
some of the belief states
start to get large.

28
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:45,650
And this is a tiny little world,

29
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:49,124
already we have a belief state
with four world states in it.

30
00:01:49,123 --> 00:01:54,354
We could have one with 8,16,1024,
whatever.

31
00:01:54,355 --> 00:01:59,118
And it seems that there maybe more
fixing representations of a belief state

32
00:01:59,117 --> 00:02:02,269
rather than to just list
all the role states.

33
00:02:02,269 --> 00:02:03,659
For example, take this one here.

34
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:09,669
If we have divided the world up not
into individual world states but

35
00:02:09,669 --> 00:02:13,180
into variables describing that state.

36
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:17,030
Then this whole belief state
could be represented just by

37
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:18,000
vacuum is on the right.

38
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:25,629
So the whole world could be represented
by three states or three variables.

39
00:02:25,629 --> 00:02:27,900
One, where is the vacuum?

40
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,550
Is it on the right or not?

41
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:32,300
Secondly, is there dirt
in the left location?

42
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:34,250
And third,
is there dirt in the right location?

43
00:02:35,409 --> 00:02:39,180
And we can add some formula over
those variables to describe states.

44
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:45,780
And with that type of formulation
some very large states, in terms

45
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:50,189
of enumerating the world states, can be
made small in terms of the description.
