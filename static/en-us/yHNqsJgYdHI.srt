00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,524
So far, we've discussed the importance of sleep and the purpose of sleep. But

2
00:00:04,524 --> 00:00:08,431
we still need to address a few of the questions we asked earlier in the lesson.

3
00:00:08,431 --> 00:00:11,599
Namely, is the brain active during sleep and can we become consciously aware of

4
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:15,794
the fact that we are dreaming. There was a time when people thought that the

5
00:00:15,794 --> 00:00:19,865
brain wasn't active or had very little activity while we sleep. However, we now

6
00:00:19,865 --> 00:00:24,038
know that the brain is actually quite active. In fact, given the advancement in

7
00:00:24,038 --> 00:00:27,353
technology, namely through EEG machines, we know that the brain goes through

8
00:00:27,353 --> 00:00:29,670
what we call sleep stages.
