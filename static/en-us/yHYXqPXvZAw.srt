1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:04,290
All right, detect the state where the
user has entered an invalid location.

2
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:09,050
First, add a utility function to reset
the current location status to UNKNOWN.

3
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:12,270
Then call the reset functions in
settings when we change the location.

4
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:17,630
Add an INVALID location status,
then detect the 404 error in

5
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:21,090
getweatherDataFromJson and
set the INVALID status.

6
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:24,560
Create a new string to display
in the empty list view.

7
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:28,110
And add the INVALID location status
to the updateEmptyView function in

8
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:29,850
ForecastFragment.

9
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:33,060
Lots of steps, but everything here
should be pretty straightforward.

10
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:35,620
Take a look at the instructor
notes if you have any questions.
