00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:04,237
The slope of line P is one half, and

2
00:00:04,237 --> 00:00:09,726
the slope of line Q is negative 2. Now, I'd like you to take a second right now,

3
00:00:09,726 --> 00:00:13,626
and reflect on what the special relationship between the slopes of perpendicular

4
00:00:13,626 --> 00:00:17,600
lines might be. Now, you don't actually have to know the answer for

5
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:22,160
sure right now. But just start mulling it over. We'll talk about it very soon.
