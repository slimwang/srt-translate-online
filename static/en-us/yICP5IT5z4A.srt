>> You're right, David. Of the various blocks given here, this block

2
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:17,990
best resembles the black block. And therefore the best guess would be,

3
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:21,140
this is in fact, a black block. This is an example of learning by

4
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:25,630
recording cases, because six cases were recorded in the agent's memory. So

5
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:29,885
when now when a new problem comes along, then the agent gives an answer to

6
00:00:29,885 --> 00:00:34,200
that new problem based on the cases that it already had recorded in its memory,

7
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,670
it simply sees which case most closely resembles the new situation. And

8
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:42,040
gives the answer to the new situation for that most closely resembling case.
