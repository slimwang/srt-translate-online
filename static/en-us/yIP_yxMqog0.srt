1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:03,064
Let's take a moment to talk about scope.

2
00:00:03,064 --> 00:00:06,949
Apart from regular syntax errors, scope
will be at the heart of many coding bugs

3
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:10,144
you run into in pretty much
any programming language.

4
00:00:10,144 --> 00:00:12,049
When programmers talk about scope,

5
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:16,219
they're talking about the part of the
program where a particular identifier,

6
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:21,070
such as a variable or a function name,
is visible or accessible.

7
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:25,469
Trying to figure out if something
is in scope can be tricky at first.

8
00:00:25,469 --> 00:00:26,739
So let's start with an analogy.

9
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:28,900
>> Hey.

10
00:00:28,899 --> 00:00:29,479
>> Hey.

11
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:32,359
>> Do you know where I can find
the book Great Expectations?

12
00:00:32,359 --> 00:00:35,329
>> Yeah, that's in the classic
literature section, come follow me.

13
00:00:35,329 --> 00:00:35,729
>> Perfect.

14
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:41,890
>> In the example you just saw,
James was able to get information about

15
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:45,890
the book he wanted because he asked for
the book while he was in the library.

16
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:49,899
You could say that the information
about where the book was is in scope.

17
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:54,730
>> Hey, I'm looking for
this book, Great Expectations.

18
00:00:54,729 --> 00:00:57,119
Do you know where I could find it?

19
00:00:57,119 --> 00:00:58,481
>> Yeah,
I mean the library is right here.

20
00:00:58,481 --> 00:01:00,469
[MUSIC]

21
00:01:00,469 --> 00:01:01,789
I don't know why you're asking me.

22
00:01:02,859 --> 00:01:05,426
>> Right, yeah, makes a lot of sense.

23
00:01:05,427 --> 00:01:08,066
[MUSIC]

24
00:01:08,066 --> 00:01:09,361
>> In the second example,

25
00:01:09,361 --> 00:01:12,989
when James was outside the library,
the information he wanted and

26
00:01:12,989 --> 00:01:17,939
where he was requesting the information
from, was no longer in the same scope.

27
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:19,659
So he couldn't find the book, and

28
00:01:19,659 --> 00:01:22,579
he couldn't really ask anyone to give
him information about how to find it.
