1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:03,610
As we've used break points, there are a
few icons that you may have noticed here

2
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:05,780
in the variables view that
I haven't explained yet.

3
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:09,350
I'm talking about these icons here,
the A, the L, and

4
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:13,285
there's other ones that we're not seeing
right now for this particular case.

5
00:00:13,285 --> 00:00:15,985
These icons here are actually
pretty straight forward.

6
00:00:15,985 --> 00:00:19,720
And while I could simply tell you what
they are, there's a much better way for

7
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,286
you to learn this information.

8
00:00:21,286 --> 00:00:24,713
I'm here at Apple's WWDC
2012 Session Videos.

9
00:00:24,713 --> 00:00:31,035
And if we scroll down, I want to look
at the Debugging in Xcode video.

10
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:34,890
In this particular session,
Apple's own engineers describe

11
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:39,510
each of the icons that we
see back in Xcode here.

12
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:41,340
While the session itself
is a little dated,

13
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:44,030
the content is still extremely relevant.

14
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:46,730
This particular session contains
a lot of valuable information about

15
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:47,380
Breakpoints.

16
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:49,830
It also contains information
about Breakpoint actions,

17
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:53,900
which we'll cover later in the course,
and other debugging features in Xcode.

18
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:56,210
You can watch the entire
session in the browser.

19
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:57,490
I know it works in Safari.

20
00:00:57,490 --> 00:00:59,780
It may not work in some
of the other browsers.

21
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:01,670
Or you can download
the session itself and

22
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:05,420
skip ahead to the particular segment
that'll help you with this quiz.

23
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:09,450
And I've posted a link to this
page in the instructor notes.

24
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:12,870
And like I said, it's not required that
you watch the entire session to complete

25
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:16,350
the quiz, but I would really encourage
you watch this entire video and

26
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:20,860
really any of Apple's WWDC sessions
because they're such a great source for

27
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:21,960
iOS developers.

28
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:25,030
And the best part about it is
that Apple makes all of their

29
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:29,620
previously recorded WWDC sessions
available online for free and I posted

30
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:33,130
a link to where you can access all
those as well in the instructor notes.

31
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,420
So with that in mind.

32
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:36,630
Watch the video and

33
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:40,830
then matched the following icons
to their correct variable kind.

34
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:41,760
And by variable kind,

35
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:46,040
that's the term that Apple uses to
describe what these labels are.

36
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,680
They relate to a variable kind.

37
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:51,936
Your choices
are instance/global variable.

38
00:01:51,936 --> 00:01:53,864
Local variable.

39
00:01:53,864 --> 00:01:55,940
Static variable.

40
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:56,930
Argument.

41
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:58,100
Expression.

42
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:58,760
And register.

43
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:03,540
Next to each of the icons, write
the number corresponding to your choice.
