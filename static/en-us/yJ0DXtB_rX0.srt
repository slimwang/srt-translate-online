1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:01,340
I'm here with Stuart Frye,

2
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:03,730
who's the Vice President
of Content here at Udacity.

3
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:05,140
Stuart, thank you so much for
talking to us today.

4
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:05,878
>> Absolutely.

5
00:00:05,878 --> 00:00:06,450
>> So Stuart's going to

6
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:08,980
talk to us a bit about the business
side of educational technology.

7
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:11,740
I know many people are interested in
seeing if they can develop something

8
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:13,475
they could spin off into a startup.

9
00:00:13,475 --> 00:00:17,080
Also Stuart, for any of our students who
are interested in going into the startup

10
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:19,630
world or into the ed tech world,
on the business side of things,

11
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:21,990
what should they know about what
it's like to work in this space?

12
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:25,630
>> I think it's,
one of the most interesting and

13
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:30,860
exciting places to start a new business
or launch an innovation right now, but

14
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:34,330
it's also a very complex place
to think about, as a market.

15
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:39,920
Education's one of the places where you
have multiple users and your end user is

16
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,462
not always the person who is making the
purchase decisions about the product.

17
00:00:44,462 --> 00:00:49,115
So if we think about the spectrum
of education from preschool up to

18
00:00:49,115 --> 00:00:49,967
higher ed.

19
00:00:49,967 --> 00:00:56,662
You have parents, you have teachers, you
have students, you have administrators,

20
00:00:56,662 --> 00:01:02,075
and the different products that
are being launched across K-12 and

21
00:01:02,075 --> 00:01:06,589
higher ed are targeted in some
way at a mix of those people.

22
00:01:06,589 --> 00:01:10,066
And identifying who are your end users,
who are your gatekeepers,

23
00:01:10,066 --> 00:01:14,153
and who are making the ultimate purchase
decisions can be one of the most complex

24
00:01:14,153 --> 00:01:18,057
set of decisions you make about your
business model, as well as the features

25
00:01:18,057 --> 00:01:21,730
and functionality you're going to
design the product around.

26
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:22,570
>> Yeah, and I agree completely.

27
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:25,479
I think that, especially as an educator
myself, I'll always think about

28
00:01:25,479 --> 00:01:28,490
the student as my consumer, but that's
not the person you end up selling to.

29
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:29,330
That's the person that

30
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:31,044
ends up using your tool- [CROSSTALK]
>> Right.

31
00:01:31,044 --> 00:01:34,664
>> And oftentimes what they would think
about your tool is not the ultimate

32
00:01:34,664 --> 00:01:36,666
issue, learning can be frustrating.

33
00:01:36,666 --> 00:01:38,414
>> Yep.
>> It's the only domain I know of where

34
00:01:38,414 --> 00:01:41,290
frustrating your end user can sometimes
actually be part of the goal.

35
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:42,580
>> Yep, absolutely.

36
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:44,780
>> So I know that some of our
students have project ideas already,

37
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:46,825
some of them are probably looking for
ideas.

38
00:01:46,825 --> 00:01:48,330
They know,
they want to go into this space, but

39
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:49,890
they don't know exactly what to do.

40
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:51,340
So are there any open issues,

41
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:53,600
open problems that you think
would be worth tackling?

42
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:59,180
>> Yeah, I mean, I think as you
think about problems to solve

43
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:01,490
in the education space,

44
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:04,060
I think your solutions are going to
fall into a couple of categories.

45
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:08,400
One is a content category, so,
that's where Udacity plays, right?

46
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:13,200
We are creating content that
we're making available as part of

47
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,109
an online Master's degree program or
as part of our nano degree programs.

48
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,080
In addition to content, there are tools.

49
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:24,720
So tools either for students,
maybe it makes students more productive,

50
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:29,680
a better way to take notes,
develop projects, tools for

51
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:35,470
teachers, a better way to discover new
content, track data, analyze students.

52
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:37,650
And I think between content and

53
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:42,220
tools, you need to think about which
area your solution lies best in.

54
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:45,940
Also, always encourage
entrepreneurs to think about

55
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:47,850
a problem you've faced immediately.

56
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:51,850
So, if you haven't spent any time
in a classroom as an educator,

57
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:56,540
you might think about tackling
a problem that students face,

58
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:58,430
because you have spent
time as a student.

59
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:01,030
On the other hand David, you've spent
a ton of time as an educator and

60
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:04,020
you probably have a long list of
problems that you'd like solved.

61
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:07,630
So I would start there when you think
about coming up with a solution or

62
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:08,580
a business idea.

63
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:11,250
>> Yeah, makes sense, I think in
some ways when you're designing for

64
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:12,120
yourself as a customer.

65
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:12,870
It's a good place to start,

66
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:14,870
although you never want to design
your entire project that way,

67
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:17,250
because you don't want to design
something that's great for you, but

68
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:18,550
doesn't work for anybody else.

69
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:22,370
>> Right and I think that emphasizes
the importance of user testing.

70
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:24,490
At the very earliest stages,

71
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:30,310
I mean any ed tech idea that you
have should start as wire frames,

72
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:34,760
pencil sketches, balsamic, mock ups
that you get out in front of people.

73
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:35,660
See how they react.

74
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:39,860
Test an idea very early and
often rather than, to your point,

75
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:42,760
designing an end solution that works
perfectly for you as an individual, but

76
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:45,770
doesn't have product
market fit more broadly.

77
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:46,800
>> Yeah, absolutely.

78
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,738
So let's say it's the end of
the semester, a day after the final

79
00:03:49,738 --> 00:03:52,743
project is due and now students
are wondering, what do I do next?

80
00:03:52,743 --> 00:03:55,987
What do you think the first step that
they should take when the semester's

81
00:03:55,987 --> 00:03:59,409
over, to maybe scale their project up
and do a business or startup should be?

82
00:03:59,409 --> 00:04:03,100
>> Oh wow, yeah so,
this gets back to user testing.

83
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:08,430
I would identify 20 people that could
be the end user of your product,

84
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:10,860
and go out and
get some version of it in their hands.

85
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:13,830
And when I say a version of it,
I do mean it could be a wire frame,

86
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:17,079
it could be a mock up,
it could be a prototype in Photoshop, or

87
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:21,220
you could have written some code and
built out a very simple working version.

88
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:25,701
But step one is to get it out in front
of people, because I guarantee you,

89
00:04:25,701 --> 00:04:28,726
your solution will change and
evolve over time.

90
00:04:28,726 --> 00:04:33,260
And the more quickly you can get
input beyond your own, the better.

91
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:36,420
And finding those people to test
with isn't always easy, but

92
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:41,070
I think within the context you have,
I mean you're on a university or

93
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:43,310
you're surrounded by a community
of students, at least.

94
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:47,240
Virtually you can find
a lot of people quickly.

95
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,970
>> Yeah, I think that because
we're in this community and

96
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:51,580
because I think a lot of the projects
that our students develop will

97
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:54,888
actually be targeted at the OS program,
because it's what they experience.

98
00:04:54,888 --> 00:04:57,410
You've got 3,000 people sitting around,
experiencing the same thing that you're

99
00:04:57,410 --> 00:04:59,750
experiencing, who might be
willing to test it out.

100
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:00,520
>> Yep, absolutely.

101
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:03,370
>> I can also share that for
the NSF iCore project,

102
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:07,630
which seeks to turn academic
research into real world businesses,

103
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:10,150
one of the first things they ask
all their participants to do is

104
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:13,990
find 100 customers in one month, and
talk to all of them for half an hour.

105
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:15,777
>> Wow,
do they have to be paying customers?

106
00:05:15,777 --> 00:05:17,436
>> I don't think, no,
not paying customers yet, but

107
00:05:17,436 --> 00:05:18,426
100 potential customers.

108
00:05:18,426 --> 00:05:19,030
>> Okay.

109
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:22,052
>> So for this it would be,
talk to 100 parents, students, teachers,

110
00:05:22,052 --> 00:05:24,639
principals, get the the full
range of perspectives on that.

111
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:25,282
>> Okay.
>> And

112
00:05:25,282 --> 00:05:27,830
they really value that
side of things as well.

113
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:28,357
>> Awesome.

114
00:05:28,357 --> 00:05:32,800
>> Anything last to share with our
student about working in this field?

115
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,490
>> I think we often say that,
there are two big fields that have yet

116
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:40,950
to be disrupted by technology,
education, and healthcare.

117
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:44,100
Two pretty important ones, right?

118
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:49,540
I would say that disruption is a word
that's often overused and misused.

119
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:53,480
But when you boil down some of
the key tenets that Clay Christensen

120
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:56,210
talks about when it comes
to disruptive technologies.

121
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:58,970
One of those tenets that I
personally find most exciting,

122
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:02,780
I think offers the most promise
to powerful solutions in

123
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:05,340
education technology is non consumption.

124
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:08,790
If you think about the fact that,
in the United States,

125
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:11,750
only one in three adults
has a four year degree.

126
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:16,800
And internationally, only about 7% of
people end up with an advanced degree.

127
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,470
The number of people,
that the things you build, could impact.

128
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:24,520
If you go over and after those
people who are least well served by

129
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:29,510
the existing system today, the non
consumer of quality education today,

130
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:33,160
people who can't benefit from
the system as it's built.

131
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:38,340
That's a huge number of people and
it's a massive impact.

132
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:42,200
So look for those non consumers,
look for those opportunities to

133
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:46,258
help people who aren't being helped
today and you'll build great products.

134
00:06:46,258 --> 00:06:48,347
>> That sounds like
part of the foundation,

135
00:06:48,347 --> 00:06:52,107
part of the philosophy behind this
program in general is finding people who

136
00:06:52,107 --> 00:06:55,329
may not be the underserved people
in some remote countries, but

137
00:06:55,329 --> 00:06:58,730
people who currently can't access
quality higher education based

138
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:01,270
on geographic, or family, or-
>> Economic.

139
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:02,420
>> Yeah, exactly, constraints.

140
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:03,060
>> Yep.

141
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:04,250
>> Great.
Thank you so much for

142
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:05,190
talking to us today.

143
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:09,910
>> Absolutely, thanks for having me,
hope anything I said is helpful and

144
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:12,360
I hope you build amazing things,
good luck.

145
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:12,860
>> Thanks.
