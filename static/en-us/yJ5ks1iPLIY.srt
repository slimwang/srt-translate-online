00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:02,980
Classes are easily the most useful and

2
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:05,970
versatile type of
selectors that you can use.

3
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:10,510
For this exercise, I want you to
tell me which HTML would match for

4
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:12,650
the following class selector.

5
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:16,700
On the left, I've written a CSS rule
set that uses a class selector for

6
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:20,550
the class right and changes
the text-align property to right.

7
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:25,650
On the right, I've listed different
HTML elements that do and

8
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:27,460
do not match for the given CSS.

9
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:29,760
Check all that apply.
