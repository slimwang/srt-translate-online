1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Well, x equals three is certainly a statement.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
We've seen examples like this before.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
You might have thought that a statement has to end in a semicolon,

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
but if we scroll back to our grammar a bit,

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
we see, no, a statement can be identifier equals expression,

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
and those semicolons come in when we have multiple statements,

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
like in a compound statement block.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Similarly, x equals 3 divided by 2.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Any expression can go on the right-hand side of the equal sign,

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
and we saw that our grammar for expression earlier included binary operators like division.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
This totally works.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
This series of tokens, if x is less than 5 then open curly brace x equals x plus 1 curly brace

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
looks very convincing.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
It's almost right, but it's missing a semicolon.

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Inside these compound blocks we really need those. This one doesn't work.

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,000
The one right below it has that semicolon, so it can be derived from "stmt" in our grammar.

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Over here inside our compound statement we have two smaller statements--

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
x is x plus 1 and y is 3.

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Each one of which is an individual statement,

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
and each one of which is terminated by a semicolon.

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
That's the rule we established earlier.

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Finally over here we have an if-then-else statement.

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
This was a little tricky.

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
In Python conceptually this might work out, but in JavaScript we explicitly need the else token.

25
00:01:21,000 --> 99:59:59,999
This one is not derivable from stmt, even though the rest of it is well-formed.
