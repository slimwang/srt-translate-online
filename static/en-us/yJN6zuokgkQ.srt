00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:09,910
Now, if you were to take a guess, were would you place open, in our model of

00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:15,440
the Python Standard Library, would it be inside OS, or would it be in a space

4
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,980
all by itself, or would it be outside

5
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:20,790
the Python Standard Library? Where would you place open?
