00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:04,216
Well, we know the rate has to be the distance divided by the time. An easy way

2
00:00:04,216 --> 00:00:09,623
to think about it is just a rate, like miles per hour. We know miles is a

3
00:00:09,623 --> 00:00:14,278
distance, per, which means we'll use division, an hour, which is time. If we

4
00:00:14,278 --> 00:00:18,494
want to solve using algebra, we'll take this equation and we'll divide both

5
00:00:18,494 --> 00:00:23,881
sides By the variable t. This will isolate the r. So we know the rate is

6
00:00:23,881 --> 00:00:28,475
distance divided by time. If we want to solve for time, then instead of

7
00:00:28,475 --> 00:00:33,384
dividing both sides by t, let's divide both sides by r. When we divide this

8
00:00:33,384 --> 00:00:39,926
side by r and this side by r, we'll get d divided by r is equal to 1 t. So we

9
00:00:39,926 --> 00:00:42,915
know the amount of time an object traveled would be its distance traveled

10
00:00:42,915 --> 00:00:44,630
divided by its rate.
