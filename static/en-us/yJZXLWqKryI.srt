1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,020
So, how do you go about solving this?

2
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:06,300
Let's first figure out what the number of blocks should be.

3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:08,570
Since we're only interested in whole blocks,

4
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:10,540
we use the floor function to round off.

5
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:14,665
Okay, now initialize disparity as a row-vector.

6
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:19,840
For each block, let's compute the x coordinate of the left edge.

7
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,954
Note that MATLAB and Octave begin indexing at 1.

8
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:27,070
Use this to extract an image patch from the left strip.

9
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:32,659
Now find its best matching exposition in the right strip.

10
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:36,800
And finally, compute disparity as the difference between expositions in

11
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,220
the left and right images.

12
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:40,750
Okay? Let's run this.

13
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:47,180
Six disparity values, as expected, but they don't make much sense, do they?

14
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:48,100
Let's try to plot them.

15
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:53,470
Okay, so what does the 0 in the first block position mean?

16
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:55,710
Well, it just says that the best match for

17
00:00:55,710 --> 00:01:00,770
the block in the left image was found at the same position in the right image.

18
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:02,240
How about the peak at position 2?

19
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:06,860
This says that the second block has apparently moved a lot.

20
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:08,840
You can actually verify this visually.

21
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:14,190
Look at this feature in the left strip and its position in the right strip.

22
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:20,130
Different blocks have apparently moved by different amounts.

23
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:24,010
Now, how do these disparity values relate to depth in the scene?

24
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:27,090
Think of what are the drawbacks of a simple approach like this.
