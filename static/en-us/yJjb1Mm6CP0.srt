1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,222
Now we're going to focus on Switches for
a minute and

2
00:00:03,222 --> 00:00:07,769
see what we can learn by revisiting
Apple's documentation on UI controls.

3
00:00:07,769 --> 00:00:08,988
When we use buttons,

4
00:00:08,988 --> 00:00:13,063
we configure our target actions to
work with the event touch up inside.

5
00:00:13,063 --> 00:00:15,752
What's the name of the event
that corresponds with the switch

6
00:00:15,752 --> 00:00:16,430
being thrown?

7
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:18,704
How do we know if the switch is on or
off?

8
00:00:18,704 --> 00:00:21,592
Find the class reference document for
UI switch and

9
00:00:21,592 --> 00:00:23,480
then check the correct options.
