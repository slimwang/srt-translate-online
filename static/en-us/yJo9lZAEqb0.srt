Hi I'm Paul Lewis and
I'm a Developer Advocate at Google.

2
00:00:03,192 --> 00:00:04,410
>> And I'm Cameron Pittman.

3
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:07,390
I make front end web development
courses here at Udacity.

4
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:10,880
We're here to help you develop
apps that run at a silky smooth

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,120
60 frames per second.

6
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:14,660
And you may think it's just JavaScript
that you need to worry about but

7
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:16,590
there's actually a lot
more to it than that.

8
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:19,602
This course is about changing the way
that you approach performance issues.

9
00:00:19,602 --> 00:00:22,830
We're going to help you
look at the bigger picture.

10
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:24,760
>> Okay let's play a game.

11
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:27,460
This was made by my
colleague Jake Archibald and

12
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:31,740
it's designed to show off problems with
frame rates and performance on the web.

13
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:32,729
See these ships at the top?

14
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:34,420
They move smoothly.

15
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:36,320
The ones at the bottom judder.

16
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,458
The game is super simple,

17
00:00:37,458 --> 00:00:41,692
shoot the juddering ships as quickly
as you can by clicking on them.

18
00:00:41,692 --> 00:00:44,230
You're going to have to spot
them amongst the smooth ones.

19
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:47,590
>> Okay,
I'm going to shoot the juddering ships.

20
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:49,980
That's a hard, weird British word.

21
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:51,450
>> It's an amazing British word.

22
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:52,170
>> I think you made it up.

23
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:54,990
>> It's just English,
which means I can't be wrong.

24
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:56,298
>> That's not true.

25
00:00:56,298 --> 00:00:58,620
>> That's very true.

26
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:00,040
You are not doing well.

27
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:00,825
>> That's not great.

28
00:01:00,825 --> 00:01:03,660
Well anyway, I hit the wrong one, but
I hope you could do a lot better.
