00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
There was only one correct answer, which is this one over here.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,000
The inadmissibility of the heuristic might lead down an exploration of the state space

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
that leads to the goal on a suboptimal path.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Let me demonstrate this to you.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Here is a world. Suppose our start step is here. Our goal is here.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
The heuristic is super large for those states over here

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
and smaller around here.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
The nodes will be expanded following the zeros around here and around here,

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
and the first time the goal is set occurs when we reach the point over here.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
We never discover the shortcut straight from S to G

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
because of the inadmissible heuristic.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
That renders point 2 correct, and as a result

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
A-star will not always find the optimal path as I have just proven.

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Now, it turns out A-star will find the path if one exists.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
It might find a suboptimal path, but eventually it expands

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
all the nodes that can be reached.

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
If the goal state is among them, it'll succeed to find a path.

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Therefore this answer here was wrong.

19
00:01:01,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Of course, none of the above is also a false answer.
