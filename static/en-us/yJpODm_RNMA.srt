1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The next thing we're going to look at

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
is how big does the hash output need to be

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
to provide the properties we need?

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
So first let's just consider a weak collision resistance.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
So the question is assuming that our attacker has just enough computing power

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
to perform 2 to the 62 hashes, how many bits should our ideal hash function--and

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
we're assuming now that we have an ideal hash function that provides a perfect

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
uniform distribution on the outputs--to provide weak collision resistance?

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
And to formalize what we mean by providing that, let's assume

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
that we're satisfied as long as the attacker's success probability of finding

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
some pre-image that hashes to our value H is less than one-half.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Of course, for most applications we want this probability to be much less than one-half.

13
00:00:47,000 --> 99:59:59,999
To answer, give the number of bits in the output of H.
