1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,489
If we add these two times together we know they should sum to the total amount

2
00:00:03,489 --> 00:00:08,582
of time it takes our boat to travel 12 miles. The boat can make the trip in 1

3
00:00:08,582 --> 00:00:13,943
hour and 4 minutes. But here's our problem, this is in hours and minutes and

4
00:00:13,943 --> 00:00:20,508
these units are in only hours so we can't quite set up an equation just yet. We

5
00:00:20,508 --> 00:00:25,668
need to convert this to only units of hours. So if we want to convert this to

6
00:00:25,668 --> 00:00:28,640
hours, what improper fraction could we write?
