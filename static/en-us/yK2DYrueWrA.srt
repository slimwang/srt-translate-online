00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,110
How about we take a look at a seemingly simple little puzzle.

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:07,500
Let's say we have a list of string pairs.

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:15,450
So a pair b, aabb, and a pair bba, abb, and so on, and we have some number of these pairs.

4
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:21,710
My question is, can we select from these pairs so that the 1st strings form the same strings

5
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:23,710
as the 2nd strings?

6
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:27,330
Let me show you an example to let you know what I mean.

7
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:32,369
Let's pick these pairs in the following order: The 3rd one, the 2nd one, the 4th one,

8
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:36,690
the 2nd one again, the 3rd one again, and finally the 1st one.

9
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:41,960
If we do that, and we can catenate the 1st string in the pair and can catenate the 2nd strings

10
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:45,210
in the pair, then we get this string.

11
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:48,340
If you look at these, then they are equal.

12
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:50,550
Beit they're cut in different places.

13
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:55,320
We take the 3rd one first, and we start with aabb and aa.

14
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:59,880
Then we take the 2nd one, bba here, abb here, and so on.

15
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:04,410
This problem, whether or not we can do this with a given set of strings,

16
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:08,430
is called the post correspondance problem or PCP,

17
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:11,430
after the logician Emil Post who first posed it.

18
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:14,630
Here is the really mindblowing part.

19
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:23,170
It turns out that any computer program can be stated as a PCP using just 7 pairs of strings.

20
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:27,490
Now I'd like you to tell me what this means from the given list of statements.

21
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:31,730
Does it mean that PCP is generally undecidable for 7 pairs of strings or more?

22
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:35,400
Or does it mean PCP is generally decidable for 6 pairs of strings or less?

23
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:40,230
Any SAT problem can be transformed into a PCP using 7 strings.

24
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:46,350
And finally, no PCP instance with 7 pairs of strings or more is decidable.

25
00:01:46,350 --> 99:59:59,999
Check whichever statements you feel are true.
