00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:03,540
Let's talk about URLs. undoubtedly, you've seen

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:07,310
URLs before. URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator.

3
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:13,080
An example of URL would be as follows. This is an example of URL. It's

4
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:18,170
got three main parts. It's got the protocol, separated by a column and two

5
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:25,590
slashes from the host. Which precedes the path and in this case the path is just

6
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:28,020
a slash and if we didn't have that slash there the

7
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:31,010
path would still be a slash because that's the, the minimum path.

8
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:34,230
Now, the protocol can be a number of things but for

9
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:37,780
our purposes it's going to be http almost all the time. We will

10
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:41,260
also see https from time to time. And you'll see other

11
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:45,200
protocols around the web. You might see ftp or you know, things,

12
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,050
things like that, but http basically means, you know, the web.

13
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:51,160
That's, that's what we're going to be learning in this class. The host,

14
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:53,840
this is the host name or domain name of the, of

15
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,860
the server that has the document we want to access. This

16
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:59,680
can also be an IP address. This host just of course,

17
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,180
translates into an IP address, and this is the. You know, the

18
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:06,050
description of the location of the physical machine that has the

19
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:09,640
document we want to fetch. And the path is the document

20
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:12,810
we're going to fetch. Now, the path can be more complicated.

21
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:16,710
So the path would be this whole thing if we were accessing

22
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:19,840
the image we were using in the previous part of the lecture.
