1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,590
Now it's your turn to
write some media queries.

2
00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:05,270
You'll be using dev tools to
make some changes to this page.

3
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:07,750
Inside the elements pane,
open up the head.

4
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:09,650
There, you'll find a style tag,

5
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:14,450
and inside the style tag, you've got
some breakpoints set up for you.

6
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:17,250
And it's here within the style tag,
that I want you to make your changes.

7
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:20,730
Simply right click and do edit as HTML.

8
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:22,490
And you'll be able to change it.

9
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:23,510
Apply style, so

10
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:28,520
that between zero and 400 pixels,
the background color changes to red.

11
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:33,880
And then between 401 and 599 pixels,
the background should be green.

12
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:38,450
And if the page is 600 pixels or
wider, make the background blue.

13
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:42,090
When you've set the right break points,
you'll see a code on the screen.

14
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:44,100
Type it in here to continue.

15
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:48,400
And by the way, you might find it's
easier to actually write your code in

16
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:52,280
a regular code editor like
Sublime Text and then paste it in here
