1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,480
So let's take a look at the code for

2
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:04,290
getting the profile out of the data store. So

3
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:07,730
here's the getProfile method. Throws an exception if the

4
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:11,080
user is not authorized. We get the key, get the

5
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:16,219
user ID to use as the ID for the key. We create the key, and then we get the

6
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:21,380
profile. Now ofy.load returns an object. So, in this

7
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:24,950
case, we want it to be kind profile, class profile.

8
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:27,480
So, we have to cast it as a profile
