1
00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:04,780
Other than HIEs operated by what
are essentially a very large scale

2
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:10,620
health enterprise, such as
the Kaiser HMO or the VA Health System,

3
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:15,490
I couldn't provide another example
of centralized HIE at the scope and

4
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:17,700
sophistication of IHIE.

5
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:21,240
Why has Indiana been able to do it?

6
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:24,850
A big part of the answer is the
Regenstrief Foundation that supported

7
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:30,140
the development of the technology and
the HIE over a period of many years.

8
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:32,280
Without that unusual support,

9
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:35,990
we might not have an IHIE to
be proud of and point to.
