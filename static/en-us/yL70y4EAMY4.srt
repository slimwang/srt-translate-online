1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:01,880
So, here you go.

2
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:08,676
So a very simple JAVA/Python program which kind of serves as a backend.

3
00:00:08,676 --> 00:00:10,940
And is going to consume the tweets and

4
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:14,480
parse the tweets for the URL and just count them.

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:15,460
Right?

6
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:19,170
So then in order to present the nice interface to his boss, so

7
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:23,920
that he can use he can use it, so write a, you'll write a small web app

8
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:29,490
that in turn contacts the program every few seconds and to display the count.

9
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:33,519
So that when Lewis' boss goes to the website,

10
00:00:33,519 --> 00:00:36,013
the realtime dashboard is always refreshing.

11
00:00:36,013 --> 00:00:37,173
Right?

12
00:00:37,173 --> 00:00:40,170
So to give that in perspective,.

13
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:43,500
So you have this job on Python backend, and

14
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:47,410
that is going to keep accessing that to the stream.

15
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:52,824
And the backend also does the same filters and calculates the count.

16
00:00:52,824 --> 00:00:53,480
And there is a web app and

17
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:58,610
there is a real time dashboard that boss is going to use.

18
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:01,630
Whenever the AirTime request comes or when the,

19
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:03,780
whenever the board uses the Real Time dashboard,

20
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:08,230
you go to the web app that in turn gets the data from the Java/Python backend.

21
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:11,560
And you can get the visibility in real time right away.

22
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:15,620
Right? Now, the questions.

23
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:16,850
What are the issues with this solution?
