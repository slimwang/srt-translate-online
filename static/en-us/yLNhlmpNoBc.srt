00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,780
When your learning how to use
a new feature or language,

2
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:06,990
you'll often look at example code to
give you a model of what to write.

3
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:10,180
Then you'll write code that's
based on the example code, but

4
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:12,700
you'll change it to do
what you want it to.

5
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:15,330
But if that doesn't work, what then?

6
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:17,980
What a lot of new programmers
try at this point,

7
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:21,925
is to try making random changes
to their non-working code.

8
00:00:21,925 --> 00:00:24,930
And then when that doesn't work,
they ask for help.

9
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:26,580
Here's another approach.

10
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:29,390
When your code doesn't work,
set it aside,

11
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:33,040
comment it out, like this,
then copy the example code.

12
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,460
Copy and paste, really.

13
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:37,020
Don't try to change it at this point.

14
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:41,020
Just run it ,and make sure that
it does what it's supposed to.

15
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:45,470
Then modify it in small steps, until it
does what you wanted your code to do.

16
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,790
That looks better.

17
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:52,080
And then once your done, see if you can
find where your original code had a bug.

18
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,040
Try that now.

19
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,800
Given what you've seen here, find and

20
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,010
fix the bug in the original
version of boldwrap.
