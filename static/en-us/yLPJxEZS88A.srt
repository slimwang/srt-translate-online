1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:01,540
Okay, Mikey, you got answers for me?

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:03,960
>> sure.

3
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:04,420
>> Alright.

4
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:06,340
>> Wait, should I, do need to make any assumption, or

5
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:10,471
can I make any assumptions I want about the non-blue states?

6
00:00:10,471 --> 00:00:11,986
>> No. It doesn't matter. [LAUGH] Actually. [LAUGH]

7
00:00:11,986 --> 00:00:13,230
>> So the answer is no.

8
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:13,850
>> Maybe it does.

9
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:14,740
>> The answer is no. But it

10
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:17,300
doesn't actually matter because Remember, it's all

11
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:21,220
very stationary and Marcovian. So the only thing that matters is where you are.

12
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:25,270
>> You're stationary Marcovian. Alright, so I think,

13
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:27,080
okay. So let's, let's do the first one, then.

14
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:27,310
>> Okay.

15
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:29,030
>> So, so this is, this is pretty cool.

16
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:31,450
So by changing the reward the way that you

17
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:34,320
did, it is now, it's not a hot beach

18
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,480
anymore. It's like. You know like, super awesome money beach.

19
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,130
>> Yes, it's like a beach made of bacon.

20
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:44,720
>> Sure. Okay. Let's think of it that way.

21
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,260
Although neither of us is eating bacon at the moment.

22
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:46,840
>> At the moment.

23
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:48,530
>> But. [CROSSTALK]

24
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:50,560
>> Great, because, because then our mouths

25
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,560
would be full and it would be very difficult to give

26
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:55,880
this lecture. Alright so, no, no, no,no, no I mean like, even.

27
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:00,570
Alright, never mind. The point is that it's awesome, and there's like

28
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:03,030
diamonds. I don't know, I just saw The Hobbit movie, and there

29
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:06,930
is a room filled entirely with treasures. And so, this is

30
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:09,400
kind of like that. And so now the question is, what should

31
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:12,110
I be doing, like I should never go to the plus 1

32
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:15,690
or the minus 1, because that ends my treasure gathering. I should

33
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:18,760
just continue to stay in states that aren't those states.

34
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:19,390
>> Okay.

35
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:22,190
>> So I would say left for the, for the top state.

36
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:26,000
>> Mm-hm. Let's say left for the bottom state.

37
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:26,840
>> This one?

38
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:27,914
>> The, yes, uh-huh.

39
00:01:27,914 --> 00:01:28,190
>> Okay.

40
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:33,530
>> And the other two, I need to think about for a moment.

41
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:37,050
So I feel like I'd like to get away from the minus 1.

42
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:38,593
>> Mm-hm.

43
00:01:38,593 --> 00:01:40,810
>> So, like, you know, to go up.

44
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:43,130
But then that would give me some chance of slipping, wouldn't it?

45
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:45,690
>> Mm-hm. Lets see, I don't want to go to the right. I don't

46
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:48,270
want to go down. I don't want to go. I'm going to go to the left.

47
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:48,595
>> Mm-hm.

48
00:01:48,595 --> 00:01:51,570
>> I'm going to bash my head against the wall, because then I get money.

49
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:51,920
>> Yeah.

50
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,880
>> That's weird. There's really no pain for running into the wall?

51
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:57,990
>> No. You just stay where you are.

52
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:01,300
>> Alright and for the bottom one, I feel

53
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,620
like it's the same kind of thing. I don't

54
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:04,190
want to go to the right or to the left,

55
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:06,640
cause then there's a probability that I'll slip and

56
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,800
end up ending my game. So I'm going to go down.

57
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:12,550
>> yeah. I like that. So most of these are

58
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:16,330
right, and one of them is wrong. Or, it's not

59
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:18,980
that it's wrong, it's just that's not as right as

60
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:20,760
it could be. Which one do you think that is?

61
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:23,910
>> I think they're right. But if, if

62
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,880
there's one that I could imagine you not being

63
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,730
so happy with, which is the bottom one,

64
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:28,960
There are two bottom ones. You mean this one?

65
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,020
>> Yeah.

66
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:31,190
>> Yeah. What would I like?

67
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:32,760
>> I think

68
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,760
you might prefer if I bash my head against the wall.

69
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:37,490
>> No, actually, it turns out that this is

70
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,650
a correct answer so all four of these are correct.

71
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:42,120
But in this particular state, it actually doesn't matter which

72
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,630
way you go. Oh, I see. A more complete answer.

73
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:45,970
>> Yes.

74
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:47,490
>> Would be, doesn't matter.

75
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:47,640
>> Yeah.

76
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:50,270
>> And is that true of any of the other ones? No. I guess,

77
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:54,370
I guess you're right. The other ones, you have to go in the direction indicated.

78
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:55,660
>> Right. So, by the way, just like

79
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:57,910
here, it doesn't matter which direction you go in.

80
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:59,200
It's actually true for all of the other

81
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,410
states as well. It doesn't matter where you go

82
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:03,620
because In these three states, these are the

83
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:05,750
only states where you can accidentally, you could end

84
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:07,560
the game. And in each of them, you

85
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,230
can take an action that guarantees that you don't

86
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:10,880
end the game. So it really doesn't matter

87
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,310
about where you do it in the other states.

88
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:13,130
>> Cool.

89
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:15,850
>> Right? So that's a good argument. This makes

90
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:17,150
a lot of sense. So at the end of the

91
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:20,320
day, basically, because the reward is positive. And you're just

92
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:23,590
accumulating reward or diamonds and treasure, as you put it.

93
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:26,200
You just never want to leave, so you always want to avoid either

94
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,937
of these states. It doesn't matter that there's a +1 here

95
00:03:28,937 --> 00:03:31,740
and a -1 here. If I can stay here forever, then

96
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:35,870
I just accumulate positive reward forever. Okay, so what's the next one?

97
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:41,410
>> So, interesting. So now, now the beach

98
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:44,330
is really, really hot. It's minus 2, so.

99
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:48,660
>> Mm-hm. I want to get off here as quickly as I can. So definitely the top

100
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:50,940
one, I would go to the right. Just try to

101
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:53,780
get, get that +1 and get out of, get outta here.

102
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:54,410
>> Yeah.

103
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:57,190
>> Alright, so then, let's think about the bottom right.

104
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:58,570
>> Okay.

105
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:01,330
>> So, in the best of all possible worlds

106
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:04,570
I go around and dump into the +1. And that

107
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:07,480
would take me again if, if I don't slip

108
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:10,950
at all one, two, three, four steps to do that

109
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:11,833
>> Mm-hm.

110
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:14,090
>> Actually wait one, two, three, three steps one

111
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:14,800
the hot sand.

112
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,760
>> Yup

113
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,728
>> And I'm getting and -2 for each of those. So that's like minus 6.

114
00:04:19,728 --> 00:04:21,197
>> Mm-hm.

115
00:04:21,197 --> 00:04:23,070
>> So I could get that plus 1 at the end, and that

116
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:27,330
makes it only minus 5. But I think I'd rather just get off the

117
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:30,750
beach. So I'm going to say in the bottom right to actually dive into

118
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:33,810
the pit of pain, because it can't be as bad as where I am.

119
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:35,490
>> That's exactly right.

120
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:37,650
>> So, okay, so then the, the one next

121
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:39,750
to it on the left is a little trickier.

122
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:45,800
If I go up to the plus 1, I get a minus 2 Followed by a +1 which is also -1.

123
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,265
>> Mm-hm.

124
00:04:47,265 --> 00:04:49,770
>> So okay. I'm not so sure about that one.

125
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:51,050
>> Well remember you'll always have some

126
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:54,010
probablitly of ending up back where you started

127
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:56,070
>> Is that true? Oh because, if I. Well no,

128
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:57,535
no, that's not true if I dive straight into the

129
00:04:57,535 --> 00:05:00,355
-1. Then I have 0.8 chance of going to the

130
00:05:00,355 --> 00:05:04,155
-1. 0.2 of going up. To the arrow that's labeled,

131
00:05:04,155 --> 00:05:06,810
0.2 going down to the blue box that's not labeled

132
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:08,143
>> Mm-hm.

133
00:05:08,143 --> 00:05:09,370
>> Wait, 0.2? No, 0.1

134
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:10,620
>> Mm-hm.

135
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:14,038
>> Whereas if I go up, right, I might stay where I am.

136
00:05:14,038 --> 00:05:17,860
And accrue -2, like, yeah I feel like I need a calculator for this.

137
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:20,150
>> Yeah, but you're, I think your intuition

138
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:23,160
is right, though. Just think about it as

139
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,580
How much, I mean what do you think

140
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:28,650
has the best chance of most quickly ending things?

141
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:29,420
>> Well certainly jumping

142
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:30,310
into the -1.

143
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:31,570
>> Right.

144
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:32,640
>> I think that's going to be marginally

145
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,880
better because there's only one chance of slippage

146
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,320
and delay. Where as if I take additional

147
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:40,020
step, there's two chances of slippage and delay.

148
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:41,860
>> Exactly, that's exactly the right kind of argument to make

149
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:47,130
and, and because the -2 is so big. You're you're going to, you're

150
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:49,150
just better off ending it even if you ended in pain, in

151
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:52,190
the same way that you were in the bottom right hand corner.

152
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:54,580
>> And so bottom left I would say the cleanest thing

153
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:57,390
would be to jump into the -1. So to go to the

154
00:05:57,390 --> 00:06:00,460
right so that I can go up and get into the -1.

155
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:04,120
>> And what's nice about that move is that is that you either end up in the

156
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,440
bottom right hand corner. Or you end up

157
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,170
staying where you are, or you end up moving

158
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:09,980
up. But in either case, you are always

159
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:13,610
sort of, you know, you never get farther away,

160
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:15,220
right? Whereas if you try to go up,

161
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:17,110
there's a chance that you will get farther away.

162
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:19,920
>> Interesting. Is there a way to be sure about these?

163
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,444
>> Yeah, you just have to do the math.

164
00:06:21,444 --> 00:06:23,520
>> [LAUGH]

165
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,310
Do we know how to do the math?

166
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:27,400
>> Yeah, you just start, you just do expectations. You

167
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,700
can basically just say, well what's the expected time. Since

168
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,030
you know what you're trying to do here is to

169
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:34,010
get to the end. You can just, you can calculate the

170
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:36,200
expected length of time it'll take you to get there.

171
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:39,620
And then just, you know, multiply by all the rewards you're

172
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:41,660
going to get in the meantime. If it helps, though, I

173
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:46,110
will tell you that for any value where the reward is

174
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:50,220
less than minus 1.6284.

175
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:51,935
>> [LAUGH]

176
00:06:51,935 --> 00:06:54,040
>> This is the right thing to do.

177
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,260
>> [LAUGH] Okay.

178
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:56,910
>> Just so you know.

179
00:06:56,910 --> 00:06:58,560
>> Alright, so you're saying you actually do know that

180
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,110
this is the optimum. The thing that we have here.

181
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:01,300
>> Yes, I know that this is the optimum.

182
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:04,360
>> Alright. Let me just draw out the rest of it for

183
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:11,110
you. So it's, it's I think interesting to compare this one. The bottom

184
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:14,260
right one, where you have given me negative rewards to encourage

185
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:16,640
me to end the game. With our main one up here in

186
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:19,560
the upper left. Where you have also given me some negative reward

187
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:22,110
to encourage me to end the game. If you look carefully you'll

188
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:27,110
notice that in this one, you're encouraged to end the game.

189
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:29,860
But you're really encouraged to end the game at a plus 1.

190
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:33,400
Here the reward is so strongly negative, you just need to end

191
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:37,600
the game. And so you end up with a different response, here.

192
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,630
Because this is, is just as quick to get to

193
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:41,950
the minus 1 and into pain as to, take this extra

194
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:44,350
step and try to get to the plus 1. And you

195
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:49,350
end up with a different response here. Here, here, and here.

196
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:50,780
>> That's really interesting.

197
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:55,410
>> Yeah, it is. And so, these changes matter. They matter a great deal.

198
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:58,140
>> So, how am I suppose to choose my rewards?

199
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:00,300
>> Carefully and with some forethought.

200
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:00,780
>> Nice.

201
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,640
>> But, you know,

202
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:05,880
again There's lots of ways to think about this. So the way we've been sort of

203
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,820
talking about MDPs is kind of the way

204
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:10,050
we've been talking about we talked in the first

205
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,040
part of the course. When we talked

206
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:16,180
about having teachers and learners. You can think

207
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:17,870
of your reward as sort of the teaching

208
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:21,010
signal. Sort of the teacher telling you what

209
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:23,970
you ought to do, and what you ought not to do. But another way of thinking

210
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:26,440
about this is that because the rewards define

211
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:30,490
the MDP The rewards are our domain knowledge.

212
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:31,780
>> I see.

213
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:34,130
>> So if you're going to design an MDP to

214
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:38,330
capture some world. Then you want to think carefully about how

215
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:41,010
you set the rewards in order to get the behavior that you wish.

216
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:43,159
>> That's fair. I mean, it seems a little bit like

217
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:45,640
a cop out, but I think it seems like a necessary one.

218
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:48,420
>> Yeah. I mean, there's really, I mean, again. No matter what

219
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:51,140
you do, you've gotta be able to inject domain knowledge somehow. Otherwise,

220
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:54,620
there's no learning to do. And in this case, the reward basaiclly

221
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:56,660
is telling you how important it is to get to the end.

222
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:57,530
>> Cool.

223
00:08:57,530 --> 00:08:59,670
>> Okay. Alright. Let's move on.
