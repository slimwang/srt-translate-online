1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,450
Now for the third question, I want you to try something different.

2
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:07,570
Take a moment to think about everything you've learned thus far

3
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:08,160
and write it down.

4
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:13,270
This type of reflection can help us better recall new ideas at a later stage.

5
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,960
I remember my grad school professor used to say,

6
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:21,890
the way to put things in long-term memory, is to describe them to someone else.

7
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:23,890
So, here is your chance to do that.

8
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:27,390
Think about everything you have learnt thus far and write it down.

9
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:30,490
You can either draw an image using pen and paper.

10
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:35,390
Then take a picture of it and share with us using Twitter, LinkedIn or Facebook.

11
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:37,630
Or if you want to keep your work private,

12
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:40,510
you can write down everything that you've learned in this text box.
