00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
In this question we study a particle filter.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Let's just zoom in for a second.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
We have eight particles that land on this checkerboard.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
They are labeled, 'A' all the way to 'H'.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
And some of them are on black squares.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
And some of them are on white squares.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Given those particles,

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
we'll assume that the probability of measuring 'black',

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
for any particle that falls on a black square,

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
is 0.7.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
And the probability of measuring 'white',

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
for any particle that falls on a white square,

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
is 0.6.

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
From that you can easily calculate the probability of measuring 'white',

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
if a particle falls on a black square.

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
And the probability of 'black',

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
if the particle falls on a white square.

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Now I'd like to what's the normalized importance weight, after normalization,

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
of the particle, labeled 'A',

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
if our measurement happens to be 'white'?

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
That's a number that you put in over here.

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
And I'm going to ask you the same question

23
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
about the normalized importance weight of particle 'A',

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
if the measurement is 'black'.

25
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
To calculate this,

26
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
you will go through these probabilities.

27
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
For each particle, you will assign the measurement probability.

28
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
And then you just normalize all of those,

29
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
so they add up to one.
