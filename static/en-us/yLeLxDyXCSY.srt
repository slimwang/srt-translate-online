00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,640
Just ahead in this lesson we're going to see an interface like this.

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:07,300
This is just the audacity code editor.

3
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:11,110
And here's just a python source code file containing a SQL query.

4
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:13,275
You can put anything you like in this query variable here.

5
00:00:13,275 --> 00:00:18,065
And when you press the test run button your query will run on the zoo database.

6
00:00:18,065 --> 00:00:21,975
If the database understands your query, it will give you back a table.

7
00:00:21,975 --> 00:00:23,625
Just go ahead and try it.

8
00:00:23,625 --> 00:00:25,705
We'll be doing a lot of these in the rest of this course.
