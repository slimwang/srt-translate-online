1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:03,610
One of the better-known breaches,
cyber attacks,

2
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:09,440
that occurred towards the end of
2013 was the Target store breach.

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:13,720
So in this case,
you would want to ask this question,

4
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:16,790
what is of value that
somebody was after?

5
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:19,160
And if somebody was after, who was that?

6
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:20,720
What is the threat source?

7
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,550
Then we can say, well,
what vulnerability did they exploit?

8
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:29,710
So the Target case, essentially what
they were after was credit card

9
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:34,970
data that is there on the point-of-sale
systems that are in Target stores.

10
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:38,190
The people who are after
it are cyber criminals

11
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:41,800
because they want to profit
from the stolen information.

12
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:46,020
And the vulnerability they
exploited is an interesting one.

13
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:49,180
So, Target stores had
an HVAC contractor.

14
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:52,120
The hack actually began with a phishing

15
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:55,515
message to an employee
of that HVAC company.

16
00:00:55,515 --> 00:00:59,722
Through that phishing attacks, they
were able to get credentials that gave

17
00:00:59,722 --> 00:01:02,900
the cyber criminals access
to Target's network.

18
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:04,879
And once they were on Target's networks,

19
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,070
then they were able to get to
the point-of-sales systems where they

20
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:11,120
installed malware to siphon
off the credit card numbers.

21
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:14,850
So this is a real-world example
where the security mindset,

22
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:17,270
essentially we are saying,
where does the threat come from?

23
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:18,580
Cyber criminals.

24
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:19,470
What are they after?

25
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:20,510
Credit card data.

26
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:23,970
What vulnerability was there in
the system that was exploited?

27
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:25,110
Well, we just talked about it.
