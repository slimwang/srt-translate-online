00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:04,770
With respect to the three other blackboard qualities, performance,

2
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:08,580
because there's a lack of well-defined control flow, may lead to redundant and

3
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:10,070
administrative behavior.

4
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:12,980
For example, the polling of a repository.

5
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:16,520
Maintainability is enhanced because having independent com,

6
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:20,430
components can lead to in, increased flexibility.

7
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:25,330
But if we make changes to the common control paradigm wherein the blackboard

8
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:29,010
components are updating the repository, or if we change the repository's data

9
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:34,020
format, this can have pervasive negative effects on maintainability.

10
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:39,180
As far as safety is concerned, because the blackboard is a common repository

11
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:43,870
accessible to all the components, if you somehow get bad data un, that

12
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:47,560
might lead to a safety problem, this can easily spread to the other components.
