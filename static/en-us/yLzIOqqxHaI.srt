00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,030
Well, we don't have enough information to figure this out. If you drive a lot

2
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:08,756
of miles, at some point, it must be better to get the more fuel-efficient car.

3
00:00:08,756 --> 00:00:13,740
So, let's say we figure we're going to drive 50,000 miles before we sell the

4
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:18,220
car again or it falls apart. And, of course, it also matters how expensive

5
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:21,890
gasoline is. If gasoline costs nothing, then the fuel efficiency doesn't

6
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:27,450
matter, but we'll assume that gas costs $4 per gallon. Now, that's actually

7
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:31,360
enough information for, to come up with the answer, but how will we decide? I

8
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:35,540
will give you an algorithm, that a computer could actually execute, to settle

9
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:36,120
this question.
