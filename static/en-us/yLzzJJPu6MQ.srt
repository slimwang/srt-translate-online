00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
[Dave] So for question 4, we want to see that you understand

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
how to use and make assignments to variables.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
The question is "Write Python code that stores the distance in meters

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
that light travels in one nanosecond in the variable nanodistance."

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
The variables below are predefined for you.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
We're storing the speed of light in the variable speed_of_light.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
And that's 299,800,000.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
And I have the dot at the end of this to make sure that

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
when you do arithmetic we'll get decimal variables instead

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
of just doing integer arithmetic on the speed of light.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The second variable is nano_per_second,

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
and there are 1 billion nanoseconds in 1 second.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
And your goal is to write code that assigns to the variable

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
nanodistance the distance in meters that light travels in 1 nanosecond.

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
And if you've done that correctly, after you run your code,

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
when you print the value of nanodistance,

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
it should output 0.2998,

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
indicating that light travels almost 30 centimeters in 1 nanosecond.
