1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:05,850
So, now that we know that the cache is
a small memory inside our processor

2
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:10,660
where we are trying to find the data
before we go to the main memory.

3
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:14,720
Let's take some time and
recap what we need out of cache.

4
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:16,090
We need it to be fast.

5
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:18,320
Which means it has to be small.

6
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,890
Because it's small,
not everything will fit.

7
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:26,440
There will be a lot of memory
locations that we do not have room for

8
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:27,600
in our cache.

9
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:32,640
So when a processor wants to access
some memory, we can have a cache hit,

10
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,100
which occurs when we find what
we are looking for in the cache.

11
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:40,190
The memory location we are interested in
was already brought from the memory to

12
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:41,530
the cache before.

13
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:45,760
So now we're accessing it, and
we can just find it in the cache.

14
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,520
And the access is then very quick,
so this is what we want.

15
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:54,700
We want fast accesses for
most of our memory accesses,

16
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:57,390
and that happens when we
have a lot of cache hits.

17
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:59,270
But because the cache is very small and

18
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:03,440
not everything fits in it,
we can also have a cache miss.

19
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:07,110
This happens when what we're looking for
is not in the cache, and in that case,

20
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:09,330
we have to access the slow memory.

21
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:13,550
When we have a cache miss, we want to
copy this location to the cache so

22
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:17,070
that next time we access it, and
hopefully we will because of locality,

23
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:19,500
we will have a cache hit.

24
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:24,000
So it is necessary to have cache misses
because that's how we really bring

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,950
stuff into the cache
in order to have hits.

26
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:31,820
The more locality we have,
the more cache hits we will have and

27
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:33,180
the fewer cache misses.

28
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:35,990
Because one miss will bring
the data into the cache and

29
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:38,990
then hopefully we will use it many,
many times.

30
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:43,630
When we a cache miss, that is slow,
that access is going to take some time.

31
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:45,300
But that should happen very rarely.

32
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:48,060
Most of the time when we need something,
we find it in the cache.

33
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:51,080
Or, at least we hope to do that.

34
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,670
And we want to design our caches so
that that's how it works.
