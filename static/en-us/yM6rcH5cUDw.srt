00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:03,730
A key piece of data,
medication compliance,

2
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:08,100
has remained very difficult to
obtain in a cost effective manner,

3
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:11,670
despite a great deal of research
in commercial activity.

4
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:16,020
Devices and software
are available to remind patients,

5
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:20,170
to monitor when they open
a special pill container, and

6
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:23,700
to even dispense the proper
medications at the right time.

7
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:28,040
There are continuing challenges with
usability, and with updating the more

8
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:31,920
advanced devices when medication
orders change, as they often do.

9
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,280
The gold standard would be knowing
that patients actually consume their

10
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:40,270
medications at the proper time,
and in the proper dose.
