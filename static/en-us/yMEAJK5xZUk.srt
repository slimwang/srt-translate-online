00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,270
In the next few videos, I will show
you how to implement this flow

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:05,130
on your restaurant menu application.

3
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:08,250
If you have already taken full stack
foundations, you're familiar with

4
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:11,800
the restaurant menu app that you
created by the end of this course.

5
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:15,340
Here in this course I have that same
project with some added bootstrap and

6
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:18,630
styling to make it a little
more aesthetically pleasing.

7
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:22,420
In this lesson, you'll add the Google OS
log in to this web application.

8
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:25,310
In the instructor notes I provided
some instructions on downloading and

9
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:27,210
running a copy of this
code on your own machine.
