Your personality is what makes you uniquely and consistently you. Personality

2
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:10,445
is defined as an individual's pattern of thinking, feeling and behaving. Now,

3
00:00:10,445 --> 00:00:14,590
let's take this hypothetical situation. What if I just met Rosio and I see her

4
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:18,820
acting in an unfriendly way? Am I likely to conclude that she's an unfriendly

5
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:24,248
person? Well, I might. But that might not be correct. Because I've only seen

6
00:00:24,248 --> 00:00:28,008
her acting this way in that one situation. I haven't seen her under many

7
00:00:28,008 --> 00:00:31,713
circumstances over a long period of time, and those are two things that we need

8
00:00:31,713 --> 00:00:37,050
if we're going to make a conclusion about someone's personality. We just know

9
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:41,460
something about the mood she was in, or how she was behaving that day.

10
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:44,988
Everybody acts differently sometimes. The most introverted person can light up

11
00:00:44,988 --> 00:00:49,482
when they're around their friends. The kindest person can sometimes be angry or

12
00:00:49,482 --> 00:00:54,580
even hostile. But personality is how we behave most of the time.
