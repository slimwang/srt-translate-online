1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,020
Now before we close, there's one
other thing I want to touch on.

2
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:06,200
It's called Arbitrage Pricing Theory.

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:10,522
Arbitrage Pricing Theory was
developed by Stephen Ross and

4
00:00:10,522 --> 00:00:12,775
first published in 1976.

5
00:00:12,775 --> 00:00:15,549
So Dr. Ross observed the CAPM as it was.

6
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:20,150
But he said look,
we have this single beta

7
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:23,440
that represents a particular
stock's relationship to the market.

8
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,454
Maybe really we ought
to have multiple betas.

9
00:00:25,454 --> 00:00:32,920
The CAPM is really only allowing us to
consider a stock in the entire ocean.

10
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:36,400
And his idea, if you continue the sort
of analogy we've been doing in this

11
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:41,000
class, is that we ought to
consider the different islands.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:41,600
In other words,

13
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:46,710
a particular stock might have exposure
to different aspects of the market.

14
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:51,390
So, the stock might have
some exposure to finance, so

15
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:56,300
we could compute the component of
return due to finance via the beta

16
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:59,220
with regard to finance and
the return for finance of that day.

17
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:06,720
So we could compute for each stock,
for each sector, and individual beta.

18
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:11,160
And so his assertion was that
by breaking out the betas

19
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:13,650
into these different factors,

20
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:17,860
we could get a more accurate forecast of
what the return's going to look like.

21
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:20,890
And of course we still
have our alpha over here.

22
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:26,290
We're not going to use APT in this
class, but since we've been going

23
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:30,980
forward with this analogy of oceans and
islands and so on, I wanted to bring

24
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:34,080
it to your attention because I
thought you might find it interesting.

25
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,560
Okay, that's it for
the capital assets pricing model.

26
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,530
I'll see you again soon.
