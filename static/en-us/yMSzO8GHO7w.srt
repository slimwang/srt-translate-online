1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:03,540
Even more important than the selection
of the treatment stores,

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:06,230
is the selection of the control stores.

3
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:09,240
These stores will become the baseline
for the analysis of the experiment.

4
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:13,560
As mentioned before, the process for
selecting treatment and

5
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:15,530
control stores is known
as matched pairing.

6
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:20,590
Matched pairing is where each treatment
store is matched to a control store

7
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:23,830
that has very similar measures for
each of the control variables.

8
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:28,580
In our new product experiment,
we chose three control variables,

9
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:34,060
sales volume, number of products sold
and state where the store is located.

10
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:37,350
In the matched pairing process,
for each treatment store,

11
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:41,740
we would want to select a control store
that has close to the same sales volume,

12
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:45,190
close to the same number of products
sold, and is in the same state.
