1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,419
Let's go ahead and expand this node now.

2
00:00:02,419 --> 00:00:04,035
So we're going to add three paths.

3
00:00:04,035 --> 00:00:08,022
This one has a path cost of 291.

4
00:00:08,022 --> 00:00:13,974
And an estimated distance to
the goal of 380 for a total of 671.

5
00:00:13,974 --> 00:00:16,847
This one has a path costs of 239 and

6
00:00:16,847 --> 00:00:21,149
an estimated distance of 176 for
a total of 415.

7
00:00:21,149 --> 00:00:26,338
And the final one is 220
plus 193 equals 413.

8
00:00:26,338 --> 00:00:31,250
And now the question is which
state do we expand next.
