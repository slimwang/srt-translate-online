1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:03,770
Eliminating redundant data structures can help save memory

2
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:06,754
in the control program running at the controller. Only

3
00:00:06,754 --> 00:00:10,580
performing ,a fixed number of network management operations

4
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:13,040
such as routing, can insure that the controller doesn't

5
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,250
have to do too much, thereby improving scalability.

6
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:19,700
Caching forwarding decisions, that the control plain has already

7
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:23,010
made ,in the switches, can ensure ,that not

8
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:26,610
to much traffic, is redirected to the controller, and

9
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:30,390
running multiple controllers can distribute the load of

10
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:33,980
the control plane across multiple replicas, sending all

11
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:37,020
traffic to the controller only increases the controller

12
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:39,630
load, and would not help with scale ability.
