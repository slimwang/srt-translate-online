00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:03,270
Welcome to the DevOps Nanodegree.

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:05,790
I'm Julia,
a Project Manager here at Udacity.

3
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:11,520
I will be guiding you through your first
steps in learning more about DevOps.

4
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:15,500
DevOps developed organically from people
who are at the forefront of developing

5
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,310
software for the Internet.

6
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:20,410
These people came from all
different types of backgrounds.

7
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:22,500
Some might have a similar
background to you and

8
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:23,790
some might be completely different.

9
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:28,730
But they all have a single goal
to improve collaboration and

10
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:30,770
efficiency throughout
their organizations.

11
00:00:32,424 --> 00:00:37,080
DevOps is a practice that emerged from
agile development and lean management.

12
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:41,020
One thing all of these systems have
in common is continuous improvement.

13
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:46,900
DevOps is not just about buying
software or holding a one day training.

14
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:50,600
It's a journey that will take time,
effort and commitment.

15
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,700
You'll need to balance the needs of
many different groups within your

16
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:58,190
organization as you implement
wide scale cultural changes.

17
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:02,090
Well, it's up to you to take the first
steps, we will be here to support and

18
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:03,369
guide you along the way.

19
00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:07,320
In the process we'll look at tools
that can help you manage some of

20
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,600
the technical challenges.

21
00:01:09,952 --> 00:01:12,962
Although DevOps won't magically
solve all of your problems,

22
00:01:12,962 --> 00:01:17,830
following DevOps practices will help
your team to improve collaboration and

23
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:21,500
work flow throughout the whole
software development life cycle.

24
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:26,790
DevOps did not become popular because
somebody forced its adoption.

25
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:29,820
It's popular because it works and
it makes teams and

26
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:32,230
companies more successful.

27
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:33,840
Excited to learn more?

28
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:34,540
Let's jump in.
