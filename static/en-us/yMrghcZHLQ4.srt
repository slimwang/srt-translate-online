00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:06,687
If you got 5x minus 2y equals negative 4, you did a great job. Let's see how we

2
00:00:06,687 --> 00:00:12,975
got that answer. Remember, the first thing we have to do is find the slope

3
00:00:12,975 --> 00:00:19,412
between these two points. We know that the equation for slope is y2 minus y1

4
00:00:19,412 --> 00:00:25,399
over x2 minus x1. Now, to make sure I put the values in the right places, I

5
00:00:25,399 --> 00:00:31,876
always label one of the my points, x1, y1 and the other point, x2, y2. That way,

6
00:00:31,876 --> 00:00:38,221
I make sure I plug them into the right places. So when I find the slope, y2

7
00:00:38,221 --> 00:00:45,541
minus y1 is, y2 is 7, minus y1 is negative 3 over x2 which is 2 minus x1 which

8
00:00:45,541 --> 00:00:53,804
is negative 2. 7 minus negative 3 is 10. 2 minus negative 2 is 4 and 10 over 4

9
00:00:53,804 --> 00:01:02,147
can be reduced to 5 halves. So we know that the slope of our line. So we know

10
00:01:02,147 --> 00:01:08,727
the slope of our line is 5 halves. Now that we know the slope, we can find the

11
00:01:08,727 --> 00:01:14,145
equation of the line. In order to find the equation of the line, we use the

12
00:01:14,145 --> 00:01:19,620
equation m equals y minus y1 over x minus x1. Now I plug in what I know. The

13
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:26,172
slope is 5 halves, and that's going to equal y minus y1, y1 is negative 3 over x

14
00:01:26,172 --> 00:01:34,854
minus x1 which is x minus negative 2. Let's go ahead and write these again. 5

15
00:01:34,854 --> 00:01:43,211
halves equals y minus negative 3 is y plus 3 and x minus a negative 2 is x plus

16
00:01:43,211 --> 00:01:50,887
2. Now I can simply cross multiply. When I cross multiply, I have 5 times x plus

17
00:01:50,887 --> 00:01:58,577
2 equals 2 times y plus 3. I have to remember to distribute. After I distribute,

18
00:01:58,577 --> 00:02:05,204
I have 5x, plus 5 times 2 is 10, equals 2y plus 2 times 3 is 6. Since I want

19
00:02:05,204 --> 00:02:11,000
this equation in standard form, I'd need the x and y terms on the left side and

20
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,846
the constant on the right side. So, I can subtract 10 from both sides to move

21
00:02:16,846 --> 00:02:22,901
the constant over to the right. And I have 5x equals 2y minus 4. 6 plus negative

22
00:02:22,901 --> 00:02:29,810
10 is negative 4. And then I have to subtract 2y from both sides. And I get a

23
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:34,994
final answer of 5x minus 2y equals negative 4.
