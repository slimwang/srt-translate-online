1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,259
In the very first module of these
nano degree program, you used

2
00:00:03,259 --> 00:00:06,639
some basic computer vision techniques
to find the lane lines on the road.

3
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:09,859
The first thing you'll do in these
module, is to write a better lane

4
00:00:09,859 --> 00:00:13,589
finding algorithm that deals with
complex scenarios like curving lines,

5
00:00:13,589 --> 00:00:16,390
shadows and
changes in the color of the pavement.

6
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:18,920
You'll measure things like how
much the lane is curving and

7
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:21,460
where your vehicle is
with respect to center.

8
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:24,320
These are the kinds of measurements you
ultimately need to make in order to

9
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:24,960
control the car.

10
00:00:26,019 --> 00:00:29,820
>> After that, you'll implement
vehicle detection and tracking.

11
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,840
While deciding when to change lanes,
when to accelerate, and

12
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,870
when to hit the brakes, knowing where
the other vehicles are on the road

13
00:00:37,869 --> 00:00:40,659
is crucial to
the decision-making process.

14
00:00:40,659 --> 00:00:43,869
Trust me, I have friends who
change lanes without looking, and

15
00:00:43,869 --> 00:00:44,829
it doesn't end well.

16
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:49,079
>> The project for
this module will come in two pieces.

17
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:51,070
First, the advanced lane-finding piece.

18
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:53,939
And second, the vehicle detection and
tracking piece.

19
00:00:53,939 --> 00:00:57,259
At the end, you'll combine these two
pieces to simultaneously measure

20
00:00:57,259 --> 00:01:00,280
where the car is on the road,
where the road is going, and

21
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,469
the location of other vehicles
in your field of view.
