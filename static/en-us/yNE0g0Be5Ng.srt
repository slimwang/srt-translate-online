1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:01,700
Hey, Andy. How'd it go?

2
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:02,800
>> It went okay.

3
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,059
I have two cats and

4
00:00:04,059 --> 00:00:06,900
it's working, but the whole process was a little frustrating.

5
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:08,250
>> Frustrating in what way?

6
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:10,820
>> So you're not going to like this, but I.

7
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:12,160
>> oh. >> Basically just copied and

8
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:16,500
pasted all my code from, you know, the first cat, made a second cat.

9
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:17,640
Had a cat one and a cat two.

10
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,950
Account one and account two and all that sort of thing.

11
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:21,980
>> It seems like a quick and easy method, right?

12
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:23,910
>> It was quick, but it wasn't easy.

13
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:25,290
>> Why? Wait, why not?

14
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:27,750
>> So I forgot to change one of the ones to a two, and so

15
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:32,490
when I clicked on one of the cats, it kept incrementing both of the cats, and

16
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:35,680
that isn't the best, the best way to do things.

17
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:36,360
>> I see.

18
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,090
Now here's another question.

19
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:42,880
If hypothetically, I were to ask you to scale this from two cats to say,

20
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,730
five cats.

21
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:46,440
What would you say?

22
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,190
Like, does it, is it scalable?

23
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:49,168
>> Part of me wants to say no.

24
00:00:49,168 --> 00:00:50,748
[LAUGH] I don't want to do that.

25
00:00:50,748 --> 00:00:53,186
[LAUGH]. >> But this method probably wouldn't, and I,

26
00:00:53,186 --> 00:00:56,760
obviously this method would not be the best way to do it.

27
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,390
sure, it could work.

28
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:00,500
I would probably want to find a better way to do it.

29
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,660
>> That's probably a wise approach.

30
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:03,660
Yeah.

31
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:07,440
Now if I were hypothetically to ask you and Andy to do this, and

32
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:11,250
scale up to five cats, there is one thing that you probably should be aware of,

33
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:13,410
and that has to do with closures.

34
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:16,910
When you're adding eventless centers to elements, several elements,

35
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:20,800
in a closure inside of a loop, there's an easy trap you can fall into.

36
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,760
Now, the next node is going to be a reading node.

37
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:26,020
It's going to tell you information about when you might fall into that trap, and

38
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:26,650
how to get out of it.
