1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,990
Now that we've introduced these factors
and to find them, we're now able to

2
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:08,890
describe the fundamental law as
expressed by Richard Grinold.

3
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:11,430
And it's simple, it's just this.

4
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:16,730
He was able to show mathematically
that information ratio

5
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:21,580
is equal to information coefficient
times the square root of breadth.

6
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:26,140
I'm just going to present it without
proof here and encourage you to go look

7
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:30,440
at Grinold's book if you're interested,
for more detail.

8
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,530
So, performance of the manager, or

9
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:38,270
the fund, is due to the skill
at making predictions.

10
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:40,410
Times the square root of breadth.

11
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:44,650
So that means, for instance, that yes,
you may be very skilled but you've got

12
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:48,930
to have opportunities to invest in
order to operationalize your skill.

13
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:54,500
Now if you want to improve your
performance you can either

14
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:58,770
focus on improving your skill or
focus on improving your breadth.

15
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:04,290
Sometimes it turns out,
that it's a lot easier to increase

16
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:08,860
breadth by finding additional stocks you
might look at or additional markets.

17
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:12,900
You might have some commodity
trading strategy that works great.

18
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:16,040
You can increase your breadth by
looking at additional commodities.

19
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:21,510
However, the strength of this increase,
in other words, as you increase breadth,

20
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:25,890
the overall performance only increases
as the square root of that breadth.

21
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,170
So it tapers off after
some amount of time.

22
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:33,200
It turns out, though, that it's very,
very hard to improve your skill, so

23
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,040
that is why,

24
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:38,610
for instance, folks often focus on
the breadth component of this equation.
