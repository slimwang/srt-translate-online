1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:03,682
You might be enticed to start your
design work for larger screens.

2
00:00:03,682 --> 00:00:07,810
After all, everyone has these humongous
phones and tablets these days, right?

3
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:10,740
While the average size of phones and
tablets is growing,

4
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:13,850
we're going to consciously design for
the smaller sizes first.

5
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:15,160
If you design an interface for

6
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:18,280
a phone screen,
it's still usable on a tablet screen.

7
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:20,638
It might have lots of white space and
look odd, but

8
00:00:20,638 --> 00:00:22,050
the app will still work fine.

9
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:25,870
Now you can't see the same for
a tablet UI viewed on a phone.

10
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:29,300
That'd be really hard to use,
all those little touch targets.

11
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:32,830
Starting with small screens also
really helps you simplify and

12
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:35,430
prioritize what should go into the UI.

13
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:38,870
At each step we want to carefully
consider which elements, if any,

14
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:40,140
to add to larger screens.
