1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:02,760
All right.
We're one day closer to launch.

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:04,689
And we've got tons of
traffic on the site.

3
00:00:04,689 --> 00:00:06,810
Things are looking pretty great.

4
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:08,640
>> Excellent,
well I just booked my trip to Hawaii.

5
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:12,072
With the launch so close,
I'm sure nothing could go wrong.

6
00:00:12,072 --> 00:00:13,938
>> [LAUGH] Yeah.

7
00:00:13,938 --> 00:00:15,430
That's funny.

8
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:16,314
>> What?

9
00:00:16,314 --> 00:00:18,630
>> It's probably nothing.

10
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:20,539
I don't know, but
take look at the data structure.

11
00:00:20,539 --> 00:00:23,510
I must have not deleted one
of my test shopping lists.

12
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:26,190
Hm, these are data seems to
have a couple of fields that

13
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:28,740
I don't really remember
putting in there.

14
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:31,245
And some of these emails
look a little bit off.

15
00:00:31,245 --> 00:00:34,380
Man, I must be really out of it.

16
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:36,240
It should be easy that to fix though.

17
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,634
>> What if while you're fixing that,

18
00:00:37,634 --> 00:00:41,480
you also future-proofed your data by
creating Firebase security rules?

19
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:44,650
This would help both make sure you don't
accidentally introduce anything to your

20
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:46,790
data structure you didn't mean to, and

21
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:50,000
protect your app against those
with malicious intentions.

22
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,980
>> Well, it does look like we have
a little bit more time before lunch.

23
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:55,680
Hey, developer, are you still with us?

24
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,140
Maybe we could talk a little
bit about security.
