00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,885
Great Android apps use context to
produce experiences that are useful to

2
00:00:04,885 --> 00:00:07,410
users at the right time and
the right place.

3
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:10,140
Our watch face can show users
contextually relevent data and

4
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:12,590
react to it by changing styles and
colors in your design.

5
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:16,390
The first step in designing
a data integrated watch face

6
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:18,060
is to define the end result.

7
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:21,680
What information that's available to
your app do you want your users to know

8
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,800
after they've glanced at your design?

9
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:27,710
Your watch face might use data other
than time, such as weather, calendar, or

10
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:28,810
fitness data.

11
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:30,760
Consider including data creatively.

12
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:34,420
Avoid simply overlaying a time-based
watch face with extra data.

13
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:38,010
Rather, think about how the data can
be expressed through the lens of time.

14
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:40,960
For example, instead of designing
a weather-related watch face as

15
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,490
a clock with indication of the current
temperature in degrees overlayed,

16
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:47,440
you might design a watch face like this
that describes how the temperature

17
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:51,000
will change over the course of the day,
rain, then sun.

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,340
You could use colors to indicate
the kind of weather there might be.

19
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,480
There are lots of possibilities.

20
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:58,170
And, remember,
keep in mind glanceability for the user.

21
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:01,050
They're going to be looking at this
watch face a lot during the day.

22
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:02,230
Less is really more here.

23
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:04,220
The simpler your message,
the stronger it will be.
