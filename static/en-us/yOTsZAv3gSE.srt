1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:02,750
Here's a solution to this exercise.

2
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:06,849
For the first example where we want the
content URI for the entire pets table.

3
00:00:06,849 --> 00:00:09,504
We started off with our scheme, and for

4
00:00:09,504 --> 00:00:13,140
content URIs remember
it's always content://.

5
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:17,120
Next part is the content authority,
which tells us the content provider.

6
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:20,435
In this case,
we've set up the content authority to be

7
00:00:20,435 --> 00:00:26,910
com.example.android.pets, and the last
part of it is the pets table name,

8
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:32,119
and this tells us that we want
information from the entire pets table.

9
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:36,090
Now similarly for the second case,
where we want information but

10
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:41,055
just from a single row, we have the same
scheme, the same content authority,

11
00:00:41,055 --> 00:00:46,775
and the same pets table name but
we want to specify the row ID here.

12
00:00:46,775 --> 00:00:52,365
We end it with /2 because we want
the pet in the second row of the table.

13
00:00:52,365 --> 00:00:56,459
And this is assuming that the table
starts counting from one.
