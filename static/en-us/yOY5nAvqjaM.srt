00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,980
To see some concrete
examples of interpolation,

2
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:07,380
I've put together this little app,
and it has two spinners here.

3
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:13,085
The first one has a list of a bunch
of different interpolators like

4
00:00:14,365 --> 00:00:20,585
accelerate, decelerate, bounce,
decelerate, linear, overshoot.

5
00:00:20,585 --> 00:00:23,655
And the second spinner
has different timings,

6
00:00:23,655 --> 00:00:28,366
from 100 milliseconds all the way
up to 3,000 milliseconds or

7
00:00:28,366 --> 00:00:33,512
three seconds, so that you can see
how fast or how slow things work.

8
00:00:33,512 --> 00:00:39,826
So if we just select 3,000 milliseconds,
it's going to be really slow.

9
00:00:39,826 --> 00:00:44,956
And just like Roman was saying in the
previous video, it's kind of gratuitous

10
00:00:44,956 --> 00:00:49,406
to, and it's just too much motion to
be bouncing up and down that much.

11
00:00:49,406 --> 00:00:53,496
So let's try, maybe a 900 milliseconds.

12
00:00:55,586 --> 00:00:57,906
That looks a little bit better.

13
00:00:57,906 --> 00:01:00,196
So let's switch to the code and
see how this works.

14
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:04,540
So here's the code that makes that work.

15
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:08,540
We start off with creating a new
instance of our interpolator.

16
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:13,380
Because it's different based off of what
the name is, we actually use the Java

17
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:17,400
class forName to get the class and
then instantiate a new instance.

18
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:22,222
But if you were using this in your
own app, you would call, say,

19
00:01:22,222 --> 00:01:26,010
new BounceInterpolator directly.

20
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:31,790
So after we have that,
we call animate on our text view, and

21
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:36,490
set the interpolator and
the duration from our spinner, and

22
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:40,540
tell it to start in 500 milliseconds and

23
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:45,640
to move the animation from the bottom
of the screen, and then start.

24
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,880
Check the instructor's notes for

25
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,180
more information about interpolators or
this sample app

26
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:53,150
that you can play around with to see
how they work a little bit better.
