1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:06,193
The answer is this one,
220 is less than 229, or 239.

2
00:00:06,193 --> 00:00:10,117
Take it out the front here,
put it on explored.

3
00:00:10,117 --> 00:00:15,629
Add in two more paths, then sum them up.

4
00:00:15,628 --> 00:00:23,579
So 220 plus 146 is 366 and

5
00:00:23,579 --> 00:00:30,164
220 plus 97 is 317.

6
00:00:30,164 --> 00:00:35,143
Okay and now notice that we're closing
in on Bucharest we've got two neighbors

7
00:00:35,143 --> 00:00:36,118
almost there.

8
00:00:36,118 --> 00:00:39,578
But neither of them has their turn yet
Instead,

9
00:00:39,578 --> 00:00:44,862
the cheapest path is this one over here,
so move it to the explored list.

10
00:00:44,862 --> 00:00:49,593
Add 70 to the path cost so

11
00:00:49,593 --> 00:00:53,682
far and we get 299.

12
00:00:53,682 --> 00:00:58,730
Now the cheapest node is 239 here so

13
00:00:58,729 --> 00:01:05,840
we expand finally into
Bucharest at a cost of 460.

14
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,743
And now the question is, are we done?

15
00:01:08,743 --> 00:01:09,977
Can we terminate the object?

16
00:01:09,977 --> 00:01:11,908
