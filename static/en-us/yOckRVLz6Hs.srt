00:00:00,262 --> 00:00:04,420
Okay, so not everything
about drop downs is all bad.

2
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:08,781
For instance, the ability to give users
a predefined list of options actually

3
00:00:08,781 --> 00:00:09,844
can come in handy.

4
00:00:09,844 --> 00:00:14,465
It's just that forcing users to
scroll through massive lists of

5
00:00:14,465 --> 00:00:16,184
options can be tiring.

6
00:00:16,184 --> 00:00:19,552
And it's not very flexible because
they have to pick one of the options.

7
00:00:19,552 --> 00:00:24,461
Incidentally, there is one kind of
input that combines the helpfulness

8
00:00:24,461 --> 00:00:28,806
of a pre-defined list with
the flexibility of a text input, and

9
00:00:28,806 --> 00:00:31,700
it's called the data list.

10
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:32,362
Here's an example.

11
00:00:32,362 --> 00:00:36,873
With the data list, you still get
a pre-defined list of options, but

12
00:00:36,873 --> 00:00:39,254
users also have the ability to type.

13
00:00:39,254 --> 00:00:44,841
And as users type, they will see
options from the list get suggested.

14
00:00:44,841 --> 00:00:50,310
But this doesn't mean that users
have to use one of the options.

15
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:51,620
They can actually keep typing.

16
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:55,563
This makes data lists a nice,
flexible solution.

17
00:00:55,563 --> 00:00:57,813
The syntax is pretty simple.

18
00:00:57,813 --> 00:01:02,399
Rather than putting options in a select
tag, put them in a data list tag.

19
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:07,523
Each option should have a value set to
whatever value you want it to take,

20
00:01:07,523 --> 00:01:10,640
and you'll need to give
the data list an id.

21
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,548
The input should have a list attribute,
and

22
00:01:13,548 --> 00:01:17,016
the list attribute should
match the datalist an ID.

23
00:01:17,016 --> 00:01:19,326
Check the Instructor notes for
more information.

24
00:01:19,326 --> 00:01:22,785
For this quiz you're going to be
building the data list you just saw.

25
00:01:22,785 --> 00:01:26,049
I'll be giving you a version
of the demo with a dropdown,

26
00:01:26,049 --> 00:01:29,020
and you'll be turning it into this.

27
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:32,310
As always, don't forget to take a look
at the instructor notes, and good luck.
