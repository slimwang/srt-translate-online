00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
This being a course on software debugging, let's take a look at a software problem.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Mozilla is the corporation that produces the well-known Firefox browser.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
In the early days of the browser, Mozilla was still in beta,

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
and they got lots and lots of problem reports from their early customers.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Here is bug report #24735.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
You already see from the number that they got very, very many bug reports.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
What would happen here is that a user would start the Mozilla browser,

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
would go to the website bugzilla.mozilla.org,

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
which actually holds all the bug reports, including this one, in Mozilla.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
The browser would render the Bugzilla webpage.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
There would be a link "search for bug" and users would click on it.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Then a number of menus would appear say selecting the operating system,

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
priority or severity, where you would be able to enter or select search terms

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
before pressing the big search button.

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
If the user would now, with this Bugzilla page open,

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:06,000
select "Print" from the menu, then the entire browser would crash with a segmentation fault.

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Such bug reports were not exactly uncommon in the early days of Mozilla.

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
There would always be some HTML input that would come from the web server

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
and then be rendered as a webpage which the browser couldn't properly handle.

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Let's take a look at the HTML code for bugzilla.mozilla.org.
