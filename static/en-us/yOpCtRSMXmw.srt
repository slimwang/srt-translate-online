00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,350
So, now that you know that pieces
of code like this one can cause

2
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:07,440
forced synchronous layout,
what can you reasonably do to avoid it?

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,040
Should you completely avoid reading
layout properties with JavaScript?

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,660
Should you read layout properties and
then batch your style changes?

5
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:17,250
In your loops,
should you change the styles first and

6
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:19,090
then read layout properties?

7
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:22,010
Or should you never change
styles using JavaScript?

8
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:23,340
Pick one of these four answers.
