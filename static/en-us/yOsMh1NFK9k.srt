1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,980
Couple little things to look at remaining.

2
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:07,280
The first is the impact of noise on the Hough transform.

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:10,400
So here what you can see is an image on the left where we've taken that

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:15,110
same cartoon set of dots and we perturbed them a little bit off the line.

5
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:17,910
So we've added a little bit of noise to their location.

6
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:19,820
On the right, you see the Hough votes.

7
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:24,920
And you'll notice that now, the peak, not so precise.

8
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:30,100
And in fact, if we had very, very fine bins, we might miss that peak altogether.

9
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:33,500
So, in a minute we're going to talk a little bit about changing bin sizes,

10
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,760
with respect to noise, as a, a way of making the thing work.

11
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:41,270
But, what happens is that small amounts of noise can bump you off.

12
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:44,420
So by the way, one really kind of cool thing you could do,

13
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:48,780
if you wanted to find sort of the general peak over here, what might you do?

14
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:52,760
You might smooth this image, right?

15
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:55,770
You could actually take a,

16
00:00:55,770 --> 00:01:00,280
say a filtering of that as an image, then find the peaks.

17
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,382
And now you know you've moved the peaks around a little bit because

18
00:01:02,382 --> 00:01:03,200
you blurred it.

19
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:06,240
But now you at least found the peak, and you say, I'm going to do

20
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:11,800
the Hough transform again, but this time I'm going to just focus on that area.

21
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:15,510
Okay, so I'm going to build a new array with much finer bins but only there, and

22
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:18,630
if d or theta are outside there, I'm not even going to count those votes and

23
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:21,810
that would let you go from a noisy image to, to a better one.

24
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,730
There's actually another problem.

25
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:27,210
What happens if we have a lot of noise?

26
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:29,950
Like, suppose all we have is noise.

27
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:32,320
Here on the left, what you've got is a bunch of points that are put down,

28
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,800
that are just randomly put there.

29
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,565
And on the right, everybody gets the vote.

30
00:01:37,565 --> 00:01:38,890
Lara Croft or whoever you want.

31
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:40,210
Go ahead and vote.

32
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:42,810
Turns out there were no real candidates.

33
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:44,660
But maybe we don't know that.

34
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:46,840
You can accidentally find peaks.

35
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,500
So sometimes you have to worry about,

36
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,770
is the peak that I'm finding actually real or not?

37
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:54,620
It's helpful if you already know, let's suppose you know there's six lines in

38
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:57,030
the picture, well then you just find the six highest peaks, but

39
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:59,910
if you don't know how many are there, you have this question of, when is a peak

40
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:03,290
a real peak and when is it just the accidental alignment of votes?
