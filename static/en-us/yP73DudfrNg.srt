1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:03,100
OK, so let's go through the solution. A news site

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:07,390
like New York Times, absolutely. It's an internet service, it

3
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:09,690
has lots of users and the load on the service

4
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:12,440
probably varies so the scaling of app engine could be used

5
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:16,320
a perfect match. What about a device driver testing system?

6
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:19,970
Well, it of course depends on what kind of system this

7
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:22,650
is but just the fact that device driver is part

8
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:25,610
of the title, make you think that it needs access to

9
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:29,540
low level resources within in a computer. Remember, app

10
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:32,780
engines are generic platform to build scalable applications and

11
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:35,120
from that perspective this does not sound like a

12
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:39,660
match. What about a personal portfolio site? Just because

13
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:41,980
it's a personal site and probably does not need

14
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:44,610
massive scale, does not mean that app engine can

15
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:47,700
not be of great use. App engine simplifies development

16
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:51,440
of server-side applications greatly, so this is a good match.

17
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:56,600
What about a video game? Well, if we just mean the user interface part then

18
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,700
app engine is not a good match, app

19
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:00,960
engine is used to develop server side applications.
