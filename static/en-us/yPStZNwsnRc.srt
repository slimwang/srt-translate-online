00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:01,660
Okay, time for a quiz.

2
00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:07,740
Suppose there are two processes, each of
which executes the following operations.

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:13,365
So, they each try to send messages and
they each try to receive messages.

4
00:00:13,365 --> 00:00:15,205
The buffer for receiving is called text.

5
00:00:16,265 --> 00:00:17,025
Here's my question.

6
00:00:18,025 --> 00:00:21,655
What is the value of text
when the processes complete?

7
00:00:21,655 --> 00:00:23,695
Does rank one's text
have the value hello,

8
00:00:23,695 --> 00:00:26,565
while rank two has the value world?

9
00:00:26,565 --> 00:00:27,741
Or is it just the reverse?

10
00:00:27,741 --> 00:00:31,335
Or maybe it's either,
or maybe it's neither.

11
00:00:31,335 --> 00:00:33,845
Or maybe the processes
don't even complete.

12
00:00:33,845 --> 00:00:34,475
You decide.
