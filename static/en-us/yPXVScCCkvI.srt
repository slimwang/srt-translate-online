1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:06,710
Okay, so in cycle 13 we have seen that this instruction begins executing and

2
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:11,530
also the rob six instruction was dispatched because it captured the same result.

3
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:15,990
And begins executing, and it will eventually go towards the value of three.

4
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:19,690
The question for you is in addition to basically this instructions capturing

5
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:25,000
values in this batching, does anything else happen in cycle 13?

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,680
Right here, what happens, issue, execution, write of result or

7
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:35,180
commit, just write one letter. And the number of the ROB entry here. So for

8
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:41,870
example, if you think that instruction ROB two writes result, write W two, here.
