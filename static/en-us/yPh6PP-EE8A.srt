00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,719
Now that you've seen the nuts and
bolts of this app all in code,

2
00:00:02,719 --> 00:00:06,390
let's take another look at how
Storyboard represents objects.

3
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:09,830
Storyboard has three different
ways of showing our objects.

4
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:14,690
In an expandable outline view,
in a visual canvas view, and

5
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:16,740
in the text editor itself.

6
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:19,400
It's important to find all three
of these to be sure you're

7
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,910
confident manipulating outlets.

8
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:25,770
To start out with let's focus on
this ViewController.swift file.

9
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:29,850
The first thing you're going to want to
do is delete any extra code you have

10
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:34,100
in this viewDidLoad method leftover from
when we built this app programmatically.

11
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:38,570
Make sure you hold on to these
two properties that we made.

12
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:41,220
And also this increment count method.

13
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:45,470
Right now, Storyboard doesn't know about
this label property that we've created.

14
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:49,700
But we can change that by adding
at IBOutlet in front of it.

15
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:53,410
This is how storyboard's
going to recognize this property.

16
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:56,015
Notice that when a property
is marked as an IBOutlet,

17
00:00:56,015 --> 00:00:58,840
this circle appears in the left margin.

18
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:02,842
Let's close the assistant editor and
focus on the Storyboard for a minute.

19
00:01:02,842 --> 00:01:07,500
Inside Storyboard, new controllers
are represented by yellow circle icons,

20
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,540
like this one in the outline view,
and this one in the canvas view.

21
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:16,020
The outline view is an expandable tree
that shows the view controller the view

22
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:17,340
and any subviews.

23
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:20,320
The canvas view is just another
representation of the exact

24
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,030
same objects.

25
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:25,220
If we control click on one of
the view controller icons,

26
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:27,400
we see the pop up connections menu.

27
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:30,140
And here we can see our label property.

28
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:32,910
You can see here that this
circle representing our label

29
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:34,470
property is empty.

30
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:36,460
That's because it hasn't
been initialized yet.

31
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:38,550
So let's go ahead and do that now.

32
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:42,281
To initialize our label,
first we open up the utilities pane and

33
00:01:42,281 --> 00:01:44,270
drag in a label from the objects menu.

34
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:50,440
Let's close this utilities pane, and
then we can set our label property

35
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:54,030
by dragging from new referencing
outlet to the canvas view.

36
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:58,120
Here in the pop up connections menu we
can see that our label property is set.

37
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:02,840
If I control click here in the canvas
view I can also see that the label

38
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,240
property is set.

39
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:08,090
If I want to unset it I
just click on this small x.

40
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:11,100
I want to show you one more
way you can set that property.

41
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:15,190
So let's open up the assistant editor
and see that you can drag from

42
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:18,650
the circle in the left margin
here straight to the canvas view.

43
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:23,250
And then let's check again in
our pop up connections menu and

44
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:24,820
see that our label property is set.
