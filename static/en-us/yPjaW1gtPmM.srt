1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:01,708
For our next step,

2
00:00:01,708 --> 00:00:05,658
we need to authenticate by logging into
the movie database, but this time we're

3
00:00:05,658 --> 00:00:09,165
going to use a different offload that
goes to the movie database website.

4
00:00:09,165 --> 00:00:11,812
Let's go back to Travis for
a little bit of context.

5
00:00:11,812 --> 00:00:13,437
Travis can you explain this,

6
00:00:13,437 --> 00:00:17,598
how we use this flow when we log into
the website to authenticate, and why did

7
00:00:17,598 --> 00:00:21,660
you go with this approach instead of
using something popular like OAuth?

8
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:22,315
>> Yeah, no, for sure.

9
00:00:22,315 --> 00:00:25,914
So back when I did the first
pass of authentication

10
00:00:25,914 --> 00:00:28,356
OAuth was just a little bit of a mess.

11
00:00:28,356 --> 00:00:32,769
And, you know, [COUGH] instead of
trying to force this system that

12
00:00:32,769 --> 00:00:37,261
was just kind of broken onto our users',
I just had the tools or

13
00:00:37,261 --> 00:00:41,853
something that was really close
to OAuth, but ultimately our own.

14
00:00:41,853 --> 00:00:46,971
And, you know, you'll see as you go
through the principles of OAuth,

15
00:00:46,971 --> 00:00:50,394
and our off flow are almost identical.

16
00:00:50,394 --> 00:00:55,256
You do all the, you know, credential
checking on the website, so you're not

17
00:00:55,256 --> 00:01:01,228
passing usernames and passwords over
the air they're really almost identical.

18
00:01:01,228 --> 00:01:05,569
It's just that we, we just thought it
was a lot easier to do it ourselves.

19
00:01:05,569 --> 00:01:07,101
>> Thanks for filling us in, Travis.

20
00:01:07,101 --> 00:01:10,111
Rolling your own solutions definitely
sometimes the best way to get

21
00:01:10,111 --> 00:01:11,652
the functionality that you want.

22
00:01:11,652 --> 00:01:12,741
And before we move ahead,

23
00:01:12,741 --> 00:01:15,620
let's take a look at those principles
that Travis was referring to.
