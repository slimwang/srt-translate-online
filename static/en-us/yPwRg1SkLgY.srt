00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:00,660
Okay.

2
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:02,640
So now let's tackle
objective three together.

3
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:04,600
This objective really has three parts.

4
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:07,310
First we need to create a link
to make a new restaurant.

5
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:10,860
Then create a page to handle the get
request when we click on that link.

6
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:14,830
And finally, a get post method to
persist the data to the database.

7
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:17,210
Well the first part
doesn't seem too hard.

8
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:20,500
Let's add another anchor tag to our
restaurants page that prompts the user

9
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,330
to create a new restaurant,
followed by a few break lines.

10
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:24,080
We can go ahead and

11
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:28,900
fill out this href to /restaurants/new
as stated in the objective.

12
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:32,340
Next, I will create another page to
handle this new restaurant request.

13
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:35,950
Inside my do_GET block, I will add
another if statement that looks for

14
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:38,820
the /restaurants/new URL.

15
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:39,980
Looking at this code,

16
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:43,660
we can see a lot of similarities with
our previous do_GET if statements.

17
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:47,580
I have added here a field where the user
can input the name of a new restaurant.

18
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:48,980
So now that the layout is in place,

19
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:51,580
the magic really happens
with our post request.

20
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:54,490
Unlike get requests,
post requests cannot be executed by

21
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:57,250
simply typing a URL in the browser and
hitting enter.

22
00:00:57,250 --> 00:01:01,840
However, do_POST is going to look for
the /restaurants /newpath,

23
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,586
passed along from my forum,
in order to know what action to perform.

24
00:01:04,586 --> 00:01:06,470
Inside my do_POST,

25
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:09,890
I will comment out the previous
code inside the try block for now.

26
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:13,860
I then add an if statement,
looking for /restaurants/new.

27
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:17,290
Then I extract the information from
the form similarly to the way I

28
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:19,370
did it in the first web server we wrote.

29
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:22,340
But this time I incorporate that
data into my declaration of

30
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:23,760
a new restaurant class.

31
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:24,950
Also differently now,

32
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:28,130
instead of printing my results to
the current webpage, I create a redirect

33
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:31,460
here that will take me back to my
original restaurant's homepage.

34
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:33,610
Let's save and restart our server again.

35
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:35,340
If we can create a new restaurant, and

36
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:38,650
see it added to our page,
objective three is over and out.

37
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:41,580
The source code for objective three
is available in the instructor notes.
