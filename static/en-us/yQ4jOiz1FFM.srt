You know what I'm a big fan of? Atom-atons, you know, self-thinking robots

2
00:00:03,159 --> 00:00:06,519
running around doing chores and all that stuff. Of course, if they have the

3
00:00:06,519 --> 00:00:08,776
ability to think for themselves, they're probably going to get into some

4
00:00:08,776 --> 00:00:12,444
trouble? Nah, we'll worry about that later. Anyhow, entities are a fantastic

5
00:00:12,444 --> 00:00:15,612
concept, attaching logic to units is the backbone about how your simulation is

6
00:00:15,612 --> 00:00:20,336
going to exist. Now, don't get too far down the rabbit hole here, entities

7
00:00:20,336 --> 00:00:24,590
bridge the line between design and code. So, at every step of the way, when you

8
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:27,406
add features, you're going to have to negotiate between how much of the control

9
00:00:27,406 --> 00:00:31,634
is on the designer side and on the programmer side. So, make sure when you're

10
00:00:31,634 --> 00:00:34,230
designing your framework, keep both parties involved.
