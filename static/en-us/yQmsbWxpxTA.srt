00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:05,180
The first thing that happens when
we create a new notebook is that

2
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:11,100
the context realizes something has
changed in the objects within it namely,

3
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:12,780
there's a new object.

4
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:19,968
The context therefore sends the
NSManagedObjectContextObjectsDidChangeN-

5
00:00:19,968 --> 00:00:23,960
otification with a new
object as a payload.

6
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:27,980
And as FetchedResultsController
receives the notification and

7
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:33,180
sends a delegate message to
CoreDataTableViewController,

8
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:37,730
which in turn tells
the TableView to update.

9
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:38,890
So, there's no magic.

10
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:43,150
It's just the MVC, delegate, and
notifications doing their job.

11
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:44,830
Make sure you understand this, and

12
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:49,750
then if you haven't already, add a
similar button to the node's controller.

13
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:51,300
It's exactly the same thing.
