00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:05,700
Acute limitation of Anomaly Detection
is that it only uses normal or

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:07,780
legitimate data in training.

3
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:11,050
That is,
there's no intrusion data involved.

4
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:16,020
As a result, when an Anomaly Detection
model detects an anomaly,

5
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:17,820
it may not be limited to an intrusion.
