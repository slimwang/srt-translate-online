1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:05,330
Okay so now let us see how the AI
agent might go about building

2
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:09,120
an explanation that shows that
the object that have these properties

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,410
in fact is an instance of
this concept of a cup.

4
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:16,870
What I'll do here is to first sketch
out the explanation for you and

5
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:21,350
then I'll discuss how the AI agent
goes about building the explanation.

6
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:23,530
Let us first consider this part.

7
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:26,890
This is an abstraction that
we learn from the bowl.

8
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:30,245
The object carries liquid
because it is concave.

9
00:00:30,245 --> 00:00:33,450
There is a similar abstraction
learned from the briefcase.

10
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:38,700
The object is liftable because
it is light and it has a handle.

11
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:42,300
Here's the abstraction that the air
agent learned from the glass.

12
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:46,541
The glass enables drinking
because it carries liquids and

13
00:00:46,541 --> 00:00:48,390
because it is liftable.

14
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:52,730
So, in this way, the abstraction learned
from the glass gets connected to

15
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:54,560
the abstractions learned
from the bowl and

16
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:56,810
the abstraction learned
from the brief case.

17
00:00:56,810 --> 00:01:00,700
Note that the effect here and
the abstraction from the bowl has become

18
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:05,610
the cause for the effect that was
the abstraction from the glass.

19
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:09,940
Similarly here, the effected object is
liftable was learned from the briefcase

20
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:14,350
example, but in the context of
the glass, this becomes the cause for

21
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:16,290
object enables drinking.

22
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:18,660
Let's shift to the fourth example for
brick.

23
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:23,220
From there, one knows that the object
is stable because it is a bottom and

24
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:23,910
the bottom is flat.

25
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,830
Now, we can connect this causal
chain and this causal chain

26
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:33,480
into a more complex causal explanation
for why this object is a cup.

27
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:35,490
The call that we had said earlier and

28
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:40,160
the definition of a cup, that an object
is a cup if, it is stable and

29
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:44,170
it enables drinking,
now we have shown that in fact,

30
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:47,882
this particular object is a cup because
it is stable and it enables drinking.

31
00:01:47,882 --> 00:01:52,925
In practice when an A Agent actually
goes about building this explanation,

32
00:01:52,925 --> 00:01:54,505
it works backwards.

33
00:01:54,505 --> 00:01:58,885
For the definition of the cup, it knows
that in order for an object to be a cup,

34
00:01:58,885 --> 00:02:02,155
the object must be stable and
the object must enable drinking.

35
00:02:02,155 --> 00:02:05,206
So the A Agent's senses' goal
of proving that the object is

36
00:02:05,206 --> 00:02:07,415
stable into his memory.

37
00:02:07,415 --> 00:02:11,470
Memory returns the example of a brick,
because a brick is stable, but the brick

38
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:16,600
said that the brick is stable because
it has a bottom and the bottom is flat.

39
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:20,830
So the air agent affects this causal
relationship from the brick example and

40
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:22,920
applies it to the object here.

41
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,390
Similarly for this part and
they asked for

42
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:28,190
the definition of the cup was
that it enables drinking.

43
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:31,330
So how can the A agent prove that
the object enables drinking?

44
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:33,580
This object only exists in the kitchen.

45
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:37,580
The air agent sensed the goal of proving
that the object enables drinking

46
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:39,030
induced memory.

47
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:42,950
Memory returns the example for glass
because the glass enables drinking.

48
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:47,180
It abstracts from glass the fact that
the object must carry a liquid and

49
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:50,760
the object must be liftable
in order to enable drinking.

50
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:53,280
That sets up some new
experiences with sub goals.

51
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,780
How can the area agent now prove
that the object can carry liquid?

52
00:02:56,780 --> 00:03:01,140
That goes back into the memory, and
the example of a bowl is found.

53
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:04,500
And I think you can now see how the rest
of the explanation process would work.

54
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,195
Note this connects with a couple of
lessons we have learned earlier.

55
00:03:08,395 --> 00:03:09,408
First you can see [INAUDIBLE]
reduction and application here.

56
00:03:09,408 --> 00:03:11,275
Wanting to prove that object is a cup,

57
00:03:11,275 --> 00:03:16,925
to do that we deduce the problem into
two smaller and simpler problems.

58
00:03:16,925 --> 00:03:20,815
Let's prove that object is stable, let's
prove that object enables drinking, and

59
00:03:20,815 --> 00:03:22,280
so on and so forth.

60
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,620
Second this connects with
the notion of planning.

61
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:28,200
When we were discussing planning
we had open preconditions.

62
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,900
Those were preconditions of a goal
which we needed to satisfy.

63
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:35,345
We use those open preconditions
to select operators,

64
00:03:35,345 --> 00:03:37,475
a similar thing is happening here.

65
00:03:37,475 --> 00:03:40,195
When we want to prove that
the object is a cup, then we have

66
00:03:40,195 --> 00:03:44,335
two open preconditions, object is
stable, and object enables drinking.

67
00:03:44,335 --> 00:03:49,015
These preconditions then become levels
while selecting explanatory proofs,

68
00:03:49,015 --> 00:03:53,260
explanatory fragments that can
help fulfill those preconditions.

69
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:56,250
>> So the scenario of a robot
proving that an object is a cup is

70
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:57,920
a bit of a longer term scenario.

71
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,790
We're still a ways away from having
robots that walk around our house and

72
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:02,520
retrieve cups for us.

73
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:05,910
To take an example perhaps from
the near future, I can imagine one day

74
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:09,610
having a word processor that has built
into it some intelligence such that,

75
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:12,710
instead of choosing a file based
strictly on its file name,

76
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:16,860
I can say something like, get me that
important document from last Tuesday.

77
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:19,399
I myself might not remember
the filename or where I saved it, but

78
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:22,610
I remember that last Tuesday I was
working on an important document.

79
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:24,530
The intelligent search in
the word processor would

80
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:25,930
then iterate over the documents and say,

81
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:29,840
can I both prove that the document is
important and it is from last Tuesday?

82
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:34,110
Now the word processor might not have
a notion of importance built into it

83
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:38,170
naturally, but it knows documents I
considered important in the past.

84
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:41,020
And it might start to notice the
documents that have my header on them,

85
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:43,570
and have my signature at the bottom,
are important.

86
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:45,240
And from there,
it can start to build a case for

87
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,610
why that particular
document is important.

88
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:49,510
Coupled with just being able
to read the time stamp and

89
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:51,980
see if it's from last Tuesday,
it should be able to retrieve for

90
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:55,150
me documents that might be both
important and from last Tuesday without

91
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:59,260
me ever really knowing what the document
file name was or where I saved it.

92
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:02,300
>> This kind of explanation-based
learning actually occurs in our

93
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:03,610
everyday life.

94
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:06,350
So you are now constantly improvising.

95
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:07,870
Papers are blowing off my desk.

96
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:09,670
How can I stop them from blowing off?

97
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:11,500
So I need something to stop
them from blowing away.

98
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,680
What is other label what
can act as a paper weight?

99
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,270
A cup.

100
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:14,980
Here is a cup.

101
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:16,346
Let me put it on the paper.

102
00:05:16,346 --> 00:05:19,800
This is an example of improvisation
where we use explanation-based learning

103
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:25,270
to realize that this is how we use
a flat bottom can act as a paper weight.

104
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:26,610
Here is another example.

105
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:29,610
I need to prop open a door,
a door stopper is not available.

106
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:30,700
What can I use?

107
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:32,320
Perhaps an eraser or a chair.

108
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:39,090
You and I do this kind of improvisation
all the time, and often we are building

109
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:43,060
these explanations that tell us that
an eraser can be used as a door stopper.
