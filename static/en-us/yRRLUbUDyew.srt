1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:02,840
We're going to take
the example just mentioned and

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:05,600
illustrate how you can do this Alteryx.

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:09,490
We're going to count how many
customers fall within five miles

4
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:11,550
of each store location.

5
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:16,219
We start our workflow with two files,
a store location file.

6
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:20,880
It's in Alteryx native format
with the extension yxdb, and

7
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,680
the other file is a customer
file in CSV format.

8
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:28,760
Notice that the customer's
file has a latitude and

9
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:33,110
longitude field associated
with each of the customers.

10
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:37,390
We can use this data to create
spacial points for each customer,

11
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:41,790
making it possible to use this
data set for spacial matching.

12
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:43,560
Now let's go back to
the store locations.

13
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:51,450
Notice how this file has field called
spacial obj with a value point.

14
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:56,800
That means that the records already have
a point spacial object attached to them.

15
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:01,820
To confirm this, we can simply add
a browse tool and run the workflow.

16
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:05,580
When we do this,
we can see points on a map on the left.

17
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:09,792
We'll use cloud made maps
as the base map layers, so

18
00:01:09,792 --> 00:01:13,924
that we can view the map
with reference map layers.

19
00:01:13,924 --> 00:01:18,012
But if we add a browse tool
to the customer's file,

20
00:01:18,012 --> 00:01:21,158
we'll see only tabular data, no map.

21
00:01:21,158 --> 00:01:24,661
So we know that this file is
not spatially enabled yet.

22
00:01:24,661 --> 00:01:28,797
To spatially enable a file,
we go to the Spatial category, and

23
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:31,380
select the tool called Create Points.

24
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:35,300
Once connected,
we identify the longitude and

25
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:37,715
latitude fields in the customer file.

26
00:01:38,725 --> 00:01:40,205
By adding a browse tool and

27
00:01:40,205 --> 00:01:43,775
then running the work flow,
we'll see the customers on a map.

28
00:01:43,775 --> 00:01:45,425
Coming back to the stores,

29
00:01:45,425 --> 00:01:50,635
we wanted to find the trade area around
each store as a five-mile radius.

30
00:01:50,635 --> 00:01:54,285
To create this,
we add in the Trade Area tool.

31
00:01:54,285 --> 00:01:58,625
And we're going to specify the value
of the trade area to be 5 and

32
00:01:58,625 --> 00:02:01,690
the units to be radius in miles.

33
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:04,710
Let's bring in a browse tool so
we can see the radii.

34
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:09,830
Browse tools always have to be used when
we're looking at the actual map objects.

35
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:12,250
They're not required for
looking at tabular data.

36
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:17,720
We can see the trade areas here,
and if we look close,

37
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:23,030
we can see that there's overlap
between two of the trade areas.

38
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:28,430
This could actually be removed by
going back to the Trade Area tool and

39
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:31,940
selecting the option
to eliminate overlap.

40
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:37,670
When we run the work flow again, we can
see that the overlap is eliminated,

41
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:43,420
basically by drawing a straight line
on the edges where the two radii meet,

42
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:45,580
getting rid of the overlap.

43
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:48,140
Next, we'lll use a spacial match tool

44
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:52,100
to find the customers that fall
within the five mile radii
