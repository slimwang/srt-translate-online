1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The correct answer is the third choice.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
What the client needs to do to know that it's talking with the correct server--

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
it needs to know that it's talking with server S and knows that that's a public key owned by S.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
If that's correct, then S owns the corresponding private key

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
and only that server can decrypt this message and obtain the right session key.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
This is the problem the certificate is designed to solve.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Number one would work if we had a way to always know the public key beforehand.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
That would be great. We wouldn't need any other solution.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
This is not going to work for websites.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
This would only work if we could pre-load the public key

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
of all the websites we might ever communicate with into the browser.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
That's not realistic.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
We need some other way of getting new public keys for new sites as we visit them.

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Verifying the certificate using KUS doesn't make any sense,

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
because KUS was provided by the server, so if we use the server's public key

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
to verify the certificate, that would be a self-signed certificate.

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
It wouldn't prove anything since the signature is being verified

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
with the key provided by the person claiming the signature.

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
That's why we need the third solution, which uses some other key

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
that the client already trusts to verify the certificate and then the information

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
in the certificate to know that it's the right server and to know the server's public key.
