00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:04,580
For the next few quizzes, I'll ask
questions that are all related to

2
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:06,950
the consistency models
we just looked at.

3
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:09,390
For each quiz I will
show you a timeline, and

4
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:13,870
I will ask you whether if that
particular execution is consistent

5
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:16,810
according to some consistency model or
not.

6
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:18,270
Here is the first quiz.

7
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:21,310
Consider the following
sequence of operations.

8
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:24,160
I'm showing two processes P1 and P2 and

9
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,850
according to some real time they're
performing certain operations.

10
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:31,130
The question to you is is
this particular execution of

11
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:34,600
these two processes
sequentially consistent?

12
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,600
The possible answers are yes or no.
