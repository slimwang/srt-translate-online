Okay. Now what would happen to the dog's response if we repeatedly presented

2
00:00:04,865 --> 00:00:10,974
the tone and never followed it with meat powder? It would salivate more. It

3
00:00:10,974 --> 00:00:16,040
would salivate less. It would bark. Or, it would stop salivating. So check as

4
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:20,574
many or as few of the responses that you think are correct. If you're not sure,

5
00:00:20,574 --> 00:00:23,740
that's okay. Just think carefully about the question and give it a try.
