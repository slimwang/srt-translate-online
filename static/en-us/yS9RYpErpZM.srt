1
00:00:00,041 --> 00:00:03,981
So in a moment,
we'll address how you estimate the value

2
00:00:03,981 --> 00:00:07,191
of that company that
generates $1 per year.

3
00:00:07,191 --> 00:00:09,466
In other words,
that dollar bill machine.

4
00:00:09,466 --> 00:00:11,156
Before we dig into that,

5
00:00:11,156 --> 00:00:17,130
lets spend a moment considering why does
it matter how much a company is worth?

6
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:21,777
This course is about buying and selling
stocks, so we're going to look at why

7
00:00:21,777 --> 00:00:25,856
company value matters with regard
to buying and selling stocks.

8
00:00:25,856 --> 00:00:30,607
Of course, we want to buy a stock
when the price is too low and

9
00:00:30,607 --> 00:00:33,661
we want to sell it when it's too high.

10
00:00:33,661 --> 00:00:39,331
In general, the value of
a company goes up monotonically.

11
00:00:39,331 --> 00:00:43,120
In other words,
it is always increasing over time.

12
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:48,480
Let's assume for a moment,
this is the true value of that company.

13
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:53,247
We'll address in a little bit what true
means, but let's assume for the moment

14
00:00:53,247 --> 00:00:57,964
that we have some understanding of the
underlying real value of that company.

15
00:00:57,964 --> 00:01:00,748
Now that true value is distinct and

16
00:01:00,748 --> 00:01:04,879
different from the value
estimated by the market.

17
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,719
In other words, what price
the stock market says, it's worth?

18
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:13,637
So on one particular day, maybe
the price is higher than the true value.

19
00:01:13,637 --> 00:01:19,180
On some other day, maybe it's lower and
on some other day, it's the same.

20
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:24,360
Very many trading strategies,
which is what this course is about,

21
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:28,630
focus on identifying
situations where the current

22
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:33,430
stock price is different
from the true value.

23
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:36,773
So in other words,
if the stock price goes up a lot, but

24
00:01:36,773 --> 00:01:40,348
we know the actual company is
only worth a certain amount.

25
00:01:40,348 --> 00:01:44,136
When it goes up high,
that might be a selling opportunity.

26
00:01:44,136 --> 00:01:46,435
In other words,
if we see the price up here and

27
00:01:46,435 --> 00:01:50,280
we know the true value of
the company is down here, sell it.

28
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:54,780
And similarly, if we see the price
really low compared to what the company

29
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:57,610
is worth, that could represent
a buying opportunity.

30
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:04,530
There are many, many ways that we can
estimate the true value of a company.

31
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:07,236
We're going to touch on a few
of them in this lesson.

32
00:02:07,236 --> 00:02:11,992
One is intrinsic value,
this is based on the value of

33
00:02:11,992 --> 00:02:16,325
the company as estimated
by future dividends.

34
00:02:16,325 --> 00:02:21,562
In other words,
companies pay many companies not all,

35
00:02:21,562 --> 00:02:25,470
pay each year or
each quarter a dividend.

36
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:28,070
So it's a cash payment,
if you own a share of stock,

37
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:30,470
you get a certain amount of dividend.

38
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:34,880
For instance, for Apple this year,
it's about $2 per year.

39
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:41,130
So intrinsic value is based on,
if we own one share of stock, we're

40
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:47,020
going to get some amount of dividends
accumulated over all of the future.

41
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:50,094
What's the value of
the company based on that?

42
00:02:50,094 --> 00:02:55,078
Another is book value, which is based
on the assets that the company owns.

43
00:02:55,078 --> 00:02:56,445
So in other words,

44
00:02:56,445 --> 00:03:00,895
we add up the value of all
the factories that they own and so on.

45
00:03:00,895 --> 00:03:02,393
Finally is market cap.

46
00:03:02,393 --> 00:03:06,205
This is based on the value of
the stock on the market and

47
00:03:06,205 --> 00:03:09,250
how many shares are outstanding.

48
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:10,610
So in other words,

49
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:15,038
this relates to what is the market
think the company is worth?

50
00:03:15,038 --> 00:03:19,511
This relates to what's the value
of the sum of the assets?

51
00:03:19,511 --> 00:03:22,979
And this one relates to, well,
if I own a share of stock,

52
00:03:22,979 --> 00:03:25,744
how much money am I going to
get over the future?

53
00:03:25,744 --> 00:03:29,160
And what's that worth overall
in the future going forward?
