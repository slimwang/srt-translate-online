1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,325
This is a conditional equation. If we were to replace c with 1 for example, then

2
00:00:05,337 --> 00:00:10,625
our equation would say 598 equals 92 times 1. We could simplify that to say that

3
00:00:10,637 --> 00:00:15,700
598 equals 92, but we know that that's not true, 598 is not equal to 92. That

4
00:00:15,712 --> 00:00:20,950
means that there are some values of c for which this equation is not true, so we

5
00:00:20,962 --> 00:00:23,968
know already that this is not an identity.

6
00:00:23,972 --> 00:00:27,685
I'll tell you right now, though, that this last choice, that this is not an

7
00:00:27,697 --> 00:00:31,655
equation, is incorrect. There is, in fact, one value for which this equation is

8
00:00:31,667 --> 00:00:34,290
true. Our next step is going to be to find that value.
