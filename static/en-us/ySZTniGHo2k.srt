00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,337
So let's see if we can put
this to work in a quiz.

2
00:00:03,337 --> 00:00:06,193
Consider a cache with
a 32 byte block size and

3
00:00:06,193 --> 00:00:09,204
a processor that creates
16-bit addresses.

4
00:00:09,204 --> 00:00:14,280
If the address in binary is this,
there are 16-bits here, so if that

5
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:20,390
is the address, what is the block number
that corresponds to this address?

6
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:24,190
And what is the block offset that
corresponds to this address?

7
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:27,487
You can put binary numbers here
because it's a lot easier that way.
