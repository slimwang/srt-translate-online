1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:02,540
Alright so now that we have a sense of what tit for

2
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:06,180
tat does against various strategies, lets try to think about what we

3
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:08,350
should do against tit for tat, so what do we do if

4
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:11,300
we're facing tit for tat. So I'm just going to break it down

5
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:14,690
to two possibilities it turns out there's actually more, but these these

6
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:18,830
two are pretty instructive. So lets pretend that we have to choose

7
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:22,480
between always defect as a way of playing against tit for tat,

8
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,140
or we have to be always cooperate playing against tit for tat.

9
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:30,690
So what I've written down here is what the total discounted reward is going to

10
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:35,850
be or the total reward in this case. As a function of gamma. So, lets

11
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:37,300
start with what happens if you play

12
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:39,780
always cooperating against tit for tat. Well, you

13
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:42,440
already told me that it. Such a thing

14
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:44,860
will result in tit for tat always cooperating.

15
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:45,260
>> Mm Hm.

16
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:47,570
>> And that means we're going to play in

17
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:51,320
this box. The cooperate-cooperate box. And that means on

18
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,750
every single round, we're going to to get

19
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:54,986
a minus one. Which means over an infinite

20
00:00:54,986 --> 00:01:00,510
run we're going to get an average of one, sorry minus one over one minus Gamma.

21
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:01,730
>> Mm Hm. That makes sense.

22
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:02,510
>> Okay? You agree with that?

23
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:05,920
>> I do. Just minus one repeated over and over again.

24
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,960
Now always defect as you recall you told me that, that will

25
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:14,300
result, well for the always defect agent against tit for tat, the

26
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:16,530
first thing that is going to happen is it's going to defect

27
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:19,480
while the tit for tat cooperates right? So we're

28
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:22,160
going to get zero for playing that strategy on the

29
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:24,480
first round. Zero doesn't sound very good but look

30
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,620
at the alternatives. They're all negative so zero's pretty good.

31
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:27,810
>> Mm-hm.

32
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:29,610
>> So it does this sort of you know good thing in the

33
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:34,090
first step then after that tit for tat responds by always defecting in

34
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:37,840
response. Right? And that means we're going to be stuck in this box

35
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,960
the defect defect box where you get minus sixes for the rest of ever.

36
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:41,890
>> Yes.

37
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:44,670
>> So that means minus six over one minus gamma. But that

38
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:47,220
starts one step from now so we multiply it by another gamma.

39
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:48,160
>> Okay.

40
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,880
>> Alright. So these are two different

41
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:52,220
expression that represents what our pay off

42
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:54,540
would be for adopting two different strategies.

43
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:56,900
And in fact, if gamma is really high,

44
00:01:56,900 --> 00:02:00,800
very close to 1, then this is a really good answer, right? Because it sort of

45
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:06,900
grows, it's like, minus over one minus gamma. So, for high gamma, we're talking

46
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:09,155
about something that's minus one times a really big number.

47
00:02:09,155 --> 00:02:10,100
>> Mm-hm.

48
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:12,360
>> Whereas this first one is not so good

49
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,900
for high gamma because what's going to happen is it's

50
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:16,790
going to get, end up getting minus six on every

51
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:19,310
step. So it's going to do worse overall. But if, if

52
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:21,660
we're talking about the low gamma. Then, let's say,

53
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:24,836
you know, zero for example. A gamma of zero will,

54
00:02:24,836 --> 00:02:27,610
will always defect. We'll get zero plus zero. But

55
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:31,911
always cooperate, we'll get negative one over one. And zero

56
00:02:31,911 --> 00:02:34,760
is better than minus one. So for really small

57
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:37,650
gamma, like if the games unlikely to last many

58
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:40,360
rounds, you should defect. But is the game is

59
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,270
going to last a long time, then you should cooperate.

60
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:43,520
>> I believe that.

61
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:47,700
>> Cool! Alright, so then my question to you is: What's the value of gamma

62
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:50,010
for which these two different strategies to

63
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:51,900
play against tit for tat are equally good.

64
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,580
>> I think I know the answer.

65
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:56,940
>> Woah! That was fast. Let's give everybody else

66
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:57,740
a chance to think about it.

67
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:58,270
>> Okay.

68
00:02:58,270 --> 00:02:59,500
>> Go.
