00:00:00,174 --> 00:00:04,243
In this exercise, we've taken out the
random kicks the ball is receiving, so

2
00:00:04,243 --> 00:00:08,320
that you can make the ball move
around in response to the arrow keys.

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,889
We've added two new constants,
acceleration and max speed.

4
00:00:12,889 --> 00:00:16,461
If, say, the left arrow key is pressed,
what we want to do is subtract from

5
00:00:16,461 --> 00:00:20,064
the velocity in the x-direction
the acceleration times the frame delta.

6
00:00:20,064 --> 00:00:23,545
If the right arrow key is pressed,
we want to add the acceleration times

7
00:00:23,545 --> 00:00:26,808
the frame delta to the x velocity,
similarly with the y velocity.

8
00:00:26,808 --> 00:00:31,703
When we're done changing the philosophy,
we also want to cap how

9
00:00:31,703 --> 00:00:36,687
fast the ball is going with a call
to the clamp method on vector two.

10
00:00:36,687 --> 00:00:39,630
While there's no physically
inspired reason to do this,

11
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:43,421
and the drag in the system does a good
job of slowing the ball down, anyway.

12
00:00:43,421 --> 00:00:47,207
Allowing arbitrarily high velocities
in your game often sets you up for

13
00:00:47,207 --> 00:00:49,855
some very strange behavior
down the road, like,

14
00:00:49,855 --> 00:00:52,270
things teleporting through walls and
so on.

15
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,940
All right, time for
you to add arrow key movement to a game.

16
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:59,406
As usual,
the real story's in the course code.

17
00:00:59,406 --> 00:01:01,259
