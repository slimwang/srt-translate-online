1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:03,680
As we mentioned earlier,
Stage 2 is similar to Stage 1,

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:08,810
but raises the bar both
qualitatively and quantitatively.

3
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:11,410
It also introduces some
striking requirements,

4
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:15,070
with respect to patients
participation in their care.

5
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:19,530
Here we see the bar going up
from 40% E-Prescribing to 50%.

6
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:21,940
And the qualitative

7
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:26,890
addition that prescriptions be compared
to at least one drug formulary.

8
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:30,000
A list of medications usually
reviewed by experts, and

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,510
felt to be cost effective treatments for
their target condition.
