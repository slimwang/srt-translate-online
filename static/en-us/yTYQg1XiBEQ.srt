1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
[Thrun] And the answer is no.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:08,000
To see, let's look at the slope of the linear function if it existed.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
From 0 to 1 we increment Y by 3.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
We go from 3 to 6.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Therefore, the slope of it must be 3.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
However, from 1 to 2 we only increase the function by 1, from 6 to 7.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Therefore, it can't be fit linearly.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
We can see the same if we plot the linear points.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Over here we could fit a linear function, but it's very shallow,

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
whereas those points over here have a much steeper situation.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So any linear function would probably miss these points in between.
