00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Obviously, direct--that would be a direct sales force--number 4.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Ancillary would be number 2--referred revenue.

00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
An example of an asset revenue stream would be number 6--sale of ownership.

00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Usage would be proportional users--number 7.

00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:24,314
And subscriptions would certainly be number 5 but also could be number 1.
