1
00:00:00,775 --> 00:00:04,070
Phew, now we've downloaded
the container, we can go ahead and

2
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:07,030
actually do something in
our app that uses it.

3
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:09,470
We can get things out and
use them where we want.

4
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:13,340
It's a simple matter of knowing
the key and retrieving the value.

5
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:15,840
First Get the ContainerHolder.

6
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:18,360
Then retrieve the value by key.

7
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:21,630
Obviously, you have to
know the exact key.

8
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:25,560
Here's how we get the daily
special: we just call getString and

9
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,690
pass the key daily-special.

10
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:29,280
And that's all there is too it.

11
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:33,350
Whenever the daily special updates, your
app will automatically get the latest

12
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:36,540
value without you having to
make any changes to the code.

13
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:41,320
Note, though, that the update only
takes effect when the app is restarted,

14
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:47,255
because the code to get the container
is in the onCreate method.

15
00:00:47,255 --> 00:00:52,005
To try it out, update your app to
show the latest daily special.

16
00:00:52,005 --> 00:00:57,420
In the ShowDailySpecial activity,
define the method Update daily special

17
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:00,330
that get's the daily special
out of the container and

18
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:04,739
updates the relevant text view so
that your users can actually see it.

19
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:07,430
And make sure that you actually
call update daily special

20
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:08,900
in the on create method.

21
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:11,730
Run the app and show the daily special.

22
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:16,400
And then In the Tag Manager dashboard,
go ahead and change the daily special.

23
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,860
Don't forget to publish your changes,
and

24
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:23,950
then restart your app and
see if you get the new value.

25
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:26,570
And hopefully the daily
special will have changed.

26
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:28,460
And go ahead and
check all the boxes when you're done.
