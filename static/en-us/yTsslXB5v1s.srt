1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,910
We're going to use
the mean shift algorithm

2
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:05,310
to find the modes within
that distribution.

3
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:08,290
By the way, the slides I'm going to
show you, I've showed you before, and

4
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:11,380
again these are all over the internet.

5
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:13,128
It says originally from Ukraine.

6
00:00:13,128 --> 00:00:15,680
It's in Sarel, and if that's who did it,
and I thank you for

7
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:18,180
doing these animations,
because everybody uses them.

8
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:21,250
So the idea of mean
shift is the following.

9
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:24,970
Here, I have the distribution
of points in some future space.

10
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:27,970
I plop down some region of interest.

11
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:30,770
And that region is
drawn here as a circle,

12
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:33,900
but think of it as a Gaussian blob,
right?

13
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:37,255
So, it actually is more weighted in
the middle, than it is to the outside.

14
00:00:37,255 --> 00:00:41,590
Mean-shift tends to work a little bit
better if you have a center waiting.

15
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:44,530
The reason for that is,
if I've got a hard circle on the end,

16
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:48,700
then if I move it a little bit, I might
run into a bunch of new points, and

17
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:51,060
it'll change my value quickly.

18
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:55,035
And I'd like to things to always be
smooth when I move things around, so

19
00:00:55,035 --> 00:00:56,575
by having a fall-off in the galaxy,

20
00:00:56,575 --> 00:01:00,090
and, as I get there sl,
as I get there, those points have a,

21
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:03,105
a little bit of influence, and
then they gain more influence.

22
00:01:03,105 --> 00:01:06,035
So what happens is I put down
this region of interest.

23
00:01:06,035 --> 00:01:09,785
I compute the center of mass,
that's the weighted center of mass, and

24
00:01:09,785 --> 00:01:13,915
the difference between them,
that's called my mean shift vector, and

25
00:01:13,915 --> 00:01:15,215
I just shift my mean there.

26
00:01:15,215 --> 00:01:16,830
Isn't that a beautiful animation?

27
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:17,940
And what do I do?

28
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:18,890
I do it again.

29
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:21,610
I compute the weighted center of mass.

30
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:22,520
There it is.

31
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:24,705
New Mean Shift vector shift it.

32
00:01:24,705 --> 00:01:26,833
[SOUND] Marvelous.

33
00:01:26,833 --> 00:01:27,834
And what do I do?

34
00:01:27,834 --> 00:01:33,667
I do it one more time, and
I keep doing this until I've converged.

35
00:01:33,667 --> 00:01:37,701
And there are some interesting proofs
of convergence under some reasonable

36
00:01:37,701 --> 00:01:40,440
assumptions and,
that finds you this mode.
