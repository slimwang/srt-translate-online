00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
For this question, we have the same information that we had in the first problem.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Additionally, suppose Eve learns that Alice generated the key k

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
using a biased random number generator that outputs 0 with a 52% probability.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
What is the conditional probability now that m = 1

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
given that Eve intercepts the ciphertext 01?

6
00:00:21,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Submit your answer with four decimal places.
