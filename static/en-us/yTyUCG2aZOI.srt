1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,330
And, what, what about what happens when you call super and

2
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:04,490
you go outside like, to process a Python script?

3
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:09,150
So in terms of working set, is that, is that, do you, are you

4
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:12,710
consuming memory from within the virtual machine or are you running outside?

5
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:15,810
The reason I ask is if you wanted to have a, a large fan out like,

6
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:19,235
50 instances of a volt and they're all going to run a Python program.

7
00:00:19,235 --> 00:00:20,230
>> Mm-hm.

8
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:22,400
>> Unix will usually keep the program memory one copy, and

9
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,650
then and then the data is, is separate from the-

10
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:27,080
>> So, Python runs extremely friendly, but then stop?

11
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:29,630
>> Yeah. >> So, I mean a Debian is ee,

12
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:34,180
a Debian process on the [INAUDIBLE] occur in Java, all goes through the model of

13
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:37,684
the stoneworkers that it will be mentioned to you, right?

14
00:00:37,684 --> 00:00:41,100
On another hand, the Python Topologies worked differently.

15
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:46,850
They acquired and also, like, the Python processes what do

16
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:50,840
you call it, created separately hanging off from the JDM, some work.

17
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:55,760
So then, what, what the, some worker gets the data, and

18
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,930
the data is to the Python has a couple be, couple bases, and

19
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:03,890
goes into a Python process, and it comes back to GVM before it opts to DVM.

20
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:07,535
>> So, that is a very different [CROSSTALK].

21
00:01:07,535 --> 00:01:09,023
>> So, the child-child process, so

22
00:01:09,023 --> 00:01:11,980
there's, if there's 50 instances, there's 50 childs.

23
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:12,510
>> Yeah. So, it's, yes.

24
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:13,590
>> Processes, basically.
