1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
In our example, we observed heads twice.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
So now I want to ask you a really tricky question:

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
What's the probability of observing heads and heads

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
if you flip the same unbiased coin twice?

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
This means in each flip we assume the probability of heads is 0.5.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Please answer here.
