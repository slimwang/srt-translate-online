00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,015
Hopefully, here's how you found out what

2
00:00:02,015 --> 00:00:04,170
gundega's name means in English. You'd go

3
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:10,070
to the API's explorer and search or scroll to the translate API. You list the

4
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:16,170
translate API functions, and choose language.translations.list.

5
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:20,970
Enter the text to translate, which in this case is gundega and enter

6
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:25,330
the target language, in this case, en. Then you press

7
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:30,800
the Execute button. And here's the response from that execution. See the

8
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:36,410
request, but more importantly the response. We see that the translated text, is

9
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:42,300
buttercup. What a lovely name. And the detected source language is LV,

10
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:48,240
which is Latvia. Let me check if that's correct. Gundega, where are you from?

11
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:50,650
>> That is correct,

12
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:51,890
I am indeed from Latvia
