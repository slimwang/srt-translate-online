1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:03,221
>> Throughout this course, we've discussed human thought and behaviors processes

2
00:00:03,221 --> 00:00:07,686
that are driven by both nature and nurture. And this lesson on mental illness

3
00:00:07,686 --> 00:00:10,610
epitomizes the dynamic interplay between the two.

4
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:13,732
>> That's right. And as we said throughout the course, we are like little chemical

5
00:00:13,732 --> 00:00:17,695
factories, making chemicals that help us live successfully in our environment.

6
00:00:17,695 --> 00:00:21,127
But as you've seen from this lesson, sometimes there can be a tragic disconnect

7
00:00:21,127 --> 00:00:24,663
between our individual nature and nurture experience which can result in mental

8
00:00:24,663 --> 00:00:26,535
illness.

9
00:00:26,535 --> 00:00:29,308
>> Although this lesson is sobering, we really hope that it shows you to be

10
00:00:29,308 --> 00:00:33,310
thankful the times that you're experiencing positive mental health.

11
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:36,544
>> That's right, and remember that it's not unusual for us to experience highs and

12
00:00:36,544 --> 00:00:40,811
lows throughout our life, periods of anxiety or depression. But it's when we

13
00:00:40,811 --> 00:00:43,866
don't have these experiences that we should be fortunate and thankful for our

14
00:00:43,866 --> 00:00:45,615
good mental health.

15
00:00:45,615 --> 00:00:48,715
>> Now that you've completed this lesson, we hope that you're a more educated

16
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:52,015
person in the terms of mental health literacy and that any negative stereotype

17
00:00:52,015 --> 00:00:58,250
or stigma that you may have once had are now diminished or completely removed.

18
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:01,630
>> We as humans are unique and fascinating creatures and it's not uncommon for us

19
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:07,340
to experience difficulties in the sometimes challenging world. However, when

20
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:10,590
those difficulties manifest themselves through mental illness, that can be

21
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:15,497
challenging in and of itself. However, as we'll see in the next lesson, there

22
00:01:15,497 --> 00:01:18,995
are a variety of techniques that can help reduce the symptoms of mental illness

23
00:01:18,995 --> 00:01:25,040
such that people can live fulfilling, meaningful, adventurous, and proud lives.

24
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,685
There's absolutely no shame in mental illness. And in our next lesson, we're

25
00:01:28,685 --> 00:01:31,200
going to learn about the treatments for mental disorders.
