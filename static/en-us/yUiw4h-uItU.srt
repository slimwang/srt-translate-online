00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,320
If your code passes all the tests,
congratulations!

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:04,910
This has been a pretty major project.

3
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:08,039
You've mastered some serious
skills in data base programing.

4
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:10,390
If it's not quite there yet,
don't give up.

5
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:13,160
It's normal for projects to go through
a lot of revisions before they're

6
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:14,400
feature complete.

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,290
Chat with your fellow
students on the forums, or

8
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:18,990
consult with your coach on things
that might have you stuck.

9
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:19,980
When you're done,

10
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:22,540
take a moment to reflect on what
you've accomplished in this project.

11
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:24,650
Are there any aspects of the design or

12
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:27,170
implementation that
ended up surprising you?

13
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:29,430
Things that you looked up
in the documentation, or

14
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:31,260
things that you discovered?

15
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:34,500
If you like, write down a surprising
fact you've discovered here.
