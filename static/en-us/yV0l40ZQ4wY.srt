1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,564
Well, I notice that down here, I had 2/6 and 3/6. I add 2 plus 3 so I have 5.

2
00:00:05,682 --> 00:00:11,220
So, I added the numerators together. For the denominators, I didn't change them.

3
00:00:11,337 --> 00:00:15,279
I was simply counting up how many sixths I had. I have 1/6, 2/6, 3/6, and 5/6

4
00:00:15,974 --> 00:00:20,890
altogether. So, we do not change the denominator.
