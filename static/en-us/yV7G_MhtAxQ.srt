00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:03,469
Here is a slightly different nested loops question. How would you write nested

2
00:00:03,469 --> 00:00:06,350
loops that print out this pattern of square brackets, without the slashes at

3
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:10,345
the front? So you would print one pair of square brackets on the first row, two

4
00:00:10,345 --> 00:00:14,728
on the second row, three on the third row and so on. There are a lot of ways to

5
00:00:14,728 --> 00:00:19,980
do this that work, it's a little different from the last problem. In the clock

6
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:24,980
problem the number of columns was the same for each row, but here it varies.

7
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:27,930
When you fill in the code for this, make sure to use this variable for the

8
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:33,790
number of rows. This way we'll be able to change it, and this will work for any

9
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:36,343
number of rows.
