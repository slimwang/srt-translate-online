00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,090
Let's quickly check that you
remember the definition of power

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:05,810
as it relates to energy and time.

3
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:10,470
Consider two systems, A and B, each
one is characterized by its execution

4
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:14,740
time to do the same computation
as well as its execution energy.

5
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:20,900
Now, suppose A uses less energy than B,
but B takes less time than A.

6
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:23,900
If it helps,
let's visualize this relationship.

7
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:29,360
This is an energy time phase diagram,
and here's system A and here's system B.

8
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:33,940
Here's my question, which system
has lower average power, A or B?

9
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:38,150
If you think they have the same
average power then check them both.

10
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:41,110
Or if you think there's not enough
information to tell, then check neither.
