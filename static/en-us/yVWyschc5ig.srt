1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:04,054
The landscape of software development
has drastically changed over the last

2
00:00:04,054 --> 00:00:06,660
10, 20 years, and
will continue to do so.

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:09,290
I think the scariest phrase in
the English language is we've

4
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:10,320
always done it that way.

5
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:12,560
With advances in hardware and

6
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:15,950
software, the pace of innovation
has only accelerated.

7
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:18,520
Old methodologies
simply can't keep pace.

8
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:22,100
Instead of shipping one major version
every couple of years, software

9
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:26,140
companies are continuously updating
services that are offered online.

10
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:29,670
When was the last time you got
software delivered via CD?

11
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:31,400
People just expect new features and

12
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:35,640
fixes to happen quickly without
disruption to their daily lives.

13
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,390
Common roadblocks like getting
access to infrastructure have

14
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:40,340
pretty much been eliminated.

15
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:43,660
Virtualization has changed the game for
operational teams.

16
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:45,500
Now you can create
servers in minutes and

17
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:48,410
harness the full power of
those physical resources.

18
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:52,990
Development teams have more opportunity
to create templates, clone, snapshot,

19
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:55,490
roll back, and
destroy whole environments.

20
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:58,980
There's also online services like AWS or
Digital Ocean,

21
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,820
where you can go and test your code.

22
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:04,060
Today, people don't have a lot of
sympathy in our on demand society.

23
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:07,950
If your site doesn't work or your app is
buggy, people have multiple ways to let

24
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:10,680
you know, which leads to
tarnishing your brand's image.

25
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,790
This puts extreme pressure on
developers and operations but

26
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:16,570
also product managers and
business people.

27
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:18,820
How do you manage everything
at this new pace?

28
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:21,700
How do you change old habits and
organizational structures and

29
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:23,720
processes to adapt?

30
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:28,010
A development process with a long detail
design phase, and a planning phase, and

31
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:33,540
then another long implementation phase
is slow, inefficient and error-prone.

32
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:38,070
To top it off, organizational silos that
prevent communication leads to stale

33
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:42,280
information, misconceptions, and
further slows down the process.

34
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,920
What arose from the ashes
of past mistakes?

35
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,550
Agile development was born.

36
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:50,600
Constant feedback with an iterative
approach allows to find problems quickly

37
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,180
for both developers,
and operations teams.

38
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:56,490
But Agile covers just the first
part of the application life cycle,

39
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:57,810
which is development.

40
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:01,020
Another part of the puzzle comes from
using Agile and Lean approaches,

41
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:03,030
incorporating operations.

42
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:06,400
With people still working in
their Silos, bottlenecks remain.

43
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,530
Breaking down the silos,

44
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:10,080
allow collaboration through
all stages of the development.

45
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,930
And this brings us to
the definition of Devops.
