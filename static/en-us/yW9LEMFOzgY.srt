1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,430
These next three blocks of code are actually where a lot of

2
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:05,350
the magic happens with d3.

3
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:10,970
This first block binds our data to our SVG elements.

4
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:13,640
Now, this is one of the most confusing parts of d3,

5
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:16,090
for newcomers to the library.

6
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:19,480
We first access the SVG chart element.

7
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:23,270
Find every possible group tag that may be in there.

8
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:28,150
And the group tag can be thought of as analogous to the div tag in HTML.

9
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:31,160
It has no visual display, but serves to group and

10
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:34,310
organize content that may be contained within it.

11
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:39,100
We then bind data, passing in the data that our draw function receives,

12
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:43,425
to the .data function, which binds it to the groups.

13
00:00:43,425 --> 00:00:48,810
.enter actually returns a sub-selection of the call to .data,

14
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:54,320
which represents every datum that has not already been placed on the page.

15
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,170
In this case, in the first call to .data,

16
00:00:57,170 --> 00:01:01,932
there are no elements on the page which have bound data to them.

17
00:01:01,932 --> 00:01:07,122
So .enter actually contains one element for every point in our data.

18
00:01:07,122 --> 00:01:11,700
.append g instructs the browser that for

19
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:17,960
every point in the enter selection append a g element to the chart.

20
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:22,570
And then for each of those group elements we want to transform them according to

21
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:23,790
this function.

22
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:27,600
Now there's a lot going on there I want to unpack it a little bit, but

23
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:32,210
we'll get much more into the details of what's happening with .data and

24
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:34,690
.enter in later lessons, and

25
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:40,230
also learn about other types of selections that aren't necessarily .enter.

26
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:45,860
From a very high level, this code basically says, look into my SVG.

27
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:49,020
Find whatever g tags there are there.

28
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:53,760
If there are zero g tags, the selectAll will be an empty selection.

29
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:56,230
Attach data to our selection.

30
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:59,590
A .enter basically says, for every point that's in our

31
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:04,630
data which doesn't have a corresponding element in the initial selection.

32
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:05,590
In this case,

33
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:10,275
since our initial selection was empty, because there weren't any g-tags yet.

34
00:02:10,275 --> 00:02:16,055
.enter, again, contains one element for every point in our data.

35
00:02:16,055 --> 00:02:18,730
.append instructs D3 and

36
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:24,390
for every one of these new group elements, change the transform attribute.

37
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:30,440
Which is unique to SVG according to whatever gets returned from this function.

38
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:35,150
Again if that wasn't perfectly clear we'll get more into those details and

39
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:37,170
specifics in later lessons.

40
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:39,630
I just wanted to show you what it looks like and

41
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:41,930
how to create a data driven chart
