00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,240
Wow.
There was a lot to learn in this lesson.

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:06,090
Now that we've got an understanding
of modern application design,

3
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:08,410
including the micro
services design pattern,

4
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:12,270
we can see how Modern Apps are pushing
the limits of current automation tools.

5
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:15,130
Instead of being one large Binary,
now these applications

6
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:18,290
are composed of many parts which
are smaller, easier to write and deploy.

7
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,628
These smaller independent binaries have
led to on demand updates that can happen

8
00:00:22,628 --> 00:00:23,170
at any time.

9
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:26,550
This is led to a rethink
of the tooling and

10
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:30,000
underlying infrastructure we're
using to support these modern apps.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,020
These requirements have led to a new
set of automation tools like Docker and

12
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:34,370
Kubernetes.

13
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:37,570
Stay tuned for our next lesson where you
learn how to use the Docker image format

14
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:38,900
to containerize applications.
