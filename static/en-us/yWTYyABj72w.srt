1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:01,780
All right Charles, so
what have we learned?

2
00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:06,910
>> We have learned that unlike Texas,
you can mess with reward functions.

3
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:07,830
>> And what does that mean?

4
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:12,370
>> Well, it means that you can take the
rewards that you're given and you can

5
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:18,040
modify them to still get the same policy
but maybe to learn it more quickly.

6
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:20,740
You can shape them.

7
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:23,100
And thus shape the experiences
of your agent.

8
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,770
>> And I think we talked about three
different ways that we can do that.

9
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:26,650
Do you remember what they were?

10
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:28,250
>> I remember one of them,
potential functions.

11
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:29,590
>> Sure, that was the last one.

12
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:32,750
>> So, also you can just do a shift.

13
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:36,010
You can just add a constant, and
it doesn't matter what that constant is,

14
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:37,480
so long as it's a constant.

15
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:40,310
And you can scale them, so but

16
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:44,140
you want to scale positively, so
it does matter what that constant is.

17
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:46,410
>> Otherwise we can swap max and
min by accident.

18
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:47,330
>> RIght.
But

19
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:49,170
I think the difference
between the third one and

20
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:55,200
the first two is that the first two
sort of don't change anything at all.

21
00:00:55,200 --> 00:01:01,980
They're just a kind of simple
linear changing of the function.

22
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:06,920
But the potential functions are set
up to help you learn faster,

23
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:10,390
not just learn the same thing.

24
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:12,330
>> So have we learned anything else?

25
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:13,810
>> Well,
I think we learned something, or

26
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:18,580
at least we, there was a subtle thing
we should have learned, which is, well,

27
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:21,000
potential functions can
help speed things up.

28
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,650
But we got the potential functions by
just talking about shaping rewards,

29
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:29,790
by just trying to change them in a way
that captured the parts of the space

30
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:30,770
that were better than others.

31
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:32,830
This is kind of pre-potential functions.

32
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:35,500
So I would say we learned about
reward shaping in general, and

33
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:38,180
that we learned that you
can do it really wrong.

34
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:39,490
>> And what happens when it goes wrong?

35
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:40,140
>> Well when it goes wrong,

36
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:43,690
you end up in these kind of
sub-optimal positive feedback loops.

37
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:47,420
And, in fact, the answer to that was
potential functions and that keeps us

38
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:54,650
from getting into these loops because we
subtract off the things that we gained.

39
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:56,350
>> Sure, okay, I'll buy that.

40
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:57,240
>> Okay, so that's good.

41
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:00,310
So we learned about reward shaping and
all of its various forms and learned

42
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:03,770
that it can hurt you and that potential
functions are a way to avoid that.

43
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:05,560
And potential functions
are kind of magical.

44
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,630
>> They do some really clever things.

45
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:09,919
It's probably good if on
the homework we look at some ways

46
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,660
of building potential functions.

47
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:15,570
Which things tend to speed
up more than other things.

48
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:17,950
So some nice empirical questions there.

49
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:19,680
And we should probably dive into that.

50
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,060
>> Yeah, I like that because I think one
could walk away from this thinking well,

51
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:25,840
potential functions are just magical,
they work, and everything's okay.

52
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:30,830
Except clearly then there must be
better potential functions than others.

53
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:34,820
Must be some that have no real
impact on learning, well,

54
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:36,520
have no impact on the speed of learning.

55
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:39,010
In some sense, all we showed is that

56
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:42,390
potential functions don't prevent you
from finding the right answer, but

57
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:46,120
presumably, you can come up with a
potential function that actually hurts.

58
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,600
>> Yes.

59
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,370
Right.
It could

60
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:52,080
lengthen the amount of time
before good behavior is learned.

61
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,320
>> Right.
Okay, cool.

62
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,480
Luckily we have homework for that and

63
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,650
the students can figure
that out on their own.

64
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:57,520
That seems great.

65
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,240
>> [LAUGH] All right, cool.

66
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,990
Well thanks so much for
going through this with me.

67
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:02,380
>> No, no, no.
Thank you Michael.

68
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:03,860
I enjoyed every moment of it.
