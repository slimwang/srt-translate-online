00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,447
This is a quiz to get you started with Python.

2
00:00:03,447 --> 00:00:05,680
We define a function thatâ€™s called sine

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:10,337
underscore cosine and this function should

4
00:00:10,337 --> 00:00:15,084
create arrays called X sine underscore X,

5
00:00:15,084 --> 00:00:19,472
cosine underscore X and fill these arrays with

6
00:00:19,472 --> 00:00:23,474
values that allow us to eventually plot the

7
00:00:23,474 --> 00:00:26,743
sine and the cosine curve from X equals zero

8
00:00:26,743 --> 00:00:29,658
to X equals two pi, exactly two pi.

9
00:00:29,658 --> 00:00:34,085
Your task is to fill in the code in this loop that

10
00:00:34,085 --> 00:00:38,563
iterates over fifty points. Make sure that X

11
00:00:38,563 --> 00:00:43,138
ranges from zero to two pi exactly. Sine X is the

12
00:00:43,138 --> 00:00:45,506
corresponding sine value,

13
00:00:45,506 --> 00:00:47,765
cosine X is the corresponding cosine

14
00:00:47,765 --> 00:00:50,363
value and then the matplotlib

15
00:00:50,363 --> 00:00:54,363
package will take care of plotting the curves.
