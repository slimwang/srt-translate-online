1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:01,569
All right, so, you ready?

2
00:00:01,569 --> 00:00:03,300
This is actually a good quiz,
you know why?

3
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:06,930
Because the quiz is going
to make us do some work.

4
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:11,260
So that was fine, what I just showed
you for some converged cameras.

5
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:13,740
What about if the image
planes are parallel?

6
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,850
What happens?

7
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:18,870
A, well, that's a degenerate case.

8
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:20,360
And we're going to see
that in just a minute.

9
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:23,190
B, that's fine, it's no problem.

10
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:28,390
It just means that R is the identity
matrix and the math just works.

11
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:31,230
C, I have no idea.

12
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:33,880
Okay, that's usually a bad answer
to put on a final, just saying.
