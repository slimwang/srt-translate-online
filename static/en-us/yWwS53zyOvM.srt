00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:05,405
If we use each side as the input to an exponential function with e as the base.

2
00:00:05,405 --> 00:00:10,850
Then we have e to the lnx equals e to the 10. The left hand side, just

3
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:14,640
simplifies to x, because of that inverse property that we talked about. And the

4
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:18,830
right hand side, is just equal to e to the 10 still, since we haven't evaluated

5
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:19,810
this yet.
