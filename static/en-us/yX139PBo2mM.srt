1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:01,814
So what do you think?

2
00:00:01,814 --> 00:00:07,939
I think the answer is 6.125 times 10
to the -10th squared microns per bit.

3
00:00:07,939 --> 00:00:09,350
Start with the area.

4
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:11,450
Then divide by the capacity.

5
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:13,690
You'd end up with something like this,

6
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:17,980
area divided by the capacity in
bytes convert bytes to bits.

7
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:20,460
So what kind of
screwball number is that?

8
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:22,350
Let's zoom in on a bit.

9
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:26,200
Assuming this area is square, let's
take the square root of our answer.

10
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:29,740
That will be about a quarter
of an angstrom on a side.

11
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:32,270
Whoa, man, that is small.

12
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:34,340
It's basically the radius of an atom.

13
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:38,210
A single classical bit like this one,
as opposed to a quantum bit,

14
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:40,430
probably doesn't get any smaller.

15
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:43,870
And that in fact is the point of this
exercise, at some point you won't

16
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:48,150
be able to squeeze any more bits
into a given volume of space.

17
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:50,000
And at that point you
won't have any choice but

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,060
to think about locality
in order to run fast.
