1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,990
First off, keep their graphics as jpegs.

2
00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:06,610
These are raster images they're taking,
so keep them saved in a raster format.

3
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:08,390
For the second question,

4
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:11,750
considering your users
are accessing your site on mobile.

5
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:15,270
It's actually a good idea to
inline these images if you can.

6
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:18,820
Inlining reduces the number of
requests the browser has to make.

7
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:23,050
And requests are one of the major
contributors to laggy or

8
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:25,040
unperformed websites on mobile.

9
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:26,680
Requests add round trips.

10
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:31,040
And round trips are one of the biggest
factors for slow websites on mobile.

11
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:33,730
But, with that being
said in the next lesson,

12
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:37,620
you'll see how inlining images can
limit your responsive options.

13
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:41,570
So, in the end an external file
still might be the way to go.

14
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:42,340
Either answer is correct.
