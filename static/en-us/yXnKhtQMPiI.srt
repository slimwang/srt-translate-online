1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:01,140
We're glad you're back.

2
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:04,850
In the last lesson you practiced
building better inputs.

3
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:06,880
You practiced picking
the right input types.

4
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:08,430
You enabled autofill.

5
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:11,750
You added clickable labels and
you validated inputs.

6
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:15,420
>> Now it's time to take a step back
from perfecting individual input and

7
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:19,660
start thinking about designing
better forms made of many inputs.

8
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:22,200
This lesson is particularly
important for e-commerce,

9
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,950
where better forms means more sales.

10
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:27,950
>> Yeah, this is really,
really important.

11
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:31,510
And take a look at PayPal's
ridiculous rise in mobile payments.

12
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:34,660
I think it makes sense that this
lesson also focuses on creating great

13
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:35,980
mobile experiences.

14
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:37,240
>> Definitely.

15
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:40,600
Luckily, there are a few basic
principles everyone can follow

16
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,470
to build better forms on every platform.

17
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:46,670
And they also apply well
outside of e-commerce.

18
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:50,460
Your ultimate goal is to minimize
the amount of time your user spends

19
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:51,420
filling out forms.

20
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:55,810
>> In this lesson, you'll practice
techniques to make forms mentally

21
00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:57,800
easier for your users to handle.

22
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:58,630
And at the end of the lesson,

23
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:02,850
you'll be given two ugly,
nasty forms with low conversion rates.

24
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:06,570
It'll be your job to apply best
practices to improve the forms and

25
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:08,410
boost conversion rates.

26
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:09,200
>> Awesome.

27
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:09,750
Let's go.

28
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:10,530
>> Yeah, let's go.
