00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:05,260
The answer is five. Three for the location and two for the direction. You might

2
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:08,839
be tempted to answer six with three for the direction. If you think about how a

00:00:08,839 --> 00:00:09,312
[UNKNOWN]

4
00:00:09,312 --> 00:00:12,444
works the sensor can be given in altitude and a swivel angle to specify

5
00:00:12,444 --> 00:00:17,294
direction. Just two values. A third value would be needed for the distance in a

6
00:00:17,294 --> 00:00:22,170
given direction, but our eyes detect just radiance, not distance. It's an

7
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:25,280
interesting way to think of the universe. Just five numbers specify the

8
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:29,568
location and direction, and only need then is the radiance. Put together enough

9
00:00:29,568 --> 00:00:32,296
radiance readings for a given location and set of directions and you get an

10
00:00:32,296 --> 00:00:36,849
image. It's also informative to think how the radiance values change as you

11
00:00:36,849 --> 00:00:41,314
move around. For example, if our sensor is in deep outer space, moving even

12
00:00:41,314 --> 00:00:46,270
large distances will cause only small changes in the radiance values received.

13
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:49,483
Having insight into how a scene's light field changes can help us figure out

14
00:00:49,483 --> 00:00:53,360
how best we can compute and store these changes to simulate it
