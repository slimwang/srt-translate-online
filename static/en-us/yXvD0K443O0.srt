00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:03,380
Okay. Time to draw the square. But this time,

2
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:06,520
using the computer. So, I created a new Python

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:10,560
file and called it mindstorms.py. You could've called it

4
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:13,110
something else. And then, inside it, I created a

5
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:17,170
function called draw_square, which, for now, is empty. Now,

6
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:20,090
I know there is this module in Python called

7
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:23,600
turtle. This is the actual thing that moves around

8
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,020
and draws stuff on the computer. By the way,

9
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:27,900
I encourage you to find out why this thing

10
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:30,450
is called turtle and not a dog, or a cat.

11
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:35,230
One way to start to draw is by saying, turtle.Turtle.

12
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:39,070
Now, this syntax is a little weird and we will

13
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:41,510
understand it by the end of this video, but

14
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:44,400
it suffices to say that this is how we grab

15
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,870
out turtle. I will call it brad. Now, the first

16
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:51,110
thing we want to do is move brad forward. And we

17
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:54,040
can use the forward function for that. This function takes in

18
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:57,220
a number, which is the distance we want to move forward.

19
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:59,420
Now, I just want to run this code, and see if it's

20
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:03,150
even working. But, you know what, the one thing we forgot,

21
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:05,510
is that we still don't have a screen on which this

22
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:09,430
turtle, aka brad, is going to move around. In other words,

23
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:12,770
we need the red carpet equivalent in our program. I know

24
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:16,300
that is done by adding a window screen, and this window is

25
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:19,200
going to have a red background, and I want to be able to close

26
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,230
this window any time I click on it. Now, let's save and run this program.

27
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:28,270
[BLANK_AUDIO]

28
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:32,510
All right. It seems that we have a window with a red background. And a turtle

29
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:36,980
named brad, which has moved 100 steps forward. Okay, so I am back at the code,

30
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:41,770
and now I'm going to finish making the square. So, after brad has moved 100

31
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:46,890
steps forward, I want to turn it right, and I want to do so by 90 degrees. So, I

32
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:53,300
can say, brad.right 90, and because I want to

33
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:58,180
do these two steps right here, four times to draw a square, I'll just

34
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:01,940
copy paste them a few times. So, I'm going to copy these two lines

35
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,422
and I'm going to paste them. Second time,

36
00:02:06,422 --> 00:02:11,630
third time, fourth time Let me save and run,

37
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:18,150
alright, it seems like we have our first square.
