1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,937
The first expression would be 2 to the 4th n cubed. I moved the n from the

2
00:00:03,937 --> 00:00:07,950
denominator to the numerator since it has a negative exponent. For this

3
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:11,910
expression, I move the base of m to the denominator and the base of n to the

4
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:16,152
numerator. Here, these 2 bases come to the numerator. So aha, I know these two

5
00:00:16,152 --> 00:00:20,543
are equal. This one doesn't match these other expressions, so it's out. For the

6
00:00:20,543 --> 00:00:24,703
second one, the m and the n both move to the numerator with positive exponents,

7
00:00:24,703 --> 00:00:28,891
but the 2 stays in the denominator, because the exponent is a positive 1. This

8
00:00:28,891 --> 00:00:32,989
one would be out, too. For this last one, I have a negative sign in front of the

9
00:00:32,989 --> 00:00:37,209
2. This is not an exponent, so I just list the negative 2 in the denominator.

10
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:41,566
The n to the negative 3, however, moves up to the numerator because the exponent

11
00:00:41,566 --> 00:00:45,272
is negative. This doesn't match these, so it's out as well. For the last

12
00:00:45,272 --> 00:00:49,237
problem, the two moves up to the numerator because the exponent is negative as

13
00:00:49,237 --> 00:00:53,064
well as the m. This definitely matches the other expressions. So here are the

14
00:00:53,064 --> 00:00:56,995
three. This was a really tricky quiz, so don't worry if you didn't get it right

15
00:00:56,995 --> 00:01:01,611
on the first try. I really wanted you to focus on negative exponents, negative

16
00:01:01,611 --> 00:01:05,914
numbers, and negative exponents for numbers. We have to keep in mind these

17
00:01:05,914 --> 00:01:08,352
differences when working with problems.
