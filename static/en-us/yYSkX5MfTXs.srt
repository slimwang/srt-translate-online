00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,485
The slope of line A is negative. The slope of line B is 0, since it's

2
00:00:03,485 --> 00:00:07,651
horizontal. And the slope of line C is positive. This is pretty interesting. I

3
00:00:07,651 --> 00:00:11,746
think this gives us a different way of quantifying how the shape of our curve is

4
00:00:11,746 --> 00:00:15,723
symmetric. As we move from one side of our parabola across the vertex to the

5
00:00:15,723 --> 00:00:19,819
other side, the sign of the slopes of our tangent lines as we move from point to

6
00:00:19,819 --> 00:00:23,956
point to point, switches direction. This is going to be true of any parabola.

7
00:00:23,956 --> 00:00:28,054
Although, you can imagine that if this parabola flipped upside down, you might

8
00:00:28,054 --> 00:00:31,050
have filled in different answers for these three lines.
