1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,810
So the question is what is the largest sized

2
00:00:01,810 --> 00:00:04,360
index where we can do a lookup in about

3
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:07,150
one second? So if you look at the executions

4
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:09,620
we have, we've seen the time it takes with

5
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:15,080
an index with 10,000 is .0009 seconds. The time with

6
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:19,870
an index of 100,000 is .0085 seconds. And

7
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:22,210
your goal is to predict what the largest index

8
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:25,100
that can support lookups that finish within about one

9
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:29,355
second is. And your choices are 200,000 keywords,

10
00:00:29,355 --> 00:00:31,789
1,000,000 keywords, 10,000,000 keywords,

11
00:00:31,789 --> 00:00:34,763
100,000,000 keywords, or 1,000,000,000 keywords.
