1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,000
This is approximately 0.0011, which we get by dividing 0.001 by the normalizer 0.892,

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
and the posterior probability of being cancer-free after the test

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:25,000
is approximately 0.9989, and that's obtained by dividing this probability over here by the normalizer

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
and not surprisingly, these two values indeed add up to 1.

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Now, what's remarkable about this outcome is really what it means.

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Before the test, we had a 1% chance of having cancer,

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
now, we have about a 0.9% chance of having cancer.

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
So, a cancer probability went down by about a factor of 9.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
So, the test really helped us gaining confidence that we are cancer-free.

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Conversely, before we had a 99% chance of being cancer free, now it's 99.89%.

11
00:00:58,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So, all the numbers are working exactly how we expect them to work.
