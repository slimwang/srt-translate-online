00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,660
Here's a short quiz that looks at the principles we just covered.

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:09,130
Imagine that you have designed the following classes, one for a Motor, one for

3
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:11,990
a FancyMotor, and one for a Robot.

4
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:16,020
The Robot class contains within it an attribute of type motor.

5
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:16,540
That is,

6
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:21,460
it calls upon that motor to perform some computation, here called motor.run.

7
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:24,260
Assume that the Robot class is very complex, and

8
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:29,370
we now want to change it to instead make use of a new FancyMotor.

9
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:32,150
Making this change will difficult with the current design because it

10
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:34,600
violates which design principle?

11
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,430
There are five choices for you here.

12
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:41,330
There's the Substitution Principle, the Law of Demeter, the Hollywood principle,

13
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:45,540
the Dependency Inversion Principle, and the Open-Closed Principle.

14
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:47,500
Which of these is the one that's violated?
