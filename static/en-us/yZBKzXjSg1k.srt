1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:04,110
Okay, so here what I mean concretely by not doing this thing

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:06,980
over here any more. So here what I'm proposing we do now. We

3
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:09,170
take all the data, all of the training data we had, the

4
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:14,040
xy1, xy2, dot, dot, dot, xyn and we put it in a database

5
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,027
>> Ah-ha.

6
00:00:16,027 --> 00:00:19,390
>> And then next time we get some new x to look

7
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:22,630
at, we just look it up in the database. And we're done.

8
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:25,980
>> None of this fancy shmancy learning, none of this

9
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:32,130
producing an appropriate function like you know, wx+b, or what ever

10
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:34,740
the equation of a line is. None of that fancy stuff anymore.

11
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:36,980
We just stick in to the data base. People written data

12
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:39,410
base programs before. We'll look it up when we're done. We're done.Period

13
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:42,320
>> I feel like you've changed the paradigm.

14
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,540
>> Yes, I am a paradigm changer. So what do you think?

15
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:47,790
>> It's like, it's like disruptive. It's going to throw off the markets.

16
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:50,940
>> Yeah. It's going to change everything. So, what do you think?

17
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:53,260
>> well, I mean, so there's a bunch of

18
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:55,490
really cool things about this idea. Which is why

19
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:58,200
I'm excited. So one is it, you know, it

20
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:01,040
doesn't forget, right? So it actually is very reliable.

21
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:05,120
It's very ,um ,dependable, right, so if you put in an x, y pair you ask for the

22
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,160
x you're going to get that y back instead of

23
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:10,180
some kind, you know, crack potty, smooth version of it.

24
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:12,930
>> Right, so we don't, yeah that's a good point. So we look at this little

25
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:14,600
blue line over here, you'll notice that say,

26
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,960
for this little x over here, we're not going to

27
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,880
get back what we put in, so, it remembers, it's like an elephant. Good.

28
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,860
>> So that's kind of cool. Another thing is that

29
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:28,740
there's none of this wasted time, you know, doing learning [LAUGH].

30
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:30,890
It just takes the data and it, and it's, very

31
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:33,497
rapidly just puts it in the database. So [CROSSTALK] it's fast.

32
00:01:33,497 --> 00:01:36,060
>> It's fast. It's like. I like it when you say nice things

33
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:39,900
about my algorithms. Okay. So it's fast. Anything else, you can think of?

34
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,190
>> Sh, yeah I cant think of

35
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:43,480
one more thing at least.

36
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,075
>> Mm-hm.

37
00:01:44,075 --> 00:01:46,890
>> Which is ,that like you, it's simple.

38
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:49,990
>> [LAUGH] That's true. I am simple. I am simple and

39
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:53,180
straightforward. I just need a few things to make me happy.

40
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:53,990
>> Bacon.

41
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:54,680
>> Bacon, and

42
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,550
>> And

43
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:56,040
>> Chocolate.

44
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,160
>> Oh nice.

45
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,930
>> Have you ever had chocolate covered bacon?

46
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:00,580
>> That seems wrong.

47
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:03,030
>> You know, you would think so, but it turns out it's delicious. It's

48
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:07,420
like if you take fat, and sugar, and you put it together somehow you like

49
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:10,000
it [LAUGH] I'm not making this up you can buy

50
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,250
chocolate covered bacon, you're unsurprised to here in America. Okay, so

51
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:16,930
we've got three good things in remember stuff. So, you

52
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:19,830
know, none of this little noisy throwing away information. It's very

53
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:22,540
fast, you just stick it in a database. Using your

54
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:25,020
favorite data base. And looking up is going to be equally as

55
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:28,590
fast. And it's very simple. There's really no interesting learning

56
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:30,440
going on here. So it's the perfect algorithm when we're done.

57
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,610
>> Okay. I mean, I, it feels

58
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:34,900
like there's more that we need to say though.

59
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:35,250
>> Like what?

60
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:38,700
>> In particular the way that you wrote this, F of X equals look up of X. If

61
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,170
I give you one of the other points in

62
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:44,770
between ,then it will return no such point found.

63
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:47,220
Which means it's really quite conservative. It's not willing

64
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:48,510
to go out on a limb and say ,well

65
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:50,570
I haven't seen this before but. It ought to

66
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:53,880
be around here, instead it just says, I don't know.

67
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:57,920
>> Mm. So the down side of remembering is, no

68
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,615
generalization.

69
00:02:58,615 --> 00:03:02,650
>> [LAUGH] And I guess a similar sort of issue is that when you, when

70
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:06,920
you call it memorization, it makes, it reminds me of the issues that we saw with

71
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:10,190
regard to overfitting So, it bottles the noise

72
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,190
exactly, it bottles exactly what it was given.

73
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:15,900
So it's going to be very sensitive to noise. So it's kind of a yes and no.

74
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:18,430
>> So that's a little scary and, and it can over fit in a couple of

75
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:20,260
ways, I think it can over fit ,um,

76
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:23,350
by believing the data too much that is literally

77
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:25,930
believing all of it and what do you do if you

78
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:28,530
have couple ,uh, speaking in noise, what if you have you know

79
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:31,420
a couple of examples that are all the same. I have got

80
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:34,608
an x, shows up multiple times but each with a different y.

81
00:03:34,608 --> 00:03:37,130
>> Oh,the same x,ah, yeah, and so the look up

82
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:40,280
would return two different things and this algorithm or whatever

83
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,590
that you have described so far, wouldn't commit to either

84
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:45,260
of them and it would just say, hey, here is both.

85
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:46,820
>> Yeah, that seems problematic.

86
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:48,590
>> Okay, alright. But I feel like,

87
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:49,650
you know, you are going to to tell me, how

88
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:51,560
to fix those things. So I wasn't too worried.

89
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,300
>> Yeah, well, there is gotta be a nice way

90
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:56,220
of fixing it. I think There's sort of a basic problem

91
00:03:56,220 --> 00:04:01,640
here, which is that we're taking this remembering and then

92
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:04,120
looking up a little too literally, right? So I stick in

93
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,630
the data, and I can get back exactly the data

94
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:08,450
that I got, but I can't get back anything that I

95
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:10,440
don't have, and that seems like something that we might

96
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,760
be able to overcome if we're just a little bit clever.

97
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,650
>> Mm.

98
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:15,200
>> So let's see if we can be a little bit clever.
