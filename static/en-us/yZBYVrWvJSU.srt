1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,780
So why do we care about Virtualization?

2
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:05,520
Well, first it enables consolidation.

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:11,150
And consolidation is this ability to run
multiple virtual machines, with their

4
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:15,580
operating systems and applications,
on a single physical platform.

5
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:19,920
Consolidation then leads to
improved cost efficiency.

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:25,790
With pure machines, with less space,
potentially with fewer admins, and

7
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:31,240
with fewer electrical bills, we will be
able to run the same kind of workload.

8
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:36,630
So consolidation delivers benefits
because it allows us to decrease costs,

9
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:40,320
and also to improve
the manageability of the system.

10
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,740
In addition with Virtualization,
once the operating system

11
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:48,920
in its applications are nicely
encapsulated in a VM, and

12
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:51,760
decoupled from the actual
physical hardware.

13
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:56,320
It becomes more easy to migrate
the OS in the applications

14
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,980
from one physical machine to
another physical machine.

15
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:01,030
Or even to copy and

16
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:05,230
clone them onto multiple physical
machines at the same time.

17
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:09,350
As a result, Virtualization leads
to mechanisms that are useful

18
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:13,290
in order to provide greater
availability of the services.

19
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:17,330
Like, for instance, if we have
an increase in the load, we can just,

20
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:20,620
create multiple VMs and
address that issue.

21
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:23,650
So, increase the availability
of the system.

22
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:27,420
And also to provide solutions
that improve the reliability.

23
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:28,510
For instance,

24
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:32,890
if we detect that a particular hardware
node is getting hot and likely will

25
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:37,940
fail, we can just migrate those VMs
onto some other physical nodes.

26
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:40,380
There are other benefits
to Virtualization.

27
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:42,600
For instance because the OS and

28
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:46,600
the applications are nicely
encapsulated in a virtual machine.

29
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:52,320
It becomes more easy to contain any
kinds of bugs, or any kinds of malicious

30
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:57,180
behavior, to those resources that are
available to the virtual machine only,

31
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:01,470
and not to potentially affect
the entire hardware system.

32
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:03,400
Speaking of debugging, in particular,

33
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:06,145
Virtualization has delivered
some other benefits,

34
00:02:06,145 --> 00:02:11,430
that it has become a very important
platform for operating systems research.

35
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:15,570
It lets systems researchers quickly
introduce new operating system feature

36
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:18,450
and has them in the OS that's
encapsulated in the VM.

37
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:23,830
And then they have ability to more
quickly view the effects of that and

38
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:27,350
debug it as opposed to
a more traditional cycle,

39
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:30,980
which would have included hardware
restarts of the machines and

40
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:35,160
then searches through the log files or
the error files, etc.

41
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:39,930
Virtualization is also useful because
it provides affordable support for

42
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:41,680
legacy operating systems.

43
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,500
With Virtualization it's no
longer necessary to designate

44
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:49,230
some hardware resources for
some older operating system

45
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:53,080
just because it's needed to run one
particular application, for instance.

46
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:58,760
Instead, that legacy OS and applications
can be packaged in a virtual machine and

47
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:01,930
then can be co-allocated,
consolidated, on

48
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:05,860
the same hardware resources that support
other VMs and other applications.

49
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:08,860
And there are many other
benefits to Virtualization.

50
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:10,480
These are some of the key ones, though.
