1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:03,586
So let's start with a warm-up activity to create

2
00:00:03,586 --> 00:00:07,724
concepts for more, and less. We'll actually use these later

3
00:00:07,724 --> 00:00:11,126
as they're central to the conceptual model of the

4
00:00:11,126 --> 00:00:13,853
Time Bank. With the Time Bank, when we do tasks

5
00:00:13,853 --> 00:00:16,840
for someone, we get more time in our account.

6
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:19,100
And after someone does a task for us, when we

7
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:23,356
pay them, we get less time in our account. So

8
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:25,560
lets follow along with the students. So we're going to do

9
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:30,120
a very quick exercise. Get a new big piece of paper. Some of the things you need

10
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:36,820
to communicate in your wallet are conceptual models of more or less.

11
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:42,708
All right, so we're going to take a few minutes and you're going to do ten

12
00:00:42,708 --> 00:00:48,700
conceptual models of how you can show, how you can depict more or less/
