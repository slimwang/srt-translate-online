1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:02,530
So what are the different
product actions?

2
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:06,910
I'm going to leave you to
figure that out for yourself.

3
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:07,840
Go to the the reference for

4
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:13,500
product action, and
it's here in the android developer docs.

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:17,030
Or you could just search for
ProductAction.html in Google,

6
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:17,900
see what you come up with.

7
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:21,590
Anyway, the link's in
the instructor notes.

8
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:24,760
And read through the different kind
of product actions, and then come and

9
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:26,310
take this quiz.

10
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:28,617
What are some of
the actions of a product?

11
00:00:28,617 --> 00:00:31,740
ACTION_ADD is to add
an item to the cart.

12
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,790
But you figure out what
these other actions are, and

13
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:37,431
go ahead and
enter them in these fields here.
