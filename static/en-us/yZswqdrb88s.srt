A Logic Bomb is, essentially,
a trigger planted in a program.

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:08,670
When the triggering condition is met,
the planted code then execute.

3
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:09,660
In such a way,

4
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:14,190
malicious activities can be activated
whenever a condition is right.

5
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:19,005
For example, a branch of the program
will launch, denounce service attacks to

6
00:00:19,005 --> 00:00:24,930
whitehouse.gov only when the current
time is the specified time and date.

7
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:26,650
And that's an example of a logic bomb.
