It may not surprise you that as humans we use short cuts to help us make

2
00:00:03,491 --> 00:00:08,736
decisions. Heuristics are mental short cuts that we use to help us make complex

3
00:00:08,736 --> 00:00:12,040
decisions and judgments, and they often result in quick and efficient

4
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:17,890
decisions. Now, we'll talk about two main types of heuristics. The first is

5
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:22,527
representativeness heuristic. And here, we make estimates on the probability of

6
00:00:22,527 --> 00:00:27,829
an event based on how typical or representative it is of anther event. And the

7
00:00:27,829 --> 00:00:32,264
second, is the availability heuristic. And we use this strategy, we rely on the

8
00:00:32,264 --> 00:00:38,210
ease with which estimates some to mind, or how aware we're of those estimates.

9
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:41,610
But lets go to Lauren for a question on the availability heuristic.
