1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
In this problem, we are concerned with two types of energy, kinetic energy and potential energy.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Kinetic energy is due to the speed that is the length of the velocity vector

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
and it grows with speed in a quadratic fashion.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:20,000
It contains a factor of the velocity vector of the spacecraft, length of that vector squared,

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,000
meaning if increased the velocity by a vector of two, we are going to increase the kinetic energy

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
by a vector of four, which tells us that speeding is really dangerous.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
There was another factor in here, the mass of the spacecraft

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
and then there is an additional vector of one-half.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Potential energy concerns the position of the spacecraft.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,000
As we move the spacecraft away from earth, we have to invest energy

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
and that's going to become potential energy.

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
This is the distance of the spacecraft from the center of the earth.

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
When you fire the rockets to get it away from earth, you invest energy

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
and that energy leads to a change in potential energy.

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
In the case of gravity, it's easiest to have potential energy be negative all of the time

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
and only when the spacecraft reaches infinity, it's potential energy go to zero.

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:25,000
And the formula for that is pretty much related to Newton's universal law of gravity.

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
We've got the gravitational constant. We've got the product of the masses.

19
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Mass of the earth, mass of the spacecraft, and in this case, divided by the first power of the distance.

20
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,000
If you remember in the force, we have the second power of the distance.

21
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:52,000
And of course, we have the minus sign in front if we double the distance, we go to half that original value

22
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
but still with the minus sign and these are the only kinds of energy in our problem

23
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
and if energy conservation holds, we know the following.

24
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,000
The sum of these two energies has to be a constant. It must not depend on time.

25
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:15,000
It has to stay at its initial value and that's something we can use to check our numerical solutions

26
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
when this expression does not stay yet its original value, we do know that we're in trouble.

27
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Note that energy conservation does not hold in all models.

28
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
In particular, if we have friction and all the heat produced by that friction,

29
00:02:29,000 --> 99:59:59,999
energy won't be conserved.
