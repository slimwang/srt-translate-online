00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:03,140
In the case of a fully virtualized

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:07,540
hypoviser, the guest operating system has no knowledge

3
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:10,870
of machine pages. It thinks that it's physical

4
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:13,980
memory is contiguous because it is thinking that

5
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:16,314
it is running on bare metal, nothing has

6
00:00:16,314 --> 00:00:19,630
been changed in the operating system to run

7
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:22,190
on top of a hypervisor in a fully

8
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:26,430
virtualized setting. And therefore, it is the responsibility

9
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:29,500
of the hypervisor to maintain the PPN to

10
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:32,560
MPN mapping. In a para virtualized setting, on

11
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:35,750
the other hand, the guest operating system knows

12
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:38,220
that it is not running on bare metal.

13
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:40,480
It knows that there's a hypervisor in between

14
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,950
it, and the real hardware. And it knows,

15
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:47,460
therefore, that its physical memory is going to be

16
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:52,020
fragmented in the machine memory. So the mapping PPN

17
00:00:52,020 --> 00:01:00,220
to MPN can be kept in either the guest OS or the Hypervisor. But, usually,

18
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:04,040
it is kept in the guest operating system. We'll talk more about that later on.
