1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,814
Now that Grant's finally made a decision about which cleaning solution brand to

2
00:00:04,826 --> 00:00:09,410
go with, he's decided to sell all the different products he's marketing in a

3
00:00:09,422 --> 00:00:13,889
package. He's going to sell nozzles and wipers and cleaning solution for one

4
00:00:13,901 --> 00:00:18,301
fabulous deal. Taking all the various costs of creating his products and

5
00:00:18,313 --> 00:00:23,310
shipping them and everything into account, Grant calculates that he'll make a

6
00:00:23,322 --> 00:00:28,520
profit of $1000 for every 60 glasses cleaning sets that he sells. And if he

7
00:00:28,532 --> 00:00:33,960
sells 100 glasses cleaning sets he'll make a profit of $1200, assuming that the

8
00:00:33,972 --> 00:00:38,835
relationship between number of cleaning sets sold and profits is linear, or in

9
00:00:38,847 --> 00:00:44,247
other words lies on a straight line, we should be able to predict, how much of a

10
00:00:44,259 --> 00:00:49,294
profit Grant will make, for any number of glasses cleaning sets that he might

11
00:00:49,306 --> 00:00:54,489
sell. It would be really great if we could plot this information on a graph. And

12
00:00:54,501 --> 00:00:59,246
then use that graph to find out about other points on the line. If we let x

13
00:00:59,258 --> 00:01:04,810
equal the number of cleaning sets that Grant sells and y equal his profit in

14
00:01:04,822 --> 00:01:10,976
dollars, can you write each of these pieces of information as a point on the

15
00:01:10,988 --> 00:01:14,177
line that we're going to be able to draw?
