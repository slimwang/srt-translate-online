00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:06,230
You've got your
Google Analytics account ID,

00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:10,080
and you've enabled auto tracking for
all your activities.

00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,990
You started learning your
way around the Dashboard,

00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:15,190

screen views.

00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:19,600
In the next lesson, we'll delve into how
to code your app to track events, and
