00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,241
We know that in the last example we were working with, we didn't have a

2
00:00:03,241 --> 00:00:07,822
horizontal asymptote. But do we have something else instead? Well, we're going

3
00:00:07,822 --> 00:00:13,246
to check out a slightly simpler example right now to get some ideas about that.

4
00:00:13,246 --> 00:00:19,686
Let's consider f of x equals 2x squared plus 3x minus 7 Over X minus 2. What do

5
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:23,994
we get if we use long division to divide the numerator by the denominator?
