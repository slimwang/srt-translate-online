1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:05,200
Since P is 4 units to the left of
the origin, it's x coordinate is -4.

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:10,170
Since it's 4 units below the origin,
its y coordinate is also -4.

3
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:14,740
So we can represent P by
the ordered pair (-4, -4).

4
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:19,775
Similarly Q can be represented
as the ordered pair (4,-

5
00:00:19,775 --> 00:00:26,240
2 ) since it is 4 units to the right
of the origin and 2 units below it.

6
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,510
Remember that the only properties
that distinguish vectors

7
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:31,570
are their magnitude and direction.

8
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:33,970
Vectors don't have a location property.

9
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:37,920
So we only need to know the amount of
change in the x and y directions for

10
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,870
each vector to represent
them in coordinates.

11
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:45,510
Since V moves one unit left
its X coordinate is minus one.

12
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:49,960
And since V moves four units up,
its Y coordinate is four.

13
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:55,940
Finally, since W moves two units left,
its X coordinate is minus two and

14
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:59,170
since it has no vertical movement,
its Y coordinate is zero.
