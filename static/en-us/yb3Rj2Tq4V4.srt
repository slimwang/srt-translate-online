1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:01,859
Here are the redundant sections.

2
00:00:01,859 --> 00:00:05,040
They were 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, and 11.

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,570
If we go back to the code,
we can confirm this.

4
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:11,250
For each network request that we
currently have in the project,

5
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:14,550
we need the API key, so
that's definitely redundant.

6
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:18,930
Then, we always need to build
the URL and the request object, but

7
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:21,180
sometimes the path
extension is different.

8
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:24,760
So the path extension part
itself is not redundant, or

9
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:27,460
the same,
between our different network requests.

10
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:31,440
Moving on, creating the network
task is always the same.

11
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:35,310
However in the completion handler,
we may handle errors differently.

12
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:39,150
For example, on both of these methods,
we may want to display an error back to

13
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:43,770
the user in the login view itself, but
that doesn't always have to be the case.

14
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:48,540
We may have a network request for
adding or removing favorite movies, and

15
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:51,660
for that we might want to use
an alert view or something different.

16
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:54,830
Next as we keep scrolling,
we always make the same guard checks,

17
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:58,780
these three here, and
then we always convert our data,

18
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:02,130
our deserialize the JSON
into a usable dictionary.

19
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:05,710
So these sections are redundant.

20
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:08,640
This is the big difference in our
code after we have the dictionary and

21
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,760
we start looking for
the values that we need.

22
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,430
So for all the other redundant
code that we've seen above and

23
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:18,340
even the task.resume,
this is redundant as well.

24
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:21,200
We need to move this
into something reusable.

25
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,890
And if you're thinking, hey why not move
the redundant code into a function or

26
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:27,000
method, then you're on the right track.

27
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:27,800
We're going to do this next.
