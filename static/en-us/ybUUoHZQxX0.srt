1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,940
So we've been talking about simplifying terms in the context of simplifying

2
00:00:03,952 --> 00:00:07,893
expressions for a while, and our whole goal with doing all this is to make our

3
00:00:07,905 --> 00:00:11,796
expressions look prettier. To make them easier to read, but still let us know

4
00:00:11,808 --> 00:00:15,612
what kind of math we're talking about. So something we're doing a lot of is

5
00:00:15,624 --> 00:00:20,045
taking shortcuts. In fact, most of the time that you do this, you probably don't

6
00:00:20,057 --> 00:00:24,060
even realize that, that's what's happening. Lets say for example that we have

7
00:00:24,072 --> 00:00:27,945
something like 2 plus 2, plus 2, plus 2, plus 2. So we have five 2's added

8
00:00:27,957 --> 00:00:32,072
together. Now normally if we wanted to express this quantity, we wouldn't write

9
00:00:32,084 --> 00:00:36,249
it this way. We wouldn't write all the 2's added together. Instead we would say,

10
00:00:36,342 --> 00:00:40,302
okay, how many 2's do you want to add? 5, well that's just the same as 5 times

11
00:00:40,302 --> 00:00:46,172
2, since we've added 2 to itself 5 times. So as it turns out, multiplication is

12
00:00:46,184 --> 00:00:51,408
actually just a major short cut to repeated addition. In the same way, we can

13
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:56,959
use exponents to indicate repeated multiplication of the same number. So let's

14
00:00:56,971 --> 00:01:01,598
say that instead of having 2 plus 2 plus 2 plus 2 plus 2 We have 5 2's

15
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:05,453
multiplied together. In this case, we can use another kind of shortcut. We can

16
00:01:05,465 --> 00:01:09,389
rewrite this using an exponent, Just like we talked about in the last quiz. You

17
00:01:09,401 --> 00:01:13,382
may have already had a lot practice with exponents in previous courses, but just

18
00:01:13,394 --> 00:01:17,267
in case you've forgotten exactly how they work, we're going to talk about that

19
00:01:17,279 --> 00:01:21,285
right now. So let's write this, these 5 2's multiplied together, using

20
00:01:21,297 --> 00:01:25,722
exponential notation. So we're going to start by identifying the number that we

21
00:01:25,734 --> 00:01:29,918
want to multiply it by itself. So in that case this is 2. So let's write that

22
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:34,125
down, and then we count how many of these 2's are multiplied together. So we

23
00:01:34,137 --> 00:01:38,255
know that we have 5, And we take that number 5, The number of 2s we're

24
00:01:38,267 --> 00:01:42,520
multiplying. And we write that as a superscript of 2. So superscript is just a

25
00:01:42,532 --> 00:01:46,915
small number written to the upper right-hand corner of this other number. And we

26
00:01:46,927 --> 00:01:51,215
call 2, the number that we're multiplying over and over again, the b ase number,

27
00:01:51,312 --> 00:01:55,897
and we this little 5, its exponent. Now, since you're going to be entering most

28
00:01:55,909 --> 00:01:59,951
of your answers on a computer for this class, or probably all of your answers,

29
00:02:00,046 --> 00:02:04,262
actually, considering this is an online course, you're going to have to type in

30
00:02:04,274 --> 00:02:08,366
answers with exponents in a special way. So what you do is you type in the base

31
00:02:08,377 --> 00:02:12,288
number, normally, so you would type in a 2. But then, in order to type the

32
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:16,309
number that's in the exponent, or in order to indicate that this 5 is in this

33
00:02:16,321 --> 00:02:20,669
exponent slot, we need to write a caret before the 5. So these are the three

34
00:02:20,681 --> 00:02:25,425
keys that you will type, in order, to enter this exact answer on a computer.

35
00:02:25,533 --> 00:02:30,344
It's like this little arrow here is pointing up to indicate that this number

36
00:02:30,356 --> 00:02:35,430
that follows it is going to be in that higher elevated exponent position, as you

37
00:02:35,442 --> 00:02:40,300
can see down here. Now if you have more than just a number in the exponent, then

38
00:02:40,312 --> 00:02:44,140
you put parentheses around the entire expression that you want to have

39
00:02:44,152 --> 00:02:44,922
positioned in that exponent spot.
