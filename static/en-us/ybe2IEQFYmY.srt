Determining the top line, top visible line and

00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:05,810
the number of lines together tells us which lines will be displayed.

00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:09,490
This determination is based on the attributes of the viewport, its size,

4
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:14,230
the file manager, its document size, and the scrollbar, the handle positions.

5
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:18,020
Hence there is an association, a three way association, amongst all three

00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:22,800
components. You can also call that a ternary, as opposed to binary, association.

7
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,860
Let's call this association displays, as in the view port displays the contents

00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:30,660
provided by the file manager and determined by the scroll bar
