Great job.

2
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:04,280
You've just gotten to know your
computer just a little bit better.

3
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:06,810
The deeper into code you'll get, the
more you'll find yourself needing to use

4
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:09,110
the command line interface
to get things done.

5
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:12,020
I highly recommend you keep
practicing navigating your computer

6
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:14,230
from the terminal as
you continue learning,

7
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:16,309
even if it might be tempting to
just drag and drop some files.
