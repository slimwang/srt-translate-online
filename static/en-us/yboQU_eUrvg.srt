1
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:04,000
We're finally done with lesson four.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,160
And now you can hear the pronunciation
of each word in the app.

3
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:08,920
So we've covered a lot
of difficult topics.

4
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:10,768
But I'm really proud of you.

5
00:00:10,768 --> 00:00:12,540
So we learned how to
play audio in the app,

6
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:15,650
as well as how to handle audio
interruptions from other apps and

7
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:18,850
we even covered how to work with
Activity Lifecycle on Android.

8
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:22,830
But most of all you practiced
skills to learn a new Android API.

9
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:27,040
So you read tutorials and blog posts and
even created a small sample app

10
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:29,537
to learn how to apply that
information to improve the app.

11
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:34,160
Now as you come across new Android
topics on things that interest you,

12
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,640
topics like notifications or

13
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:40,130
location, you can use the same approach
to add more features to your app.

14
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:40,770
Now, best of luck.
