1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:04,460
Now, one of the cool things is,
you can actually measure the center

2
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:09,580
surroundedness of a ganglion
cell while it's working, okay.

3
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:13,080
I wouldn't recommend doing this to you
or to anybody else you have any care for

4
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:16,990
whatsoever, but basically,
the way you do recordings is here,

5
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:19,630
here's a schematic of a neuron.

6
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:25,540
So it has dendrites where they receive
inputs from the synapses, and when the,

7
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:29,990
the inputs are correct, they will
generate a spike, a firing down here,

8
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:35,140
and then these terminals impact the next
nerves that it's in contact with.

9
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:38,320
And if you were to put
an electrode right over here,

10
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,320
you would occasionally see these spikes.

11
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:46,330
And neural coding, we tend to refer
to as the more spikes per second

12
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:51,350
is a higher level, so we've gone
essentially from analog to digital.

13
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:53,530
Right?
In an analog system,

14
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:56,870
the amount of the voltage tells you
how high it is or how low it is.

15
00:00:56,870 --> 00:01:00,680
In a digital system, there's something
discrete that tells us, okay, you know,

16
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,800
there's 15 ones and two zeroes,

17
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,670
that's a higher number than
all zeroes or, et cetera.

18
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:07,950
Well in, in the neural system,
the way we do is,

19
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:11,270
we look at how,
how often is the neuron firing.

20
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:12,640
And you can actually go ahead and
do this.

21
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,150
This is a picture of a a micropipette,

22
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:19,670
an electrode getting ready
to record from a neuron.

23
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:22,790
So you do these with neurons
that are still living, right?

24
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:26,282
This is why I said you wouldn't want to
do this to anybody you cared for,

25
00:01:26,282 --> 00:01:27,220
all right?

26
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:31,780
And what you can do is,
you can then put different kinds of

27
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:36,870
stimuli at different locations in
the eye and see what happens, all right.

28
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:42,010
And if you do that,
you can find areas, so here we have,

29
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:47,700
when it's just black, this neuron
doesn't do things very much, okay?

30
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:53,420
But when it's white in the middle,
okay, and black out here, all right.

31
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:56,330
And, and what this is, oh, by the way,
this is time going this way.

32
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:59,650
So this is when the,
the spot was turned on.

33
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:03,400
You can see when it goes from the back,
this is called the background activity.

34
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,060
When it goes from the background,
when it turns on,

35
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:06,670
this thing starts firing crazy.

36
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:09,220
And then you turn it off and
it stops again.

37
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:10,330
Okay, fine.

38
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:15,740
But what's then cool is,
if I then turn on a really bright spot.

39
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:16,520
Okay?

40
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,190
Nothing happens.

41
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:19,640
It stays just like my background.

42
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:23,820
And in fact, if I want to
turn the cell off even more,

43
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:28,080
I turn on just the outside and
I make the middle black.

44
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,090
And here what you can see is,

45
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:31,580
it actually just shut down
the background altogether.

46
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:34,290
And then when I turn the thing off,
it wakes back up again and

47
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:36,210
then returns back to its normal.

48
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:39,200
So this is an on cell.

49
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:39,890
Okay.

50
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:42,370
That is, its center is positive.

51
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:45,650
Exact opposite cell here is negative.

52
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:46,350
Okay.

53
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:49,570
And both are found in the,
in the retina.

54
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:54,510
The other thing that's found in
the retina are ganglion cells whose

55
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:57,940
size in terms of their
response Is different.

56
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:01,376
So there are ones for very small,
for medium and larger.

57
00:03:01,376 --> 00:03:06,450
And your system is actually tuned to
have more of a particular size, and

58
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:09,900
that tuning is what gives
you this phenomena.

59
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:10,704
So, again,

60
00:03:10,704 --> 00:03:14,667
this is going to be a function of
how your monitor is calibrated.

61
00:03:14,667 --> 00:03:15,540
All right.

62
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:19,850
But the, contrast sensitivity function,
so for me,

63
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:24,505
so what this is is, this is
a sinusoid where the frequency gets,

64
00:03:24,505 --> 00:03:29,958
goes up this way, and contrast goes up
as you get further down, all right?

65
00:03:29,958 --> 00:03:32,250
And the question is,
where can you see the bars?

66
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:37,500
And for me, I can see the bars
kind of like, oh, like that.

67
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,940
Okay.

68
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:42,150
So the question is,
why can't I see the stuff here, but

69
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:45,950
I can see the stuff there, for
the same level of contrast?

70
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:51,010
The answer is, my retina has more and

71
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:58,410
better tuned receptors at this size
frequency than at this size frequency.

72
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:01,340
This phenomena that you're seeing
is a function of what goes on

73
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:03,600
inside your eyeball.

74
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,660
And that can be graphed
out looking like this.

75
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:07,083
Two things interesting about this graph.

76
00:04:07,083 --> 00:04:10,380
First is,
this is a function of frequency.

77
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:13,410
And, here they use
different luminance levels.

78
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:15,550
So they make it brighter and,
or brighter and,

79
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:17,779
it's sort of how sensitive you are.

80
00:04:17,779 --> 00:04:22,450
And then something, and for the PETA
folks amongst you, please ignore this.

81
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:25,100
You'll notice that the human data and

82
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:28,950
the macaque, macaque is a type of
monkey, are very, very similar.

83
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:33,200
Now, this is done, of course, without
doing anything to anybody, right?

84
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,850
You just ask them what do you see,
et cetera.

85
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:39,970
But what this data show is that the
vision system, the retinal vision system

86
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:43,920
of the macaque monkey is really
quite similar to the human.

87
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:48,390
So if you were to do experiments on
primates measuring physiological things,

88
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:51,400
remember those electrodes,
we have reason to believe that what

89
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:55,440
we learn there is the same,
would apply also to the human system.

90
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,790
So, when you have psychophysical
experiments like this,

91
00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:01,180
it shows you the similarity
between human and macaque.
