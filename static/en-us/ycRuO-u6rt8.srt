00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
In the graph, we can talk about something called an Eulerian path.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This is the path that starts off with some node on the graph, let's say A in this case.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
And it moves along the edges from node to node,

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
hitting every edge exactly once, and then ending it from node to the graph.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
In this case, we have an Eulerian path that's started at A and ended with D.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Euler by the way was a famous mathematician, Leonhard Euler.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
He made a number of contributions to discrete math and ultimately, computer science.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Here's something that we can notice about a graph.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
If it has a Eulerian path, notice what has to happen to all the nodes along the path.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Here's what we did in this example, we went from A to B, to D, to A, to C, to D.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Now let's consider the degree of all the nodes in the graph.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:49,000
A has a degree of 3, B has a degree of 2, D has a degree of 3, and C has a degree of 2.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Notice that these nodes B and C, which were not either at the beginning or ending of the path,

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
the Eulerian path, have an even degree and that has to be.

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
What happens if all the nodes that are not in the beginning and ending nodes

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
have to had even degree because the path has to go in one edge and out another edge.

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Every time that node gets passed through, 2 of the edges are visited,

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
and none of them are visited twice and none of them are skipped.

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
So it has to be that all these nodes that are intermediate on the path have even degree.

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
The beginning and ending nodes are different though.

21
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:26,000
If the path starts off at A and leaves A along one of the edges and that consumes one of those edges.

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The beginning and ending nodes, A and D in this case, have to have odd degree

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
because, in addition to any times that the path moves through them and comes up the other side,

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
it either leaves in the beginning or enters at the end without a corresponding other side.

25
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Those have to be odd, all the other ones have to be even.

26
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
It turns out that this relationship is in "if and only if"--that is to say if the graph is connected

27
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:55,000
and has exactly 2 odd degree nodes, then it has an Eulerian path, and if not, then it doesn't.

28
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Now, there is one exception to this. What if all of the nodes in the graph are even degree?

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Let's take a quick look at a special case here.

30
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Here is a graph with 5 nodes and the degree of all of the nodes is even--2, 4, 2, 4, and 2.

31
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Can a graph like this with only even degree nodes have an Eulerian path?

32
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
One possible answer is no, the start and the end edges of the path had to have odd degree,

33
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
which is the ruling in this case, so it can't have an Eulerian path.

34
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Another possible answer is yes, but it depends on the particulars of the graph in question.

35
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Some graphs with only even degree nodes have Eulerian paths and some don't.

36
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Another possibility is that the answer is yes, all such graphs do.

37
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Any graph that's connected and has only even degree nodes

38
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
will have an Eulerian path in a particular form.

39
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Another possible answer is yes, because all graphs do.

40
00:02:48,000 --> 99:59:59,999
You can't really have a graph that doesn't have an Eulerian path.
