00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:04,370
We've seen a variety of graphics and their visual encodings up to this point.

2
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:07,470
But we haven't discussed which of these is most effective.

3
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:10,440
How should we know whether to encode a quantitative variable,

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:14,170
in color saturation, or rather than, say, position?

5
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:18,430
Fortunately, some passionate researchers have answered this question for us.

6
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:20,800
In a 1985 paper, William Cleveland and

7
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,720
Robert McGill share the results of a series of experimental user studies.

8
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,520
These studies were designed to compare the effectiveness of

9
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:31,890
display elements like position, length, angle, and others.

10
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:35,600
They were trying to see how effective using codings were in terms of

11
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,840
users being able to interpret quantitative information,

12
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:41,290
that is exact numbers from the graphs.

13
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:44,510
This paper was the first of its kinds to validate the ranking of

14
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:47,890
encodings using, empirical evidence and as it

15
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:53,000
turns out position along a common scale is the most accurate of the encodings.

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,180
Color saturation or density on the other hand was less accurate.

17
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:01,670
For the Gat Minor visualization, this is why the most important variables,

18
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:07,070
Income per person and Life expectancy were encoded using position.

19
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:09,480
It's the most accurate of the bunch.

20
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:14,060
The key takeaway here is that if you want to design effective visualizations,

21
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:17,260
then you need to understand the rankings of visual encodings and

22
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:19,530
choose appropriate encodings in your designs.
