As always we want to start by looking for our greatest common factor. And yes

2
00:00:03,562 --> 00:00:09,345
indeed, there is one. It's 5. We take up the 5, leaving us with x squared minus

3
00:00:09,345 --> 00:00:14,344
4y squared. I can see that this line is really a greatest common factor times a

4
00:00:14,344 --> 00:00:19,715
squared minus b squared. Our a is x and our b is 2y. So here's our final answer.

5
00:00:19,716 --> 00:00:25,493
5 times x plus 2y, times x minus 2y. This is our factored form.
