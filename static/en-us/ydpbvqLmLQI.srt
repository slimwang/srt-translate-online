00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,202
>> So we can see that this distribution is more spread out than this one. How

2
00:00:05,202 --> 00:00:10,825
can we quantify this spreadoutness? How about we look at the maximum value and

3
00:00:10,825 --> 00:00:16,648
the minimum value and find the distance between them? Let's say here that the

4
00:00:16,648 --> 00:00:23,485
maximum value is 78,600 and that the minimum value is 21,180. And then let's say

5
00:00:23,485 --> 00:00:31,281
here that the maximum value is 116,020 and that the minimum value here is 7,350.

6
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:39,009
What's the range for this distribution, or the maximum value minus the minimum

7
00:00:39,009 --> 00:00:44,083
value? And what's the range for this distribution?
