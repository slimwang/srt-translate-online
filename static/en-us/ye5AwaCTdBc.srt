00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:04,200
When we use any manmade tool or device,
we typically look to its form and

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,810
design to give us an idea of
what it does and how it works.

3
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:09,429
A classic example is a kettle.

4
00:00:09,429 --> 00:00:12,602
I can look at this kettle and recognize
that the handle side is the one I'm

5
00:00:12,602 --> 00:00:14,890
meant to grab,
even if I've never seen one before,

6
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:18,167
because I've seen the same basic shape
on things like coffee mugs, pots,

7
00:00:18,167 --> 00:00:19,912
pitchers, and various other things.

8
00:00:19,912 --> 00:00:21,197
It serves a practical purpose.

9
00:00:21,197 --> 00:00:24,756
It's shaped so I can comfortably get
my hand around it, and it's insulated.

10
00:00:24,756 --> 00:00:28,285
But also, the fact that I've seen many
similar handles before gives me a visual

11
00:00:28,285 --> 00:00:29,440
clue here.

12
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:32,226
After all, I could probably pick
the kettle up by the spout if I really

13
00:00:32,226 --> 00:00:34,680
wanted, although I'd probably
end up burning myself, and

14
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,571
it'd be pretty tricky to
pour water out of it.

15
00:00:36,571 --> 00:00:38,476
When it comes to graphical
user interfaces,

16
00:00:38,476 --> 00:00:41,140
affordances still represent
the actions we can take.

17
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:44,299
But now they moment of far is cool
since there's no physical object to

18
00:00:44,299 --> 00:00:45,093
interact with.

19
00:00:45,093 --> 00:00:49,860
Some classic examples of technology
affordances are buttons, you will be

20
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:53,790
hard pressed to find any software UI
without at least one button on it, and

21
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:57,059
sliders from scroll bars to
playback controls to price limits.

22
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:02,250
Something I like to think about is how
real world objects get translated into

23
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:04,890
purely visual metaphors to
create those affordance cues for

24
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:07,040
graphical user interfaces.

25
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,800
For example, you can clearly see
a button on a keyboard reflected in

26
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:13,700
a button element and a checkbox on
a ballot paper in a checkbox element.

27
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:17,620
While some graphical UI
influences may not be immediately

28
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:19,680
obvious to new users, for example,

29
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,490
someone new to computers might need to
experiment to learn to use scroll bars.

30
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:27,630
People generally learn the visual cues
quickly with little or no training.

31
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:31,180
Well designed affordances enable people
to do something with as little training

32
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:31,780
as possible.
