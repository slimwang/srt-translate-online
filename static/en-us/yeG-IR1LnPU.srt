1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:04,610
Let's being by loading up our core scene
called Udacity Monitor Department.

2
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:07,540
First, go to your assets folder.

3
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:11,880
Then go to the Udacity
Monitor Department folder and

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:12,520
double click on it.

5
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:17,230
Then double click on scenes and

6
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:20,480
then double click on the Udacity
monitor department scene.

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,750
It's the one with the Unity logo.

8
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:27,250
Great, now for starters,
let's create a new material.

9
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:32,305
Go to the Project pane and
select the Assets directory,

10
00:00:32,305 --> 00:00:34,517
then click the Create button.

11
00:00:34,517 --> 00:00:38,330
And inside of here you'll see kinds of
assets you can create inside of Unity.

12
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:44,220
Go ahead and select Material, and
then give your material a new name.

13
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:48,400
So I'm going to call mine,
my new material.

14
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:54,230
Okay, this material represents
a thing called a shader and

15
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:55,460
its associated settings.

16
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,650
We'll talk more about shaders later.

17
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:02,810
For now, just know that they're
programs responsible for

18
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:05,301
creating the final images
shown on your VR headset.

19
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:10,220
Over here,
you can see the materials properties and

20
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:12,320
you'll see all kinds of options.

21
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:17,220
These are all the options for
Unity standard shader.

22
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:20,060
And, we'll talk about it
more later in the course.

23
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:22,970
For now,
let's just test out the albedo property.

24
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:27,110
Unless you've worked with
physically based rendering,

25
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:30,280
you're probably wondering
what albedo means.

26
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:34,420
The albedo parameter defines how
light changes when it gets reflected

27
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:35,069
by a surface.

28
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:40,720
For example, white lights falls on
to my shirt and comes back blue.

29
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,750
That's the albedo parameter,
the shirt material.

30
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:47,610
For now, just think of the albedo
as the material's main color.

31
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:52,640
Okay, go ahead and
change the albedo to a bright red color

32
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,070
by first clicking on this white box and
then selecting a nice red color.

33
00:01:58,190 --> 00:02:00,090
Okay, go ahead and
close the color picker.

34
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:05,100
Now, we're going to assign this red
material to the apartment's floor and

35
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:05,630
walls.

36
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:10,880
Go ahead and drag and drop your new
material onto the apartment floor.

37
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:16,430
Okay, we have a really really red room.

38
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:17,990
Maybe let's dial it back a little.

39
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:23,788
Go back to your material and
change the albedo to a bright pink.

40
00:02:23,788 --> 00:02:28,800
There, that's better-ish.

41
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,500
Maybe white walls weren't so
bad after all.

42
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:35,930
Anyway, now you know one way to create
materials and assign them to objects.
