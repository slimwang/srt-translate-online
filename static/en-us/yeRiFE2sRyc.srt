1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:02,455
Let's make sure we made the same observations.

2
00:00:02,455 --> 00:00:08,060
Now, not all observable elements are actually visible on the page.

3
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:10,950
So, this first answer actually isn't correct.

4
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:15,030
However, all highlighted elements are rectangular.

5
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:17,030
And if you go deep enough into the structure,

6
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:19,910
you can read the same text as printed on the page.

7
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:22,770
If we go back to our browser, you'll notice that every element in

8
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:26,080
the structure as we mouse over it is a rectangle.

9
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,820
Also, if we go deep enough into the structure,

10
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:31,420
we can find the same text that's printed on the page.
