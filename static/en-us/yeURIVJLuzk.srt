1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,062
Actually, as much as it might surprise
you, we've been doing algebra right here.

2
00:00:04,062 --> 00:00:09,120
These 2 symbols, the square and the
triangle that we assigned to replace the

3
00:00:09,132 --> 00:00:13,462
words that we had written earlier are
called variables. In algebra we make a

4
00:00:13,462 --> 00:00:18,725
distinction between numbers and variables.
Numbers are well, numbers, like 3,000,000

5
00:00:18,725 --> 00:00:24,810
or 100,000, and variables are generally
represented by symbols or single letters.

6
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:29,043
A variable doesn't have a set value like a
number does. Instead, it's value is

7
00:00:29,043 --> 00:00:33,043
allowed to vary depending on what we
decide that it should equal. We'll talk more

8
00:00:33,043 --> 00:00:37,755
about how we make decisions about that
soon. Numbers will appear either as

9
00:00:37,767 --> 00:00:42,750
constant terms on their own, just numbers
like 3,000,000 right here, or in terms

10
00:00:42,762 --> 00:00:47,300
that combine numbers and variables like
this last one on the right. When

11
00:00:47,312 --> 00:00:51,430
multiplied by a variable or set of
variables, a number is called a

12
00:00:51,442 --> 00:00:56,769
coefficient. So again, going back to our
variables, I could of chosen any two

13
00:00:56,769 --> 00:01:01,760
symbols I wanted to represent these two
quantities right here, the square and the

14
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,529
triangle. I didn't have to choose the
triangle and I didn't have to choose the

15
00:01:04,541 --> 00:01:08,987
square. In fact picking these two
particular symbols, is actually pretty

16
00:01:08,987 --> 00:01:12,422
unconventional in math. To give you a
preview of what you're usually going to be

17
00:01:12,434 --> 00:01:16,692
seeing during this course, I'll write this
equation out with more typical notation.

18
00:01:16,972 --> 00:01:21,782
We'll most often see the letters X and Y
as your variables in equations in algebra.

19
00:01:21,885 --> 00:01:26,538
You can also see I've removed the dollar
signs and the commas from the original

20
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:31,401
equation down here to make this equation
look a little bit more clean and strictly

21
00:01:31,413 --> 00:01:36,551
mathematical. You'll notice that I also
sneakily deleted the multiplication sign

22
00:01:36,551 --> 00:01:40,700
we had in the top equation, and didn't
write it down here at the bottom. When we

23
00:01:40,712 --> 00:01:44,660
have single terms that involve both
numbers and variables multiplied together,

24
00:01:44,752 --> 00:01:49,508
we don't usually write the multiplication
sign in, like I did at the top. As long as

25
00:01:49,508 --> 00:01:52,660
we write the symbols directly next to each
other, with nothing in between,

26
00:01:52,752 --> 00:01:56,640
multiplication is assumed to be happening
between them. It's like there's an

27
00:01:56,652 --> 00:02:00,644
invisible multiplication sign written
right here. I'm going to erase that

28
00:02:00,656 --> 00:02:04,496
though, to remind us that we're not
usually going to see any multiplication

29
00:02:04,511 --> 00:02:08,276
signs written between numbers and
variables. Although people doing math

30
00:02:08,276 --> 00:02:12,994
often use the variables y and x in their
equations, I really want you to remember

31
00:02:12,994 --> 00:02:18,177
that this is not necessary. Triangles and
squares are just as useful as x's and y's.

32
00:02:18,302 --> 00:02:23,162
No matter what symbol you choose to write
a variable with, the power that it has is

33
00:02:23,174 --> 00:02:27,316
still the same. It acts as a slot where we
can insert different numbers to make terms

34
00:02:27,316 --> 00:02:31,830
and expressions take on different values.
So maybe I set this first variable equal

35
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:37,926
to 3 and the second equal to -1 or
maybe this is -1/2 and this is 23.

36
00:02:38,172 --> 00:02:41,980
In certain situations, there will be
restrictions placed on what different

37
00:02:41,992 --> 00:02:46,200
variables can equal. But, until we have
more information about what they equal, we

38
00:02:46,212 --> 00:02:50,563
leave them written as variables, showing
that their values are still sort of a

39
00:02:50,563 --> 00:02:52,102
mystery to us.
