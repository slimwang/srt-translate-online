00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:02,029
Now let's convert this into a quiz. Now

2
00:00:02,029 --> 00:00:04,500
remember, that we use this tree to find out

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:07,430
our representation. We need one bit for sending

4
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:10,840
A, two for D, and three each for B

5
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:13,390
and C. So, if you send a message

6
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:17,150
in this language, what is the expected message size?

7
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:20,530
Write your answer down here. Remember the unit for

8
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:23,730
this answer is going to be in bits. Go.
