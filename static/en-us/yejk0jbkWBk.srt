00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:04,279
Let's now calculate the effect size measure Cohen's d. Just like before with

2
00:00:04,279 --> 00:00:08,468
the one sample t test. Cohen's d is the mean difference divided by the standard

3
00:00:08,468 --> 00:00:13,162
deviation for the differences. Remember that the mean differences was negative

4
00:00:13,162 --> 00:00:17,631
2.72. And the standard deviation was 3.69. Calculate Cohen's d? Just like

5
00:00:17,631 --> 00:00:19,740
before with the one sample t test.
