1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
So there're important lessons in what we just learned,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
the key thing is we talked about conditional probabilities.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
We said that the outcome in a variable, like a test

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
is actually not like the random coin flip

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
but it depends on something else,

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
like a disease.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
When we looked at this,

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
we were able to predict

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
what's the probability of a test outcome

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
even if we don't know whether the person has a disease or not.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
And we did this using the truth table,

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
and in the truth table,

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
we summarized multiple lines.

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
For example, we multiplied the probability of a test outcome

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
condition on this unknown variable,

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
whether the person is diseased

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
multiplied by the probability of the disease being present.

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Then we added a second row of the truth table,

19
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
where our unobserved disease variable

20
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
took the opposite value of not diseased.

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Written this way, it looks really clumsy,

22
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
but that's effectively what we did when we went to the truth table.

23
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
So we now understand that certain coin flips

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
are dependent on other coin flips,

25
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
so if god, for example, flips the coin of us having a disease or not,

26
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
then the medical test again

27
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
has a random outcome,

28
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
but its probability really depends on whether we have the disease or not.

29
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
We have to consider this when we do probabilistic inference.

30
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
In the next unit,

31
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
we're going to ask the real question.

32
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Say we really care about whether we have a disease like cancer or not.

33
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
What do you think the probability is,

34
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
given that our doctor

35
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
just gave us a positive test result?

36
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
And I can tell you,

37
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
you will be in for a surprise.
