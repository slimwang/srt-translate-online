00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:04,434
This isn't an algorithm because the procedure doesn't always terminate. Let's

2
00:00:04,434 --> 00:00:10,674
try running it on the example I gave. Initially, it's not an order. So, Robby

3
00:00:10,674 --> 00:00:16,590
would locate the first two bricks that don't match and swap them. Now, they're

4
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:20,160
still not in order. So again, Robbie would find the first pair of blocks that

5
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:27,030
doesn't match. And swap them. We're now back exactly where we started. If

6
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:29,730
Robbie keeps doing the same thing, again and again, he'll always end up right

7
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:33,385
back where he started. The bricks will never end up in order. So this is not an

8
00:00:33,385 --> 00:00:37,750
algorithm. Robbie's batteries will run out before this algorithm finishes, or

9
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:40,560
all the batteries and generators in the world would run out before this process

10
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,213
finishes. He will never finish.
