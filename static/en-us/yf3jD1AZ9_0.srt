1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:03,018
Consider that you have
these three factors.

2
00:00:03,018 --> 00:00:06,840
Portfolio return,
risk-free rate of return, and

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:12,160
standard deviation of portfolio return,
or volatility, or risk.

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:16,440
How would you combine these three
factors into a simple equation

5
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:21,130
to create a metric that provides
a measure of risk adjusted return?

6
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:27,400
In other words, like those examples we
showed you before, all else being equal,

7
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:31,990
higher return is better, all else being
equal, lower volatility is better.

8
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:34,910
Which of these three do you
think is the best metric?
