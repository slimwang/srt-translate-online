This line y equals, that our curve heads towards, but never quite reaches as x

2
00:00:03,828 --> 00:00:07,362
goes to positive infinity and to negative infinity is called a horizontal

3
00:00:07,362 --> 00:00:12,040
asymptote. Let's look at another rational function and see if we can find its

4
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:15,386
horizontal asymptote. In fact, why don't we return to that other function we

5
00:00:15,386 --> 00:00:21,692
were working with before. f of x equals 1 over 3x. What is its horizontal

6
00:00:21,692 --> 00:00:25,380
asymptote? Make sure that the answer you give is the equation of a horizontal

7
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:26,340
line.
