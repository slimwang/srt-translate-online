1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:04,260
So when solving radical equations, sometimes we'll get a quadratic with two

2
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:09,532
potential solutions. But we need to check these solutions in order to determine

3
00:00:09,532 --> 00:00:15,088
which ones actually satisfy the original equation. In this case, negative 1 did

4
00:00:15,088 --> 00:00:21,334
not check, so our only solution for this original radical equation is 5. This

5
00:00:21,334 --> 00:00:22,620
is our solution set.
