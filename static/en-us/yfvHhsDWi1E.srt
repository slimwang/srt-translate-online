When finding the LCD we want to look at the denominators of all of our

2
00:00:03,802 --> 00:00:10,666
fractions. So that would be x, 2 and 2x. Since x is a factor of 2x and 2 is a

3
00:00:10,666 --> 00:00:16,740
factor of 2x we really just want this as our LCD. We want to take the product of

4
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:21,550
all of the different factors And their highest powers of any denominator. Great

00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:23,234
thinking if you got 2x.
