00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,910
Let's use our order of operations to help us solve this problem. We should solve

2
00:00:03,922 --> 00:00:07,716
this problem going from left to right following the hierarchy of the order of

3
00:00:07,728 --> 00:00:11,526
operations. Parenthesis and brackets serve as containers, and this should be

4
00:00:11,538 --> 00:00:15,361
evaluated before we do any operations onto them. Brackets are typically used

5
00:00:15,373 --> 00:00:18,884
only if they have parenthesis inside them, but we evaluate them the same way. We

6
00:00:18,884 --> 00:00:22,508
start at the very inside and they work a way out. I'm going to simplify this

7
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:27,320
negative of 5 squared. I know this 5 squared only goes with the power, so I have

8
00:00:27,332 --> 00:00:31,878
25 or negative 25. Now, I simplify this parenthesis, and then I add negative 20

9
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:36,263
to 3. I lose my brackets because I no longer have parenthesis. I just have

10
00:00:36,275 --> 00:00:40,994
negative 17, so I write that in parenthesis. I can't simplify this parenthesis

11
00:00:41,006 --> 00:00:45,602
anymore, so now I should go back and do my order of operations. Let's look for

12
00:00:45,614 --> 00:00:50,721
powers. I have powers here and here, so I should simplify these numbers. I want

13
00:00:50,363 --> 00:00:55,148
to be very careful. I have the negative of 3 squared, and the negative of 2

14
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:59,117
squared. I only square the 3 and I only square the 2. So, I have negative 9,

15
00:00:59,223 --> 00:01:02,409
negative 17, and negative 4. Adding the opposite is the same thing as

16
00:01:02,421 --> 00:01:06,742
subtraction, that's why I can write negative 17. Finally, I can add all these

17
00:01:06,754 --> 00:01:11,307
negative numbers up, and I'll get my final answer. And I get negative 30. You

18
00:01:11,319 --> 00:01:15,114
can think of doing parentheses and brackets first. We don't include them in our

19
00:01:15,126 --> 00:01:19,027
order of operations because, well, they're not actually operations. They're just

20
00:01:19,039 --> 00:01:19,572
containers.
