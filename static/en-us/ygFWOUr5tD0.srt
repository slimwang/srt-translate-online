1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,929
To send Marla's record to Dr. Jones, Dr.

2
00:00:04,929 --> 00:00:11,278
Johnson uses the direct service
provided by his state HIE.

3
00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:17,420
This simplified and somewhat futuristic
diagram explains how that could work.

4
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:20,220
Here Marla's record has a share button.

5
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:24,670
That's not quite available yet but some
EMR vendors are working on integrating

6
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:28,110
direct into their workflow so
it may appear in the future.

7
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:30,180
Doctor Johnson clicks it and

8
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:34,320
selects Doctor Jones from
a list of his usual referrals.

9
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,180
If needed he could could look up a new
physician in a directory provided by

10
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:44,190
the direct server called a Health ISP or
HISP.

11
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:47,620
Here, for simplicity,
we're assuming that Doctor Johnson and

12
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:50,320
Doctor Jones are using the same HISP.

13
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,480
Before physicians are listed,
their identities and

14
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:59,780
qualifications are verified, and they're
assigned a special direct email address.

15
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:01,970
This establishes trust so Dr.

16
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:06,130
Johnson knows the email
will only go to Dr. Jones.

17
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:11,140
The form of the record can be
whatever Dr. Johnson chooses.

18
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:13,576
It could be a scan of a paper record or

19
00:01:13,576 --> 00:01:19,840
it could be a special XML formatted
patient summary specified under VDT.

20
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:24,610
In any case, the record is encrypted and
attached to a secure email.

21
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:29,160
This establishes security so the
information can't be viewed in transit,

22
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:32,280
a key requirement for
health information exchange.

23
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:36,600
Privacy was taken care of when Marla
consented to sharing of her record

24
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,230
with other physicians
involved in her care.

25
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:42,990
If you've ever signed a HIPAA release
in your doctor's waiting room,

26
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:44,467
you agreed to this.

27
00:01:44,467 --> 00:01:48,667
Dr. Jones gets the email
in her direct inbox and

28
00:01:48,667 --> 00:01:53,746
can review the record if it's a PDF or
paper scan.

29
00:01:53,746 --> 00:01:58,470
If it is in a special XML format called
a Continuity of Care Document or

30
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:01,730
CCD, the record could be parsed and

31
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:07,216
put right into Marla's chart in Dr.
Jones's office as shown here.

32
00:02:07,216 --> 00:02:10,410
Parsing it and merging it into
an existing record is yet

33
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:13,620
another futuristic
component of this diagram.

34
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,260
Note that the encryption and

35
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:21,120
decryption of Marla's record is
done using public key encryption.

36
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,470
We'll look at how that
works in lesson four.
