00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,540
We've gone over some examples for
monetizing using ads on both the web and

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:06,650
on native devices.

3
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:10,150
Now implementation for the other methods
are actually pretty similar, right?

4
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:11,160
>> That's right.

5
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:14,830
For all other methods, one-time charge,
in-app payment, subscriptions, and

6
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:18,860
others, you really just need
to set up your payment system.

7
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:22,993
Whether you choose Braintree,
Stripe, PayPal, Google Pay or Apple,

8
00:00:22,993 --> 00:00:24,086
doesn't matter.

9
00:00:24,086 --> 00:00:27,870
It's best follow the instructions
on each of their sites.

10
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:31,084
>> We've included links to each of
these in the instructor notes below.

11
00:00:31,084 --> 00:00:34,069
After you've set up your payment method,
it's time to set prices and

12
00:00:34,069 --> 00:00:35,090
monitor performance.
