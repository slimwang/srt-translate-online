00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:01,200
Welcome back!

2
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:05,230
In the previous lessons,
you deploy your own Hadoop clusters.

3
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:09,570
A long running cluster is great when you
have many jobs and it's in constant use.

4
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:12,610
However, for many cases, you won't
need a full cluster all the time.

5
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:13,730
It will just be sitting there idle.

6
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,040
Amazon EC2 instances are charged hourly,
so

7
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:20,710
if your cluster is idle,
you're wasting money.

8
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:23,776
A better option is to deploy a cluster
only when you have jobs to run.

9
00:00:23,776 --> 00:00:26,040
When the the tasks are done,

10
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:28,260
you can shut down the cluster until
the next time you have a job.

11
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:32,840
Maintaining the cluster also takes
time away from other projects.

12
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:36,070
For a small organization there might not
be enough people to spend time worrying

13
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:36,730
about a cluster.

14
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:41,440
To solve these problems,
you can use an on-demand Hadoop cluster.

15
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:42,460
Let's look at some options.
