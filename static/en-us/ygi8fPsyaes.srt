00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:03,020
Let's start with a table view
from the iOS Health app.

2
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:05,080
Here's the table for Health Data.

3
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:06,730
If we dissect the content view for

4
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:11,610
each cell, we see a UI ImageView,
a UI Label, and another UI ImageView.

5
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:15,410
Here in the Maps app,
you can see that as I type,

6
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:17,840
the table is rapidly being repopulated.

7
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,670
But, the components of the small views,
the magnifying glass icon,

8
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:24,740
the placement of the text,
those are repeating.

9
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:28,890
In both Health Kit and Maps, you see
an image here on the left margin.

10
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:31,400
And, you see the same
font in the text field.

11
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:34,430
These top views are instances
of the same view class.

12
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:36,500
The Search bar is a stock
view that we're going to use,

13
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:37,860
as well, in our practice apps.

14
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:41,240
If I return to the map of San Francisco,
and

15
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:45,710
drop a pin on Golden Gate Park, clicking
that pin gives me another table view.

16
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:50,570
Here the cell separators are similar
to the ones we just saw.

17
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:54,030
But, there are no image views,
and each cell contains a button.

18
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:57,690
Here in my contacts, the table cell
views are separated into sections.

19
00:00:57,690 --> 00:00:59,950
But, in this lesson, we're just
going to stick to one section.

20
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:04,565
Here, in the albums table of the photos
app, we see a similar structure.

21
00:01:04,565 --> 00:01:07,323
But, the smaller views
are formatted a little differently.

22
00:01:07,323 --> 00:01:12,695
The image views are larger, and we see
two labels with custom font sizes.

23
00:01:12,695 --> 00:01:16,355
Stop for a moment, and think about
which of the pixels on this screen

24
00:01:16,355 --> 00:01:19,615
are actually drawn for
the table view, per say.

25
00:01:19,615 --> 00:01:23,540
Because, the screen is filled up
with these smaller repeating views,

26
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:27,430
the pixels that are being drawn
are contained in the smaller views.

27
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:29,840
These small repeating
views are called cells,

28
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,920
they're subclasses of UI TableViewCell,
which is a UI view.

29
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,540
Tables tile the cell views
vertically and draw in separators.

30
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:41,636
Think about the different tables and
their similarities.

31
00:01:41,636 --> 00:01:44,590
What kind of data is necessary
to populate a table?
