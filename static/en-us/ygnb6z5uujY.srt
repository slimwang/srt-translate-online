00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,490
The only way to not go crazy
trying to handle responsive images

2
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:07,880
is to set up an image pipeline
that makes it easy for

3
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:11,720
you to create multiple versions
of your images automatically.

4
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:14,870
And to do that you're going to
need the right software.

5
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:18,050
For your own sanity,
I want you to take a step back and

6
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:22,160
install Grunt, ImageOptim,
and ImageMagick.

7
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,030
Seriously, Grunt is super useful.

8
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:28,360
I use it all the time to
automate tasks for my projects.

9
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:31,920
ImageOptim and ImageMagick are also
awesome, because it makes it so

10
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,820
easy to convert images to different
sizes, formats, and compression levels.

11
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:39,220
You're going to want their help when
you start working on the project for

12
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:41,980
this course and in your future projects.

13
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:45,310
You'll find links in the instructor
notes for some how-to guides.

14
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:47,780
Once you've got everything installed,
check this box to continue.
