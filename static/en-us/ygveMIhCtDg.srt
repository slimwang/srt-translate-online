1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:01,740
So let's practice this a little bit.

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:05,740
So here's a data set that is clearly not linearly separable.

3
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:11,120
So you won't be able to find a line that separates the x's from the circles,

4
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,050
within the xy coordinate system.

5
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:15,820
But now I'm going to ask you to add one more feature.

6
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:18,040
And that feature should make it linearly separable.

7
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:19,770
And I'll give you some.

8
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:23,240
Possibilities x square plus y square,

9
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:27,800
as before, the absolute value of x or the absolute value of y.

10
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:31,260
Obviously, the absolute value just takes out the minus sign.

11
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:32,130
Take one of those.

12
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:35,510
I can tell you one of those actually makes linearly separable.

13
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:39,962
And it's a trick question, it's hard.
