1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:05,196
So the first rule in our Pythonista's Guide to solving all problems in the known

2
00:00:05,196 --> 00:00:10,270
computational galaxy is to always ask, what are the inputs? Now, there is one

3
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:15,905
rule before the first rule, that's the zeroth rule. And the zeroth rule is don't

4
00:00:15,905 --> 00:00:19,598
panic. If you panic, you're never going to solve the problem. But the first

5
00:00:19,598 --> 00:00:22,253
substantial rule is to figure out what the inputs are.
