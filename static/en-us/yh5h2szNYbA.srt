1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The answer is, yes, but it doesn't provide much advantage,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
since now an attacker who learns the hash of p doesn't need to learn p.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The first statement is not true.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
If there was some dictionary attack using the password,

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
it'd work just as well using the hash of the password.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
The third one is also not true.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
The server doesn't need to invert the hash, and a shared key can be established

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
just like before.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
The fourth is not true.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
If there was a serious security vulnerability in this protocol,

11
00:00:27,000 --> 99:59:59,999
It would exist in the original protocol as well.
