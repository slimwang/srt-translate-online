1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,718
Only these two graph parabolas. Which might surprise you. In particular, this

2
00:00:05,718 --> 00:00:11,073
equation, y equals x squared plus 2 xy plus 1 does not graph a parabola. Even

3
00:00:11,073 --> 00:00:16,383
though there is a x squared term, there's also this term 2 xy. Looking back at

4
00:00:16,383 --> 00:00:20,403
the general form, we don't see any terms here that have both x and y in them

5
00:00:20,403 --> 00:00:24,756
multiplied together, so this does not fit the bill. We'll see this graph in just

6
00:00:24,756 --> 00:00:29,000
a second. And, of course, you'll recognize this graph as a straight line. This

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,330
is linear. Think to yourself what the slope is and what the y-coordinate or the

8
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:37,897
y-intercept is. This last answer may also have been a little bit tricky for you.

9
00:00:37,897 --> 00:00:41,897
I know that right now this doesn't look at all, like this general form equation

10
00:00:41,897 --> 00:00:45,936
of a parabola. But if we distributed multiplication by what's in this first set

11
00:00:45,936 --> 00:00:50,136
of parenthesis towards on the second one, we get something pretty interesting.

12
00:00:50,136 --> 00:00:53,715
In fact, let's look at the graphs for all four of these right now. So here are

13
00:00:53,715 --> 00:00:57,589
the graphs for all 4 of the equations we just looked at. This funny red curve,

14
00:00:57,589 --> 00:01:01,070
which has a big break in the middle, is the graph that corresponds to the

15
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:04,997
equation that we've never seen anything like before. Y equals x squared plus 2

16
00:01:04,997 --> 00:01:08,431
xy plus 1. How funny that this isn't even in one piece. This is called a

17
00:01:08,431 --> 00:01:12,341
hyperbola. We're not really going to deal with them much. But it's important to

18
00:01:12,341 --> 00:01:16,053
recognize that having a term like xy makes an equation no longer equation of a

19
00:01:16,053 --> 00:01:19,882
parabola. This solitary straight line is of course y equals 5 x plus 7. The

20
00:01:19,882 --> 00:01:25,014
yellow curve, is the parabola y equals 3 x squared plus 2 x. And this last curve

21
00:01:25,014 --> 00:01:29,955
left, this big blue arc, is y equals negative 1 8th, x minus 4, times x minus

22
00:01:29,955 --> 00:01:35,317
24. Because if you multiplied out all of the terms inside here, we'd end up with

23
00:01:35,317 --> 00:01:40,084
a term with an x squared in it, as the only term of degree 2. And it does,

24
00:01:40,084 --> 00:01:41,858
indeed, graph a parabola.
