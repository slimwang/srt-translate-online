1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,330
Now we need to figure out how to use computed observables to

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:05,420
add functionality to our application.

3
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:09,510
Specifically, to add a cat name feature and a cat title feature.

4
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:11,120
In order to learn how to use them,

5
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,450
we'll take a look at the documentation together.

6
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:18,150
Now first off, every librarian framework has its own documentation and

7
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:21,970
libraries without documentation are not very effective to use.

8
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:24,200
So, if documentation is missing or

9
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:29,000
especially poor, nobody will want to use the library, and it won't take off.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,350
Chances are if you've heard of a library before,

11
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:33,550
it probably has pretty good documentation.

12
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:38,120
Now Knockouts documentation, is actually more of a series of articles here,

13
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:40,860
rather than a traditional documentation site.

14
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:44,960
That's okay though because most of the information we need is here.

15
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,200
If you find the documentation lacking there is probably a blog post by

16
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:51,370
someone else illuminating the thing you're looking for and

17
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:54,570
to figure that part out I usually start with a Google search.

18
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:57,440
Now let's take a look at computed observables.

19
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:02,190
Now Knockout's documentation gives us a pretty good first explanation here,

20
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:05,370
introducing the concept of computed observables.

21
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:08,390
In this case, they're saying if we have a firsName and

22
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:14,010
a lastName, both observables, Bob Smith, how do we get the fullName?

23
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:19,650
Well rather than putting the joining logic Bob plus space plus Smith.

24
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:23,880
Everywhere, all over the place, instead we can define a computed observable.

25
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:27,090
Computed observables are awesome, and

26
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:29,130
they're pretty simple to implement in Knockout.

27
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:31,340
All you have to do,

28
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:36,550
is run ko.computed(), passing in the function that computes what you want.

29
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:39,160
And an optional suggested argument for

30
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:43,290
the thing that maps to the this keyword inside that function.

31
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:48,270
Basically, because of the way ko dot computed works, when we pass in this for

32
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:49,540
the second argument,

33
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:53,590
that ensures that we can use the this keyword inside the function.

34
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:56,400
And this means that we can use our other observables,

35
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:59,870
because we have access to the this that they're on.

36
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:05,180
So again, in summary, this.fullname equals ko.computed, and then a function

37
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:11,370
which simply returns firstName added to space, and then added to lastName.

38
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:15,569
Now we can use it like any other variable, this.fullName pretty cool.
