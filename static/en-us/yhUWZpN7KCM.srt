00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:02,070
Okay, the time has come to wrap up

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:05,560
transactions where we will cover transaction rules. And the

3
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:07,910
two things we will start with are snapshot

4
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:13,050
isolation which defines the read consistency and optimistic concurrency

5
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:16,210
which governs concurrent updates. We'll start off with

6
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:20,070
snapshot isolation. And please observe that this behavior may

7
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:22,570
differ between languages, so be sure to check out

8
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:25,480
the documentation. The first rule is that all read

9
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:29,040
operations in a transaction will return the values datastore

10
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:32,280
had when the transaction started. And the second rule

11
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:35,960
for snapshot isolation is. Updates will not be reflected

12
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:39,070
while in the transaction. So, if an entity is modified

13
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:41,780
or deleted in the transaction, a query will get

14
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:44,750
the original version of the entity, or nothing if

15
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:48,300
the entity did not exit then. That's snapshot isolation,

16
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,920
but please be sure to check out the documentation as

17
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:54,360
this behavior is somewhat language specific. So let's

18
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:57,880
turn to optimistic concurrency. This rule is that a

19
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:00,990
commit transaction would only be successful if the

20
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:04,810
values updated by this transaction have not changed since

21
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:07,650
the begin transaction. If the values that you're

22
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:11,030
trying to update has changed since begin, the transaction

23
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:13,460
will fail. Then there are two additional rules

24
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:15,990
you should be aware of. The first is that

25
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:18,750
one transaction can modify at most five ancestor

26
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:21,590
groups. The second rule is that a transaction

27
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:24,680
must complete within 60 seconds, but the general

28
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,710
rule is, of course, to keep the execution

29
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:30,200
of transactions short. As short as possible, unless

30
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,840
in extremely rare cases, they should be finished

31
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,740
within a couple of seconds and in most

32
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:38,050
cases, less than a second. That completes this section
