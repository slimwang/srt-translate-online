00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:05,320
Typically, the modules in a system are responsible for maintaining invariants.

2
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:08,394
That is, they have to make sure they are in a consistent state before and

3
00:00:08,394 --> 00:00:10,352
after executing each service they provide.

4
00:00:10,352 --> 00:00:14,726
The same holds true for components, which are just third-party modules.

5
00:00:14,726 --> 00:00:18,016
However, the presence of callbacks makes invariant maintenance much

6
00:00:18,016 --> 00:00:18,848
more difficult.

7
00:00:18,848 --> 00:00:22,816
In particular, during the time when the client is handling the callback request,

8
00:00:22,816 --> 00:00:24,880
the component is vulnerable.

9
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,940
Because it has given up control to the client,

10
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:30,010
there's a danger that the client may do something that breaks the invariant,

11
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:31,460
like make another call to the component.
