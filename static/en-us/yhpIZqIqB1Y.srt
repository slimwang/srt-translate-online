1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The first thing we did in order to model the zigzagging oscillation of the brake pressure

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
was to create this perimeter called brake change.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Just for simplicity,we set the initial value of brake change to zero.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
If you move down to the far loop, you can see that brake change

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
alternates between having a value of 1 and -1.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
If the wheel slip falls below the constant low slip, then the brake change value switches to 1.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
And as soon as the wheel slip passes high slip, they change, switches signs, and becomes -1.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
An expression for b after the next times step

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
We've ensure that b will not drop below zero

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
by setting zero as the minimum value that it can take on.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Then using this min method right here, we are assuring

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
that its magnitude will not exceed max brake.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
However, anywhere in between zero and max brake, it will take on this value right here.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
We take the value of b at the previous step and add it to the step size times brake change,

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
which is either you're going to make this a positive or negative quantity

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
and multiply that by the hydraulics speed.

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Remember that hydraulic speed is just the rate of change of the strength of the brake.

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
To visualize what we've done, let's look at our plots.

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
This bottom graph shows how the brake strength changes with time.

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Just as we hoped, we see that our line either has a negative slope or a positive slope,

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
but of the same magnitude just alternating signs.

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
These changes in sign correspond to the flip in the sign of brake change.

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The crest of the brake strength curve are points at which brake change

24
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
switches from being positive to being negative.

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
We see that the brake change switches to -1 if the wheel slip exceeds the value of high slip

26
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
and if you look at the corresponding values in wheel slip, you see that these points of transition

27
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
in brake strength corresponds to the highest values in wheel slip

28
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
and the lowest value in wheel slip which we can see signals a switch in brake change to +1

29
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
correspond to a change in the sign of the slope of brake strength from negative to positive.

30
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Zooming out and looking at these plots as a whole, they say that the wheel slip is controlled very nicely

31
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
but the value of b does oscillate very strongly

32
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
and this would look pretty stressful for the brake mechanism.

33
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
What we would want instead would be a value of b that will be close to the correct value.

34
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
One option for this would be to limit the range of b by holding the pressure constant

35
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
or keeping the value of b constant then b gets either too large or too small.

36
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Let's try that out by making a small change in our code for just a second

37
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I'm going to comment out this line and instead infinite this line.

38
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Our original line of code kept the value of b between 0 and max brake.

39
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
We are now going to replace those respectively with 100 and 150

40
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
so b is going to be within a much smaller range of values.

41
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Now, let's see what happens with this change.

42
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
The first thing that I noticed when I looked at this is that as you would expect

43
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
the graph of the brake strength, it doesn't look like it will

44
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
put much strain and stress in the braking system as our previous system did.

45
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
The wheel slip also still stays within a very nice range and their car does come to a complete stop.

46
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Despite the improvement that this would allow, it will require some additional knowledge

47
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
that may be difficult to find.

48
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
We have to be able to project a reasonable range for b depending on current road conditions

49
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
and we also have to measure the hydraulic pressure of the brake.

50
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
There are cheaper options that we could consider such as looking at the deceleration of the wheel

51
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,000
to decide when to stop increasing or decreasing the pressure and to hold the pressure constant instead.

52
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I hoped you enjoyed this brief introduction into the intricacies of actuators with the speed dynamics.

53
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Unfortunately, this is the end of our work for now with cars and braking systems.

54
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
We're moving on to something very exciting, wild fires.

55
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I know that playing with fire is risky, but luckily we are doing all that on computers

56
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
so we don't really have much to worry about.

57
00:03:22,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Get ready for some very interesting problems and great job on this unit.
