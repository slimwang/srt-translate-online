00:00:09,064 --> 00:00:13,744
do print, what we'll get is a nice useful printed message that gives us the name

4
00:00:13,744 --> 00:00:18,554
of the restaurant, the owner, and the chef. And you can see that all that's

00:00:18,554 --> 00:00:24,174
happening there is it's printing out the result of the str [unknown] method.
