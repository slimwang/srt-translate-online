1
00:00:00,167 --> 00:00:06,699
So now we have factor two approximation algorithms for Alice, who is, of course, very happy about this.

2
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:11,466
And we've also found a factor two approximation algorithm for the problem that Dave was working on.

3
00:00:11,467 --> 00:00:16,566
So Dave is, of course, equally happy. Now, the question: Since Alice and Dave apparently are working on problems

4
00:00:16,567 --> 00:00:20,232
that can be approximated very well, what about Bob and Carol?

5
00:00:20,233 --> 00:00:26,466
And as you remember, the problems that Bob and Carol are working on are closely related to the one that Alice was working on.

6
00:00:26,467 --> 00:00:33,299
So, Alice was working on Vertex Cover, Bob was working, as you'll remember, on Clique, and Carol was working on Independent Set.

7
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:37,566
So we already know that we have a factor two approximation algorithm for Vertex Cover.

8
00:00:37,567 --> 00:00:41,932
And from the previous units, you also know how closely Vertex Cover is related to,

9
00:00:41,933 --> 00:00:48,266
well, first of all, Independent Set, but also Clique. Given the close relation, we take this algorithm here and simply

10
00:00:48,267 --> 00:00:51,666
carry over our insight for Vertex Cover to Clique and Independent Set.

11
00:00:51,667 --> 00:00:56,399
So the question now is, given this factor two approximation for Vertex Cover, and given the close relation

12
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:01,366
of Vertex Cover to Clique and Independent Set, do we now also know that there's a factor two approximation for

13
00:01:01,367 --> 00:01:06,300
Clique and Independent Set? And I'm just writing Independent Set as IS here, to save some space.
