00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:02,440
When you unzipped that zipped file,

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:06,100
did you notice that zip prints out
all the things it's extracting?

3
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:09,270
Let's take another look at
the output of the unzip command.

4
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:10,650
Scroll up through it.

5
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:12,290
Oh, hey look at this.

6
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:18,300
One of the files that it extracted is
called .secret, starting with a dot.

7
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:22,021
But when we ran ls we
don't see that file.

8
00:00:22,021 --> 00:00:27,245
In fact, ls by default doesn't list any
files whose names start with a dot.

9
00:00:27,245 --> 00:00:30,511
This is because files with names
starting with dot are often used on

10
00:00:30,511 --> 00:00:31,562
Linux for caching and

11
00:00:31,562 --> 00:00:35,570
configuration and other things that
you don't normally care about.

12
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:39,108
So the shell will hide them by default
because they're not usually interesting.

13
00:00:39,108 --> 00:00:42,760
But there is an option to ls
to make it display them too.

14
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:46,090
To find out,
look in the manual page for ls.

15
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:48,280
It may take some searching around.

16
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:52,570
So using the manual, find out how you
can list all the items in a directory,

17
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:55,110
including the ones whose
names start with dot.

18
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:56,420
Put the command you found here.
