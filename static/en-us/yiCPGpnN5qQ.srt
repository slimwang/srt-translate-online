00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:01,580
So, now that we have seen how the

2
00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:04,190
conditional MOV instructions work, let's do a quiz

3
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:09,620
about how to use them. Let's say that the code we have is this. If R1

4
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:15,483
is zero, we branch here and increment R3. Otherwise,

5
00:00:15,483 --> 00:00:20,505
we stay here and increment R2, and then either way, we go to the

6
00:00:20,505 --> 00:00:26,330
end. After if conversion, we will have something like add

7
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:31,242
one to R2 and put the result in R4. Add 1 to R3 and put the

8
00:00:31,242 --> 00:00:34,762
result in R5, followed by what instruction in

9
00:00:34,762 --> 00:00:38,750
order to properly make this equivalent to this code.
