1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:05,840
In this lesson, we have discussed VLIW processors, and their itanium cousins.

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:09,650
We have learned the pros and cons of these processors, and

3
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:15,970
also some of the reasons for the itaniums high expectations and eventual demise.

4
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:19,980
This lesson concludes the first part of my high-performance computer

5
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:24,510
architecture course, where we have learned how the modern processor core works.

6
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:29,380
In the next part of the course, we will learn how to get good performance even

7
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:34,670
though the main memory is really slow, and way too small to fit the programs we

8
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:40,250
want to run. After that, the final part of the course is about putting multiple

9
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:45,220
processor cores together to get even more performance and energy efficiency.
