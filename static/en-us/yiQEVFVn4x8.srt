1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,899
Okay so, we've looked at the CSS, we've looked at the HTML files.

2
00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:04,520
>> Mm-hm.

3
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:07,316
>> But there's a lot more going on in here. So how,

4
00:00:07,316 --> 00:00:11,350
I mean, how do you think about approaching a new program like this?

5
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:12,520
>> Well, so there's always going to be some

6
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:15,640
files, these guys that have a point of

7
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:18,090
for, of being there but they aren't really

8
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:21,320
essential to understanding the functionality of the program.

9
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:21,580
>> Okay.

10
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:25,660
>> So, I sort of ignore those guys and go straight for the,

11
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:27,520
you know, the things that really change

12
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:30,880
how the program looks and how it operates.

13
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:31,410
>> Okay.

14
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:36,130
>> So, if we look here in the JavaScript, we'll see a bunch of, a bunch of files

15
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:38,480
including some that are, you know, sort of less

16
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,030
useful when it comes to understanding how the programs works.

17
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:44,250
>> Okay. So like, here we are in the

18
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:48,306
JavaScript file we have here. Add in frame, underscore poly-fill.

19
00:00:48,306 --> 00:00:50,730
>> Okay, so this, this guy isn't really going to give

20
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:55,880
you a lot of information about how the game functions.

21
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,400
>> How do you know that?

22
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:01,600
>> You can just sort of look. There's not really a lot happening here that has

23
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,980
to do with, like, the tiles on the,

24
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:06,820
on the page moving around or anything like that.

25
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:11,050
It's just sort of something you have to get a feel for. So this, this guy

26
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:13,200
seems to be doing something, it's creating a

27
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,770
game manager, which sounds like something to do with

28
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:18,710
the game. So that's probably defined in here.

29
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:19,840
>> Okay, and looks like it is.

30
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:25,790
>> And it looks like this guy has a lot of functions that do

31
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:29,055
stuff with the game. So this, this is probably a good place to start looking.

32
00:01:29,055 --> 00:01:29,220
>> Okay.

33
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:31,660
>> At what the overall structure of the program looks like.

34
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:33,090
>> And then just keep going from

35
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:35,640
there until you're satisfied that you understand

36
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,600
things? Okay, so I know you took some time to make a pretty thing.

37
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:44,100
I want to pull it up. I'm lying. This is my handwriting. I

38
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:46,920
did it for you, sorry. [LAUGH] But these are the big, these are

39
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:49,450
the big files that you were, the most important in terms of

40
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:54,190
function of the game. The index, the main file, the whole JavaScript folder.

41
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:56,210
>> With a couple of exceptions. Yeah.

42
00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:57,550
>> Things that weren't quite as important.

43
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:59,020
>> The poly fill functions

44
00:01:59,020 --> 00:01:59,490
>> Mm-hm.

45
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:03,580
>> Or files especially. And then these seven, these seven files so if, if

46
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:06,770
you were going to do, I am sorry these seven JavaScript files, yeah. So if

47
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:10,030
we were going to add an Undo button, I mean,

48
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:11,744
where is the majority of the work going to take place?

49
00:02:11,744 --> 00:02:14,176
Would it be in the Index, would it be in

50
00:02:14,176 --> 00:02:18,270
the Main, or would it be somewhere in these JavaScript files?
