00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:05,190
So let's talk about how to actually
create a surface with the Android STK.

2
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:09,850
So, as we said, a surface is essentially
a container which casts a shadow.

3
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:13,600
We can identify which views in
our hierarchy are surfaces and

4
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:16,900
set appropriate backgrounds and
elevation values.

5
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:18,610
So let's start with a simple example and

6
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:23,030
create a screen that contains
a single surface that casts a shadow.

7
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:28,530
So here I am in Android Studio looking
at a simple activity layout file.

8
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:31,800
I have a frame layout
which will be our surface.

9
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,250
I can give it a height and
width and some margins and

10
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:37,480
set its background here to white.

11
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:43,440
To create a surface, the key thing is
I can set this elevation value here.

12
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,900
Here I'm setting 4dp, and Android
will render that as a shadow for us.

13
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:52,030
The elevation is the distance of
surfaces above the back plane.

14
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:53,900
Higher values produce larger shadows.

15
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:57,200
So here we are running this on a device.

16
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:01,530
And as you can see,
our frame layout is casting a shadow

17
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:04,420
along the bottom edge onto
the background behind.

18
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:07,360
This clearly shows that
it's a separate surface.

19
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:12,310
Back in Android Studio, I can duplicate
our surface a couple of times,

20
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:13,850
so the same frame layout.

21
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:17,300
But here, I'm setting different
values for the elevation.

22
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:21,510
So we have one set with 4 dp,
a second set is at 8 dp,

23
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:24,440
and a third at 16 dp in
front of the back plane.

24
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,030
Running this,

25
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:30,430
we see that Android renders these three
different surfaces of different shadows.

26
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:35,740
So here's a subtle shadow, a little more
noticeable, and more noticeable still.

27
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:39,620
The higher the elevation values produce
a larger more diffuse shadow giving

28
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:43,270
the appearance of being higher up or
further in front of the back plane.
