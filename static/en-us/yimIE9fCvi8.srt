00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Let's go further, and let's now take this function and multiply it by -Â½.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Again, I ask you what the affect it.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
If this is your original quadratic, then what do we get?

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
We already know that it's going to flatten it, because you are dividing the f value by half,

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
but are we going to get something like this or perhaps something like this?

6
00:00:17,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Pick one of those two choices.
