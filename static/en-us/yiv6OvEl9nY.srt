If you're familiar with the relational databases,

2
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:07,900
you may have come across the idea, of integrity constraints. And can, integrity

3
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:13,260
constraints are just another name for invariants. For example, in a database,

4
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:18,260
you wouldn't want to have a record for a, a person saying that they work for

5
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:20,600
a company, and that company has gone bankrupt and

6
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:24,880
is no longer in the database. In programming terms that's a dangling pointer.

7
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,900
You want to make sure that your database or your system, never gets in

8
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:34,550
situations where there's those. There are those kinds of integrity violations.
