00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:03,430
In the last lecture we spent a lot of
time looking at how we're going to

2
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:06,980
reliably find corners in multiple
images that'll allow us to do

3
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:07,960
feature detection.

4
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:12,170
We also introduced the concept of
SIFT and Harris detection algorithms.

5
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:14,220
In this lecture I want to
actually dive deeper.

6
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:17,350
Try to get to understanding
of how does SIFT, and

7
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:20,820
also Harris detector algorithms work,
and how are they actually made,

8
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:23,370
both illumination scale and
rotation invariant?
