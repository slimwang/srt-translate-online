1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,879
Ok this is the same code we saw just before

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:04,889
This is from a completed version

3
00:00:04,889 --> 00:00:07,049
of Pitch Perfect, so don't worry if your

4
00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:09,240
code doesn't match this quite yet. We'll

5
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:11,429
get there. Let's dive a little deeper and

6
00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:14,339
confirm what each line of code is doing.

7
00:00:14,339 --> 00:00:16,949
First we have the import AVFoundation statement.

8
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:19,050
The AVFoundation framework

9
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:22,050
contains the AVAudioRecorder.

10
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:24,118
And without this import statement, Xcode

11
00:00:24,118 --> 00:00:25,559
wouldn't know about any of the AVFoundation

12
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:27,750
classes and our code wouldn't compile.

13
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:30,989
Then we have this audio recorder

14
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:33,780
property which is declared. This property

15
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:35,850
gives this View Controller the ability

16
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:37,950
to use and reference the audioRecorder

17
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:40,770
in multiple places. This is really useful,

18
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:42,479
because we want to reference the audioRecorder

19
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:45,390
in different functions.

20
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:47,070
One for beginning recording and one when we're

21
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:49,920
stopping recording. Next we have the

22
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,530
function recordAudio. The first line

23
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:54,299
that I have highlighted is used to get

24
00:00:54,299 --> 00:00:55,770
the directory path.

25
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:58,109
Specifically, this line of code grabs the

26
00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:00,090
application’s documentDirectory and

27
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:02,460
stores it as a string in this dirPath constant.

28
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:05,010
Later in the Nanodegree, you’ll

29
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:06,659
learn about other directories and

30
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:09,989
storage locations available for iOS.

31
00:01:09,989 --> 00:01:11,938
For this example, it just needs a place to

32
00:01:11,938 --> 00:01:13,650
store the audio recording and the

33
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:15,629
documents directory will work fine.

34
00:01:15,629 --> 00:01:17,938
The directory path then gets combined

35
00:01:17,938 --> 00:01:19,290
with the filename for the recording

36
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:22,650
called recordedVoice.wav.

37
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:24,030
These two lines are the lines that actually

38
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:26,368
combine both the directory path and the

39
00:01:26,368 --> 00:01:28,349
recording name to create a full path to

40
00:01:28,349 --> 00:01:29,099
our file.

41
00:01:29,099 --> 00:01:32,009
Next up an audio session is setup using

42
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:35,609
the AVAudioSession.sharedInstance.

43
00:01:35,609 --> 00:01:37,379
If we hold down the option key and click

44
00:01:37,379 --> 00:01:40,109
session, we can see its type. We see that

45
00:01:40,109 --> 00:01:43,680
it is indeed a AVAudioSession.

46
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,299
A AVAudioSession is what is needed to

47
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:48,688
either record or playback audio.

48
00:01:48,688 --> 00:01:50,938
And the sharedInstance that we access here is a

49
00:01:50,938 --> 00:01:52,469
AVAudioSession that's already

50
00:01:52,469 --> 00:01:54,328
created by default once our app starts

51
00:01:54,328 --> 00:01:56,099
running, and it can be used with a

52
00:01:56,099 --> 00:01:58,618
minimal amount of setup. Going a bit

53
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:01,049
further, the AVAudioSession class is

54
00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:03,239
basically an abstraction of the entire

55
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:06,149
Audio Hardware. Since there's only one

56
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:08,098
Audio Hardware for device there's only

57
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:11,370
one instance of AVAudioSession.

58
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:13,169
Hence this is why we use the

59
00:02:13,169 --> 00:02:13,560
sharedInstance

60
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,169
It’s the shared AVAudioSession across all

61
00:02:16,169 --> 00:02:19,379
apps on our device. This idea of a shared

62
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:21,150
instance is a very common pattern that

63
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:22,500
you're going to see a lot as you're

64
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,379
working with Apple frameworks. This next

65
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:27,150
line of code sets up the session for

66
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:30,150
playing and recording audio. This line of

67
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,459
code is part of a try statement. The try

68
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:35,280
statement uses an ! which indicates that

69
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,139
it doesn't handle any errors if this

70
00:02:37,139 --> 00:02:40,199
line of code fails. The same is true of

71
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:42,389
this line where we're creating

72
00:02:42,389 --> 00:02:44,219
a AVAudioRecorder. We're going to cover

73
00:02:44,219 --> 00:02:46,318
error handling later, but for now we can

74
00:02:46,318 --> 00:02:49,349
just assume both these lines work. With a

75
00:02:49,349 --> 00:02:51,930
AVAudioRecorder created, then we set

76
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:54,120
its isMeteringEnabled property to true,

77
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:57,030
we prepare to record and then we record.

78
00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:03,530
And that's it.
