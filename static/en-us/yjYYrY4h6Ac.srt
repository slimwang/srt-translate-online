1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:03,210
Okay, so let's look at the solution.

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:07,001
First of all, you can see that I
created a ToastAdListener class here.

3
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:09,622
And if we open up this file,

4
00:00:09,622 --> 00:00:14,460
you see the ToastAdListener
extends the base class AdListener.

5
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:18,346
Then you can see we have a
ToastAdListener that takes a Context as

6
00:00:18,346 --> 00:00:22,870
an argument because this Context object
would be required later on when we send

7
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:24,030
the Toasts.

8
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:27,850
Then we have our implementation
of the AdListener methods.

9
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:31,953
onAdLoaded, sending a Toast
with the message onAdLoaded.

10
00:00:31,953 --> 00:00:36,825
onAdOpen, sending a Toast
with the message onAdOpened.

11
00:00:36,825 --> 00:00:42,225
onAdClosed which sends a Toast
with the message onAdClosed.

12
00:00:42,225 --> 00:00:46,600
onAdLeftApplication, also sending
a Toast with this message.

13
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:51,720
And then the onAdFailedToLoad,
that takes an errorCode as the argument.

14
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:54,400
And we're performing
a switch on this errorCode

15
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:57,320
to see what the error actually was.

16
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:01,000
And for each of the error cases, you can
see that we assigned a human readable

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,370
string to the field mErrorReason.

18
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:08,020
And, at the end of the switch, you can
see that we're also sending a toast

19
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:14,030
message with the onAdFailedToLoad
plus the reason in parenthesis.

20
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:15,310
And finally, for this class,

21
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:19,420
we create the getErrorReason method
that returns the error reason.

22
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:23,060
Now, let's see how we can add
this adListener to our view.

23
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:25,360
So, we go to BannerActivity.

24
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:30,840
And you can see here that before we
build a request and we load the ad,

25
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:35,590
we're doing setAdListener on our
View object with an instance of our

26
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:40,420
newly created class ToastAdListener,
passing the context as an argument.

27
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,820
And that's how easy it is
to get these callbacks.

28
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:44,700
Let's check out the demo.
