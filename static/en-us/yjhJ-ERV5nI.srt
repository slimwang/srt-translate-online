00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:03,950
Are you or a loved one starting to lose your hearing? If so, you may need

2
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:09,096
DeciBoost, the affordable hearing aid. Have you ever wondered why we lose our

3
00:00:09,096 --> 00:00:13,524
hearing with age? Well, we hear because there are hair cells in our cochlea,

4
00:00:13,524 --> 00:00:17,062
our inner ear, and the smallest of these hair cells allows us to hear at the

5
00:00:17,062 --> 00:00:23,346
highest frequency of sounds. But with age these small hair cells are most

6
00:00:23,346 --> 00:00:28,506
likely to be damaged, leading to hearing loss and high frequency sounds. But

7
00:00:28,506 --> 00:00:33,780
with DesiBoost we can boost those high frequency sounds so you can hear them.

8
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:38,830
Buy DesiBoost today. For our concert goers out there we created deciboost two.

9
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:42,405
So, if you've been exposed regularly to sounds around 90dB, you may have early

10
00:00:42,405 --> 00:00:48,614
hearing loss. For example, a normal speaking voice is about 60dB. A jackhammer

11
00:00:48,614 --> 00:00:49,230
[NOISE]

12
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:53,566
about 90dB. A very loud nightclub or concert can range [NOISE]

13
00:00:53,566 --> 00:00:56,790
from 100 to 120dB. [MUSIC]

14
00:00:56,790 --> 00:01:02,154
And a jet engine can reach 130 decibels. So, if you've been to a lot of loud

15
00:01:02,154 --> 00:01:07,306
nightclubs or rock concerts, come on in and see us or give us a call at

16
00:01:07,306 --> 00:01:10,465
