00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,330
To answer this question we want to write code that

2
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:04,800
looks very similar to the code from before. We want to

3
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:07,660
create a box plot to compare the distribution of the number

4
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:11,220
of friendships initiated for our male and female users. So lets

5
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:13,960
just remind ourselves what variables we have in our data frame.

6
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:17,660
So for friend requests, I think I'll use friendships_initiated that sounds

7
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:20,630
right. To make my box plot I'll pass x the variable

8
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:23,875
gender, since that's my categorical variable. And then I'll pass y,

9
00:00:23,875 --> 00:00:27,190
friendships_initiated. Now I need to subset my data frame just like

10
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:29,550
from before. And then I'll need to tell cube plot that I

11
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:31,990
want to box plot. So I'll set the geom. Looking at

12
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:34,990
this plot, we see that most users make less than 500 friend

13
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:38,120
requests. So let's set our y limb setting zero as our

14
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:42,020
minimum and 500 as our max. So I'll add the cored_cartesian layer

15
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:45,120
and set my limits. It's really close, but it looks like

16
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,890
females have slightly more friend requests. Since the median black line is

17
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:52,250
slightly higher for females than this median black line

18
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:54,890
for males. Now, this might be too close to call.

19
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:57,250
So, I say we should zoom in again. This time,

20
00:00:57,250 --> 00:01:00,520
we'll change the upper limit to 150. Yeah, it looks

21
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:04,340
like females initiate slightly more friendships on average. Let's also

22
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:06,810
check this with a numerical summary. I can use the

23
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:09,990
by command and split friendships_initiated by gender and then, find

24
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:14,010
their summary. So, I'll take my friendships_initiated, split it by

25
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:17,320
gender and then run a summary. And here's our output. And

26
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:20,400
we can see that the median for females is 49 whereas

27
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,420
the median for males is 44. Now, you might be wondering,

28
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:26,000
why should we even create this box spot to begin with if

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,240
we can answer our question with a numerical summary. Well, it's

30
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:32,810
helpful to understand the distribution of the data. So in the case

31
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:35,160
of the box plot, we can see the middle 50% of

32
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:39,310
values for each segment of our categorical variable. Our box plots also

33
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:41,590
let us get a sense of alliers. So in one

34
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:44,930
way, they're much more rich with information than just this table.
