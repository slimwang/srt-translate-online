1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:05,360
So let us look at the semantic network representation of the relationship

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:10,630
between A and B. In one view of the transformation from A to B,

3
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:15,690
we can think of q, the outer circle, as remaining unchanged, and

4
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:19,790
p the inner circle, as getting deleted. Let's look at

5
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:25,250
another view of the transformation from A to B. In this view, we can think of

6
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:31,200
p as getting expanded and q, the outer circle, as getting deleted.

7
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:35,800
Both of these views are valid views. If both of these views are valid,

8
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:41,120
then how would anyone decide? How would an AI agent decide which view to select?

9
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:47,300
Let us suppose that the AI agent had a metric by which it could

10
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:52,290
decide upon the ease of transformation from A to B.

11
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:57,680
Let us suppose that, that metric assigned different weights to different kind of

12
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:02,320
transformations. You will notice that these transformations like scaling,

13
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:07,600
rotation, reflection make for a fine transformations. In this scale,

14
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:12,640
a larger value like 5 points, means more ease of transformation and

15
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,970
greater similarity. A lower value means less ease of transformation and

16
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:21,710
more difficult transformation and less similarity. Given the scale,

17
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:24,810
let us calculate the weight of transformations for

18
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:30,090
both transformation #1, and transformation #2. In transformation #1,

19
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:34,440
you can see that p is getting deleted, which we gave a weight of 1. And

20
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:38,934
q remains unchanged, which we gave a weight of 5. So the total weight here is 6.

21
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:45,850
In case of transformation #2, the weight of p being expanded, we said will be 2,

22
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:50,800
scaled. And, q getting deleted is 1, so the total weight is 3.

23
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:54,530
If you prefer the first transformation over the second transformation,

24
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:58,930
then we can see why someone will answer the square is the correct answer, and

25
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:05,020
not the triangle. Let us return to this exercise. And now we can see why

26
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:10,990
both 3 and 5 are legitimate answers. We can also see why an AI agent

27
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:15,090
may prefer 5, given the similarity metric that we talked about in the last shot.
