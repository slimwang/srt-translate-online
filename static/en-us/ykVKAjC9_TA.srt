Lets do one more, this is really to help with your conceptual understanding of

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:09,579
degrees of freedom. Have you ever played Sudoku? Well this is kind of like

3
00:00:09,579 --> 00:00:13,959
Sudoku, lets say that each row and each column has to add to 9, you can pick

4
00:00:13,959 --> 00:00:21,358
any numbers here in these nine entries as long as they meet this restriction.

5
00:00:21,358 --> 00:00:24,300
So how many values do you have a choice? How many degrees of freedom?
