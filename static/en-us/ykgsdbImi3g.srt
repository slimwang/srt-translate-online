1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Now with more noise,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
we need to increase k in k nearest neighbor

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
because a small number of neighbors might be insufficient.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
So the answer here is True.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
We'd like to generalize over more data points.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
If we use k means,

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
we shouldn't increase the number of cluster centers.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
We were just happy with the number of cluster centers,

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
and using more will make the situation worse.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Therefore, the answer is False.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
In Laplacian smoothing,

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
we should increase k because

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
we smooth more, which will accomodate

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
the problems introduced by the additional noise.

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Of course, we should never

16
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
use fewer particles in a particle filter.

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
That's clearly False.

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
And if more data is available,

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
we should always use it.

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Irrespective of the noise,

21
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
but specifically, if we have more noise

22
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
we should go through even more efforts to

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
find more data.

24
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
So this is absolutely True.
