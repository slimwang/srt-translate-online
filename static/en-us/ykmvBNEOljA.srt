00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
So now for a quiz: What are the risks of GUI capture replay tools?

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
They may capture sensitive information,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
which should not go to developers.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Recorded scripts may not be replayable in different environments.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Different because of different local, different resolution,

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
different font size, or different speed.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Recorded scripts may be prone to change

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
as the software or the GUI changes.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Check all that apply.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Over to you.
