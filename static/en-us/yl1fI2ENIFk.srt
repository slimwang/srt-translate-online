00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:05,190
So this is the solution for our ROB timing quiz. The first part,

2
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:09,740
we were asked when does this multiplication instruction issue, execute, write,

3
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:15,530
and commit. This instruction will issue in the second cycle.

4
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:20,680
The reason for that is that we have still two multiply divide reservation

5
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:25,500
stations. This is using the first one, we can use the second one here so

6
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:30,320
we can actually issue in the second cycle. So the correct answer here is two for

7
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,630
issue. For execution, we are using R5 and R6.

8
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:40,030
That doesn't depend on R2, so we can actually begin execution right after

9
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:45,650
we issue in cycle three. The multiplication will take two cycles to execute so

10
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:48,810
it's executing in cycles three and four. It's going to try and

11
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:54,380
write the result in cycle five. And now when does it commit? It commits when it

12
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:58,810
has both written the result and when all previous instructions have committed.

13
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:02,400
The previous instruction commit is, had happening later. So,

14
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:05,960
we will commit in cycle eight, right after the first instruction has committed.
