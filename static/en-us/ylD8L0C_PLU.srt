1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:05,260
So recall, in the previous, lesson, we talked about using a digital image as

2
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:08,560
a function, or representing a digital image as a function.

3
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:12,380
Now what want to try to do is, I want to try to, bring in the concept of how we

4
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:16,560
can use that, for simple forms of image processing.

5
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:17,880
Recall in the last lecture,

6
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:21,232
we talked about that an image is basically a function.

7
00:00:21,232 --> 00:00:24,681
Which is represented by various ways of scanning through it and x and

8
00:00:24,681 --> 00:00:27,525
y and also looking at the intensity values which would be

9
00:00:27,525 --> 00:00:30,590
basically the height map of an image like this.

10
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:34,640
Using this we basically constructed and stated that now we can actually create

11
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:39,380
a simple grid, like this, to be able to represent an image, and now we would be

12
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:44,460
able to pick up the values from each and every element of this matrix.

13
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:46,620
So, just to review this, what we're trying to do,

14
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:50,520
is basically we're interested in extracting discrete values of an image.

15
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,800
So what we want to do is sample the whole image,

16
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,060
in the two dimensions, in this case this matrix here.

17
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:59,240
And look for the values off of this matrix to be

18
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:03,150
able to do any kinds of computational processes on.

19
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:07,090
Of course this is approximation because it's quantizing each thing into

20
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:11,640
a districtized sample and what we basically now have integer values which we

21
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,950
will be then looking for to be able to extract the kinds of values from each

22
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:18,660
image, which will then be using in different computations
