1
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:03,863
Wow, what a day.

2
00:00:03,863 --> 00:00:04,873
>> Hey Chris?
>> What's going on?

3
00:00:04,873 --> 00:00:05,780
Oh, hey, what's up?

4
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:06,480
>> I got tell you, man,

5
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,400
I'm really impressed with
this application you wrote,

6
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,798
that actually shows where all
your coworkers are in real time.

7
00:00:10,798 --> 00:00:14,670
This is pretty cool, like it even
shows me as I'm moving it around.

8
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:16,910
>> Well, cool, thanks man,
yeah, it was fun to make,

9
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:19,990
the key is to keep an open connection
when the phone screen is off, so

10
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:22,110
that we can update your
location in real time.

11
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:24,470
>> Whoa, no,
tell me you're not doing that.

12
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,180
>> Well, you know, there were
some problems stopping the GPS

13
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:33,226
when folks entered the bathroom,
but I think that's a small.

14
00:00:33,226 --> 00:00:33,980
>> Dude, Chris.

15
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:34,690
>> To fix.

16
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:36,260
>> My battery just died.

17
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:40,000
>> Oh, dang that sucks maybe it's a dud.

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,750
>> Dud, Chris this is a brand new phone,
your application ate through my entire

19
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:48,310
battery in eight minutes, are you even
taking into account the battery churn?

20
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:50,980
Those open GPS and
networking connections are taking up?

21
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:53,950
>> I thought so,
I ran it through a bunch of tools.

22
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:55,250
>> Oh wait, timeout.

23
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:58,360
What, what tools are you using
to measure battery, Chris?

24
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:00,995
>> You know.
The usual ones like Logcat.

25
00:01:00,995 --> 00:01:02,330
>> [LAUGH] Okay.

26
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:06,040
Stop what you're doing,
we're going to go fix this now,

27
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:08,810
because this is an abomination,
all right, come on, let's get going.

28
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:09,900
>> 'Kay.

29
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,520
>> Oh, bring your backpack,
you're going to need it.
