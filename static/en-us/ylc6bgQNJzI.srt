00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,054
Let's look at these examples ,first let's say you saw a movie with a group of

2
00:00:03,054 --> 00:00:05,827
friends and you weren't sure how you felt about the movie until you were

3
00:00:05,827 --> 00:00:08,788
walking out and your group of friends start talking about how much they love

4
00:00:08,788 --> 00:00:13,906
the movie. And you find yourself liking the movie more and more ,now let's look

5
00:00:13,906 --> 00:00:16,850
at this scenario you walk into a waiting room of an office building and you see

6
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:19,840
people writing their daily schedules all over the wall with markers so after a

7
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,738
while in the waiting room, you pick up a marker and start writing your weekly

8
00:00:22,738 --> 00:00:29,706
schedule on the wall as well. So is scenario one a normative social influence

9
00:00:29,706 --> 00:00:35,505
or an informational social influence? And same question for scenario two. Write

10
00:00:35,505 --> 00:00:38,278
the corresponding letter in the box for the appropriate type of social

11
00:00:38,278 --> 00:00:39,429
influence.
