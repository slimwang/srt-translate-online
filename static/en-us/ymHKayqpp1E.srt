1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:03,100
So why don't we do gradient descent on y hat?

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:05,860
>> Well there could be many reasons but

3
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:08,800
the main reason is it's not differentiable. It's

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,560
a just discontinuous function. There's no way to

5
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:13,860
take the derivative at the point where it's discontinuous.

6
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:19,580
>> So this this activation thing. The, the change from.

7
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:25,570
Activation to y hat has this big step function jump in it, right, at zero.

8
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:30,010
So once the activation goes positive, actually at zero. It

9
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:31,950
jumps up to one. And before that, it's, it's not.

10
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:35,830
So the derivative is basically zero, and then that. Not

11
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:38,770
differentiable, and then zero again. So really, the zero's not giving

12
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:40,510
us any direction to push, in terms of how to

13
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:43,900
fix the weights. And the undefined part, of course, doesn't really

14
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:46,270
give us any information either. So this, this algorithm doesn't

15
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:50,770
really work, if you. Try to take the derivative through this

16
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:54,150
discontinuous function. But it does kind of, you

17
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:57,430
know. What if we made this, more differentiable? Like,

18
00:00:57,430 --> 00:00:59,760
what is it that makes this so undifferentiable? It's

19
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,440
this, it's this really pointy spot, right. So you

20
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,160
could imagine a function that was kind of

21
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:08,270
like this, but then instead of the point spot,

22
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:11,260
it kind of smoothed out a bit. Mm, like that.

23
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:15,090
So kind of a softer version of a threshold,

24
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,800
which isn't exactly a threshold. But this is differentiable.

25
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:21,150
>> Hm.

26
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:23,160
>> So that would kind of force the algorithm to put its

27
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,720
money where its mouth is. Like if that really is the reason, that

28
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,410
the problem is non differentiable, fine.

29
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:29,180
We'll make it differentiable. Now, how do

30
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:32,720
you like it? I don't know, how do we like it now [LAUGH]?

31
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,050
>> Well, I'll tell you how much I like it

32
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:36,740
when you show me a function that acts like that.
