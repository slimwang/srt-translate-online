00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:04,140
Well now that we've got the exercise part out of

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:07,500
the way let's return to the details of property three and

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:13,480
see what it means to faithfully represent that have the refinement

4
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:18,130
faithfully represent the specification. In fact we have to check three things.

5
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:22,140
There's three criteria that we have to look at. First of all,

6
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:27,510
is the refinement adequate? That is, is our refinement rich enough to represent

7
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:32,820
all of the abstract situations? Second, is the refinement total? That is,

8
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:37,210
are we sure that the cron, concrete level can't get into some state that

9
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:42,300
doesn't correspond to a possible abstract state? And the third criterion is,

10
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:46,560
does the refinement model the abstract level. That is, is each

11
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:51,340
abstract operation correctly implemented by a concrete one? We'll look at all

12
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:54,890
three of these criteria separately, after we introduce a little more notation.
