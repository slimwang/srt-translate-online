1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,962
So here's another story.

2
00:00:01,962 --> 00:00:08,070
A while back I heard a story about
some music tests that were being run,

3
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:12,080
and it was for an interface for
a washing machine or something.

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,158
And there was some problem that users
could encounter that was incredibly

5
00:00:16,158 --> 00:00:17,021
frustrating.

6
00:00:17,021 --> 00:00:20,414
It was a little bit of an edge case,
but it was incredibly frustrating.

7
00:00:20,414 --> 00:00:22,410
They'd lose a lot of time and
be really confused.

8
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:23,008
>> Right.

9
00:00:23,008 --> 00:00:26,470
>> And the testers, the designers
who were working on this project

10
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:30,745
went to the engineers and said,
hey, this is a big problem!

11
00:00:30,745 --> 00:00:33,050
>> Mm-hm
>> We should fix this.

12
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:37,870
And the engineers said, that's not a
problem, people don't actually do that.

13
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:39,090
Right, because engineers are smart.

14
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:40,090
>> Right.

15
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:44,910
>> And designers said,
we've seen people do this.

16
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:47,380
This is a big problem,
we should fix this.

17
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:50,170
And engineers go, all right,
we'll put it in the backlog,

18
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:53,880
which means they never
actually get around to it.

19
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:57,650
And so the designers went back to the
users, and did a bunch more user tests,

20
00:00:57,650 --> 00:01:02,100
and recorded the users and took video
of the users having this problem and

21
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,349
then saying, what just happened?

22
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:06,080
This is so confusing.

23
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:06,860
And then strung,

24
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:11,540
I think it was like 30 to 50 of
these users having this problem in

25
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:15,940
a row together, sat all the engineers in
a conference room and played the video.

26
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:18,940
And when you're sitting
In a conference room

27
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:23,080
watching a video of real people have
real problems with your product,

28
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:26,840
it's a lot harder to ignore those
problems than if it's just some person

29
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:29,960
saying they saw somebody maybe
have a problem with this once.

30
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:30,770
>> Right.
>> So

31
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:33,750
moral of the story,
take video, show it to people.

32
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:35,786
It's the most powerful
communication tool you have.

33
00:01:35,786 --> 00:01:36,481
>> Right.

34
00:01:36,481 --> 00:01:37,595
Thank you.

35
00:01:37,595 --> 00:01:38,422
>> Mm-hm.
