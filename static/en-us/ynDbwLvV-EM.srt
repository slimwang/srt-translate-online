1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:04,330
At this point, we've created
a prototype that has interactivity.

2
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:07,740
The hot spots that we've created will
allow anyone viewing our prototype

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:10,780
to interact with the images as
if they were the real thing.

4
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:15,810
It's important to note that while
there is some level of interactivity,

5
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:18,640
we don't want to add too many
interactions at this point.

6
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:24,360
Remember, the key here is having primary
navigation points, which enable you

7
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:28,680
to get feedback on whether a user can
achieve the intended task of your app.
