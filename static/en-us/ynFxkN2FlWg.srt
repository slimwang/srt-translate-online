00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,700
An Internet worm first scans for vulnerable

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:07,360
hosts, then infects them, and finally, typically takes

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:10,010
steps to remain undetectable. A worm does

4
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:13,660
not necessarily need to patch the host vulnerability,

5
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:15,870
although some Internet worms have been known

6
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:18,090
to do so, to prevent other worms from

7
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:21,650
subsequently infecting the machine and interfering with the

8
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:25,410
original worm infection. For example, if a worm

9
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:30,460
was intending to spread to construct a botnet that launched a particular

10
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:34,550
attack or was being used by a botmaster for a particular attack, then

11
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:36,730
whoever had commandeered the machine, probably

12
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:39,540
wouldn't want other attackers to come in

13
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:44,540
behind him and also infect the machine and interfere with the planned attacks.
