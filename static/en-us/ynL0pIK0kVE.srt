00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,960
If you were to design a version control system specifically for

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:04,490
code, what would it look like?

3
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:05,300
In the rest of this lesson,

4
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:08,660
we'll be discussing many ways version control systems can be different and

5
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:11,030
what a programmer would want in each case.

6
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:13,980
Wikipedia and Google Docs are clearly not designed for writing code.

7
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:17,110
They require you to use their special purpose editors that don't have any

8
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:19,600
features that programmers tend to want in an editor,

9
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,310
like syntax highlighting and parenthesis matching.

10
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:26,300
Using Dropbox is a more plausible alternative here since you can use any editor

11
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:29,640
you want and the files are saved on your computer, as well as in the cloud.

12
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,500
Similarly, when you save copies manually,

13
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,770
you can edit with whatever program you prefer.

14
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:36,870
Wikipedia also doesn't actually save files on your computer,

15
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,185
which would make it hard to run your code.

16
00:00:38,185 --> 00:00:42,325
Google Drive does let you save your Google Docs files on your own computer, but

17
00:00:42,325 --> 00:00:46,010
they're in a special format that only works with their special purpose editor

18
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:48,250
and you can't access the history offline.

19
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:49,460
Dropbox is similar.

20
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:51,590
Again, you can edit your files on your own computer, but

21
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:53,360
you can only see the history online.

22
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,100
Manual saving is the only option here that you can use offline.

23
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:59,200
Of course syntax highlighting and offline access to history aren't the only

24
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,350
areas where programmers would want different features in their version control.

25
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:05,730
The next feature I want to consider is whether users should manually choose when

26
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:09,160
to save or whether the systems should save versions automatically.

27
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:12,100
Let's think about which option would be better for code.

28
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:16,070
As a programmer, when would you want to have versions of your code saved?

29
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:18,460
Consider a few different use case scenarios when you're coming up

30
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:19,700
with your answer.

31
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:23,970
One option would be at regular intervals, maybe every hour.

32
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:27,750
Or maybe whenever there's a big enough change, maybe 50 lines or so.

33
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:30,850
Or maybe when there's a long pause in editing.

34
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:32,920
Or lastly, when you choose to save a version.
