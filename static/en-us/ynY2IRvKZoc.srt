1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:04,860
So the next question becomes, given a set of animals, or in general,

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:11,260
a set of objects or elements, and a set of percepts for each of those animals,

3
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:15,170
how can we decide what's a good equivalence class for those animals? Consider,

4
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:19,120
for example, the three animals shown here, eagle, bluebird, and penguin.

5
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:22,870
Let us suppose that we knew that there are six percepts that are important for

6
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:26,150
each one of these animals. Lays eggs, has wings, has talons, and

7
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:30,200
so on. But in order to decide what might be a good equivalence class for

8
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:33,200
these three animals, we first have to decide on what might be

9
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,050
the right values for each of these percepts for

10
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:39,030
each animal. So I'm going to ask you to use your background knowledge,

11
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:41,790
to fill in the values of the percepts that applies to each of the animals.
