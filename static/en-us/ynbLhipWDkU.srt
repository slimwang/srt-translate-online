1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:02,270
Well, fortunately, there is,

2
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:07,560
at least a partial solution to the problem of dealing with complexity in these,

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:13,870
in these systems. I say partial because no matter how nature notation is,

4
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:17,160
you'll always going to be confronted with systems that are more complex than it

5
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:21,950
can deal with. However, state charts, as developed by David Harel. Okay.

6
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:27,450
Our way of coping with this in, in a fa, in a fashion that allows you to

7
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:31,530
do the modeling of the system in a way that help you get an understanding of it.

8
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:37,609
He calls these his improvements to state transition diagrams, state charts.

9
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:45,735
And they provide, several mechanisms for, dealing with the, with the complexity.

10
00:00:45,735 --> 00:00:51,810
'Kay, and we'll be looking at those. State charts are a part of UML. Okay.

11
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:58,250
Tools support them, and, we will be, looking into them in a subsequent.

12
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:01,710
Lesson and giving you a chance to use them yourself.
