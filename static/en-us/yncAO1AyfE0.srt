00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,608
Personality disorders are maladaptive and inflexible patterns of cognition,

2
00:00:04,608 --> 00:00:09,370
emotion and behavior. And they generally develop in late childhood or

3
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:14,492
adolescence and continue into adulthood. Now there are three distinct clusters

4
00:00:14,492 --> 00:00:19,430
of personality disorders. There's odd and eccentric personality disorders.

5
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:25,017
There's dramatic and emotional personality disorders. And anxious fearful

6
00:00:25,017 --> 00:00:29,770
personality disorders. Now we're going to examine the first two in more detail.

7
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:34,710
Let's first start by looking at the odd and eccentric personality disorders.

8
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:38,560
First we have schizoid personality disorder. We see that people with this do

9
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:43,922
not want to be close in any of their relationships. They're reclusive,

10
00:00:43,922 --> 00:00:48,200
emotionally aloof, and humorless. And they also want to live solitary lives,

11
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:53,610
therefore we see them engage in solitary activities. They have no interest in

12
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:58,301
sex, they don't have close friends. And they don't seem to react to praise or

13
00:00:58,301 --> 00:01:03,030
criticism from others. Another odd-eccentric diagnosis is schizotypal

14
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:07,598
personality disorder. Here, we see these individuals being isolated and

15
00:01:07,598 --> 00:01:11,694
asocial, but we also see they have odd thoughts, perceptual distortions and

16
00:01:11,694 --> 00:01:18,052
beliefs. And we may see that these people dressed, act, or appear in peculiar

17
00:01:18,052 --> 00:01:23,430
or eccentric ways. And finally let's look at paranoid personality disorder.

18
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:27,770
People with paranoid personality disorder are extremely suspicious and

19
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:34,386
mistrustful of other people in ways that are unwarranted and not adaptive. They

20
00:01:34,386 --> 00:01:38,560
may often test the loyalty of their friends and lovers. Because they believe

21
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,460
others are trying to harm them. People with paranoid personality disorder may

22
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:46,177
be regularly suspicious of their spouses' faithfulness even if there's no

23
00:01:46,177 --> 00:01:51,698
evidence that the spouse has been unfaithful. But remember, these are extremes

24
00:01:51,698 --> 00:01:55,752
of personality. So questioning the faithfulness of a significant other doesn't

25
00:01:55,752 --> 00:02:00,544
necessarily mean you have a personality disorder. Remember, you would have to

26
00:02:00,544 --> 00:02:04,140
be extremely paranoid to the point of it interfering with your day life, to

27
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:07,389
consider this a personality disorder.
