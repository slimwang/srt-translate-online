1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
So now, we have two hypotheses and we'd like to test them.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
The null hypothesis is the basic hypothesis that something is correct

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
and unless proven wrong, we always believe null hypothesis is actually correct,

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
we trust the manufacturer or do we have sufficient evidence to be very high likelihood

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
the null hypothesis is wrong, the alternate hypothesis is correct then,

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
we reject the null hypothesis and we tell the manufacturer,

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
please print the label on the box because the number there isn't quite correct.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
So let's do it. To recap, we have sample 11 yeses and 4 nos.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
And our null hypothesis is equals p=0.9 and our alternate hypothesis, if it doesn't work,

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
as well as the null hypothesis, so p is smaller than 0.9.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
This is a very exact to the setup you're going to study when we make hypothesis test.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
If you look at the sample and it's obvious this is binomial

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
which is the fancy word for coin flips, binary experiments.

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
With 15 different experiments and under the null hypothesis probably goes 0.9.

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:13,000
So obviously, in this binomial distribution, there are about 16 different outcomes from 0 to 15.

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The most likely is 13, 14 is also pretty likely if the null hypothesis is correct,

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
and then the probability goes back to be down.

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
The key is assume that H₀ is actually correct, so the probability is 0.9,

19
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
then FIND was called the critical region under which 5% or less

20
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
of the total probability of this binomial designs for different lane.

21
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,000
You will place a mark over here that separates outcomes that invalidate the hypothesis

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:49,000
and outcomes that validate the hypothesis, so that all the outcomes, together, left off this marker

23
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,000
collect in totality at most the confidence level, in this case 5%.

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
So that if you find an outcome that sits to the left of this point,

25
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:07,000
you can say wow this outcome was so insanely unlikely under the null hypothesis, I just don't buy it.

26
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:13,000
If conversely the outcome is somewhere in this green box and it isn't that unlikely after all.

27
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Realize that each outcome itself might have a small likelihood,

28
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
but you don't care about the probability of the outcome itself.

29
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Even the maximum of the outcome has a small probability in this model.

30
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
All you care about is putting a separator within and except this region

31
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
and what's called the critical region and again the logic is

32
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
the critical region collects many possible outcomes, but in totality,

33
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
these probabilities don't exceed the 5%.

34
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
So if the final outcome is in the critical region, you can confidently say,

35
00:02:45,000 --> 99:59:59,999
wow, I'm really surprised I don't buy that H₀ is correct.
