[Thrun] For answering these questions, let me restate the essential formulas.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:12,000
W1 is obtained by M times sum of XY minus sum of X times sum of Y

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:19,000
over M times sum Xi square minus sum of Xi in brackets square.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
And if you plug in these numbers over here for M equals 5

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:34,000
because there's 5 training examples, we get 5 times 88 minus 10 times 35

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
over 5 times 30 minus 100, which is 1.8.

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
That is the correct answer for W1.

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:52,000
W0 was obtained by 1 over M times sum over Ys minus W1 over M times sum over X.

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:02,000
And plugging in the table over here gives us 1/5 times 35 minus 1.8 over 5 times 10,

10
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
and that is 3.4, which would have been the correct answer over here.

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
And again here are the data points with the solution.

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
So if you take the axis where X equals 0,

13
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
the Y value is actually 3.4, and the slope is 1.8.

14
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
It's a little smaller than if you just click at the end points,

15
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
which gave us a slope of 2, because there is a residual arrow over here,

16
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
residual arrow over here, residual arrow over here, and a residual arrow over here.

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,000
The resulting linear function ends up splitting in a quadratically optimal way

18
00:01:37,000 --> 99:59:59,999
the arrows between these different data points.
