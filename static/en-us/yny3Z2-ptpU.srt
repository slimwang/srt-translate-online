1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Now let's switch to the other part of game theory,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
which remember we called mechanism design.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
It could really be called game design.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
The idea is that someone is going to be running a game

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
that players are going to be participating in.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
We want to design the rules of the game such that we get a high outcome

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
or a high expected utility for the people that run the game,

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
for the players who play the game, and for the public at large.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Here's an example of a game.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
This is the advertising game.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Here I've shown it on an Internet search engine, where you do a search,

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
and then ads show up, sometimes at the top, sometimes at the right,

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
sometimes at the bottom of the page, depending on the mechanism.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
This is also done at sites like eBay that sell items,

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
and there's lots of places where auctions are run.

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
The idea of mechanism design is to come up with the rules of the auction

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:06,000
that will make it attractive to bidders and/or people who want to respond to the ads,

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
and make a good result for all.

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Now, one property that you would like an auction to have is to

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
attract more bidders to make it a more competitive market,

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
and you could attract more if it's less work for them.

22
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
It's easier for the bidders if they have a dominant strategy.

23
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
You saw how hard it was to work out the value of a game

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
when you didn't have a dominant strategy,

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
and how easy it is to work it out if you did.

26
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
If you want to save everybody a lot of trouble, design the game

27
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
so that dominant strategies exist.

28
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
These strategies have various names in auctions.

29
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Sometimes you call it an auction strategy proof

30
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
if you only need to know your own strategy.

31
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
You don't have to think about what all the other people are going to be bidding.

32
00:01:51,000 --> 99:59:59,999
They also call that truth revealing or incentive compatible.
