1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:03,610
>> Alright, so I'm just going to drag these down. Let's see. Where

2
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:06,370
do I want to drag them to, down to Band Detail I guess.

3
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:08,210
>> Yeah, but not above the name.

4
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:11,910
>> Oh, not above the name. Right. And I'll do that for all of them.

5
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:14,370
>> Yup. And so you have columns so you

6
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:16,470
can drag those fields to the other side also.

7
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:20,050
>> Okay. All right, cool. So I'll put my contact information

8
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:23,250
on the right column. I'll put this other stuff over here.

9
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:25,800
>> And if you wanted to,

10
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,650
at the top here, it says you can drag sections. So you can

11
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:32,775
even create new headers for more information, like if we had a finite

12
00:00:32,775 --> 00:00:35,860
set of stuff that was only about the stage, we could possibly drag

13
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:39,780
down a section and name it like stage information or something like that.

14
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:42,780
>> Cool. Okay, so that wasn't so bad. I

15
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:44,310
just had to drag all these fields on. I think

16
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:46,860
I still prefer using the Wizard, though, because I like

17
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:50,312
that it does everything for me. Schema Builder's cool, though.

18
00:00:50,312 --> 00:00:50,670
>> I mean,

19
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:52,310
there are tradeoffs to both. Definitely with

20
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:53,850
the Wizard it allows you to, you know,

21
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:56,440
do everything you might want to do from security

22
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:59,030
to field creation in one clean sweep. But

23
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,280
if we would say, knew our entire data

24
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,710
model, right from the beginning, it would probably

25
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:05,040
be pretty tedious to have to go through

26
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,200
the seven steps for let's say, 100 fields.

27
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:07,455
>> Right,

28
00:01:07,455 --> 00:01:07,540
[INAUDIBLE].

29
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:10,130
>> But dragging them all, you know, in the Schema Builder

30
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:12,740
it allows you do to a lot at once really quickly.

31
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:13,650
>> Okay, makes sense.
