1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,040
So we're going to find lots of good ways

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:06,330
to use both modulus and ord and chr operators.

3
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:10,040
So lets do one more quiz that's going to be a little trickier. What I want you

4
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:12,250
to answer is which of the expressions below

5
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:14,000
are always equivalent to X. So I have

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,940
exactly the same value of X where X can be any integer between zero and ten.
