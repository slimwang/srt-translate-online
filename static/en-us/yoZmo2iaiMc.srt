00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:04,410
The first property that we looked at is concerned with whether we understand

2
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:08,430
the problem we are trying to solve. Property two is concerned with whether we

3
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:13,190
have solved it correctly. We can state property two as follows, each level in

4
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:18,210
a design must be internally consistent. Technically, what this means is that we

5
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:23,470
must make sure that for each operation. Defined at that level.

6
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:30,510
Each operation leaves whatever invariants are there true.

7
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:33,460
That is, if the invariant was true before the operation took

8
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:37,650
place it's still true afterwards. The operations don't break anything.
