1
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:04,490
So in this case, this first one
here looks like a pretty good rule.

2
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:05,890
Let's break it down.

3
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:08,470
Okay, so
the first part of the statement is here.

4
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:11,310
And what this part of the statement
does is basically look up

5
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:14,160
the shared with data for
the listing question which remember,

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,600
stores the key that has the same name.

7
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:20,180
And this part of the rule right here
gets us the email of the current user

8
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:21,440
as I showed you before.

9
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:25,290
Now, if this email is part
of the sharedWith list,

10
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:27,780
then it'll be equal to
something other than null.

11
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:31,430
And if this email isn't part of
the sharedWith list which means that,

12
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:34,090
that user hasn't been
shared with on that list,

13
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:36,040
then this whole value will be null.

14
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,800
We do that comparison right here.

15
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,445
And that gives us the correct answer for
the rule.
