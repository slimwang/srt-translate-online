1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:06,650
In exponential form, this would be 2 the fourth power equals 16. Great thinking

2
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:11,500
if you got this equation. Keep in mind that our base on our logarithm is the

3
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:16,801
base for our exponent. And the answer to a logarithm are the result of taking a

4
00:00:16,801 --> 00:00:23,081
logarithm of a number as an exponent, so this 4 is the exponent for 2. And then

5
00:00:23,081 --> 00:00:29,630
this should make sense, the 16 must go here since 2 to the fourth equals 16.

6
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:33,718
Now another way to think about it,is going in the reverse direction. So, I'm

7
00:00:33,718 --> 00:00:39,327
going to right log base 2 of 16 equals 4 down here. We're in logarithmic form,

8
00:00:39,327 --> 00:00:42,454
so we want to send this base back up to be the base, and we want to send

9
00:00:42,454 --> 00:00:48,702
exponent back to its position. So, we'll have base of 2, raised to the fourth

10
00:00:48,702 --> 00:00:54,681
power. So, this is how we get 2 to the fourth equal to 16. We've just reversed

11
00:00:54,681 --> 00:00:58,804
the directions of the arrows from the first diagram that we saw. Either way you

12
00:00:58,804 --> 00:01:03,489
do it, you'll still get the correct answer. Just keep in mind your concept of

13
00:01:03,489 --> 00:01:09,196
which one's the base and then which one's the exponent. The result of a

14
00:01:09,196 --> 00:01:13,590
logarithm is always an exponent.
