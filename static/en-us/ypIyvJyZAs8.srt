1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:04,180
So, we're not going to use confidence intervals for this. Now, we don't know the

2
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:08,912
results yet because I'm just giving you this poll. But let's pretend that we get

3
00:00:08,912 --> 00:00:13,975
an average of 7.5 for how engaged you are, and an average of 8.2 for how much

4
00:00:13,975 --> 00:00:18,867
you think you're learning. So, these are hypothetical population parameters. Mu

5
00:00:18,867 --> 00:00:25,233
sub E for engagement, and Mu sub L for learning. We would say the associated

6
00:00:25,233 --> 00:00:31,058
standard deviations are 0.64 and 0.73. Now, let's say our distributions look

7
00:00:31,058 --> 00:00:35,630
like this, for each measure, so they're negatively skewed. And let's say I want

8
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:39,595
to get these means up, I'm going to try to do this by writing a song about the

9
00:00:39,595 --> 00:00:43,651
concepts in the next lesson, and then singing it. Maybe it'll help you stay

10
00:00:43,651 --> 00:00:48,649
engaged, because hearing a song can be entertaining. Maybe it'll help you learn,

11
00:00:48,649 --> 00:00:53,539
because hearing a song can you remember the concept and what it is. However, I'm

12
00:00:53,539 --> 00:00:58,621
not totally sure at this point that it might actually help rather than hurt your

13
00:00:58,621 --> 00:01:03,103
learning. So, instead of giving everybody this lesson without a clue as to

14
00:01:03,103 --> 00:01:07,292
whether or not it's going to help, I'm just going to give this lesson to a

15
00:01:07,292 --> 00:01:12,860
random sample of 20 students. Then, I have them anonymously take the same poll

16
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:16,243
you just did. Let's say we get the following sample means.
