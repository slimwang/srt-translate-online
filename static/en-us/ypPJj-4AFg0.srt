1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:02,650
Now I'm going to talk
about setting goals.

2
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:06,290
You probably have some personal
goals for yourself like getting fit.

3
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:08,890
Well, you can also set goals for
your app.

4
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:13,820
For example, you might set a goal for
users to click the donate button or

5
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:15,210
reach a certain level in the game.

6
00:00:16,475 --> 00:00:17,860
Or stay engaged with the app for

7
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:20,440
a certain amount of time,
hopefully not that long.

8
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:24,760
To set goals for
the app you go to the Admin interface.

9
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:29,100
And then in the View, you click Goals.

10
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:32,659
And then create New Goal.

11
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:36,640
When you're setting up a goal
you'll see a list of templates.

12
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:43,000
If you choose a template,
it fills in the name and the type for

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:43,680
you, like this.

14
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:48,350
But even if you choose a template,
you can change the name and type anyway.

15
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,360
So I'm going to start out
by creating a custom goal.

16
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:57,140
And you enter whatever name you want and
then you choose a type of goal.

17
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:03,320
So you can specify screen that
you want the users to reach or

18
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,930
duration how long you want them
to stay engaged with your app.

19
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:09,540
You can specify how many screens you
want them to visit in a session.

20
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:14,040
And you can also specify an event
like view product or show recipe.

21
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:19,920
So I'm going for
five screens per session min.

22
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:24,510
So after you set the name and the type,
you can add more detail for the goals.

23
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,000
The details you can set depend
on the type of the goal.

24
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:31,470
If the type is number
of screens per session,

25
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:32,780
well you choose how many you want.

26
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:36,900
I want at least five,
that would be greater than four.

27
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:41,460
If the type is duration, then you could
specify criteria for the duration.

28
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:42,420
How many hours, minutes,

29
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:47,380
seconds do you want the users
to stay engaged as a minimum.

30
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:51,090
If the goal type is destination,
then you specify the screen name.

31
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:56,510
And as you see, there' some flexibility
around how you specify the screen name.

32
00:01:56,510 --> 00:02:00,030
You can give a regular
expression if you want.

33
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:02,340
And notice the funnel option.

34
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:05,740
If you enable this, you can specify
the progression through your app

35
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:09,080
that you wont use to take
to reach the destination.

36
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:12,340
My advice is to start out with
the simpler options and as you

37
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:17,810
build your understanding of Analytics,
to add in more complex tracking.

38
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:21,130
For now, I'm not going to set a funnel.

39
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:25,560
If the goal type is event,
then you specify the category,

40
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:28,290
the action, the label and
the value of the event.

41
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:33,050
And actually you can specify any or
all of these starting with the category.

42
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:35,120
You could just set the category.

43
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,670
And leave the other values
blank if you wanted.

44
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:40,888
So I'm going to set up a goal
called five screen for

45
00:02:40,888 --> 00:02:43,870
my users to visit five
screens per session.

46
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:49,300
So I've chosen the type
Pages/Screens per session.

47
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,200
And I want them to go to at least five.

48
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,730
So that would be greater than four.

49
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:55,360
Then, I create the goal.

50
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,720
So now my goal is listed
in the list of goals.

51
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:04,810
Now you might be wondering,
do you need to write code for the goals?

52
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:08,720
Well, it depends, is order activity
tracking enabled for your app?

53
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,590
If it is, then you don't need to write
any code for screen-related goals.

54
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:18,680
Analytics will get hits for
all screen views.

55
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,890
But if the goal depends
on other kinds of hits,

56
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:26,380
such as event hits, then your app must
include the code to send those hits.

57
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:29,010
If auto activity
tracking is not enabled,

58
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:34,200
then your app must have the code to send
the hits that Analytics needs to figure

59
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,120
out if the goals are met, or not.

60
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:40,940
And that includes screen view hits,
because if auto activity tracking's not

61
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:45,920
enabled, Analytics won't
get screen view hits.

62
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,290
Other than the ones that get
explicitly sent by the app.

63
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,800
So I've created one goal for
my app so far.

64
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,960
But each app has a limit to
how many goals it can have.

65
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:59,750
After you create a goal,
you can't delete it.

66
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:01,180
There's no point in hunting around for

67
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:03,580
the delete button,
because it isn't there.

68
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:07,600
However, you can edit an existing
goal and change it completely.

69
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:10,590
So I'm going to change my goal.

70
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:14,630
My new goal is for users to read
the recipe for dinner suggestion.

71
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:17,240
There are two ways to express this goal.

72
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:20,570
Either I can set a goal for
users to click the Show Recipe button,

73
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:25,760
or I can set a goal for users to go to
the show recipe activity or screen.

74
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:33,030
So I'm going to set a goal for my users
to go to show recipe as a destination.

75
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:37,860
Now, my app sends a screen view hit
through the code in the on start method

76
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,770
of the show recipe activity.

77
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:41,610
So I need to make sure
that the screen name and

78
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:45,160
the goal is the same as the one
that gets set in the code.

79
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:50,790
And see here how it says verify this
goal, you can click on this to see

80
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:55,500
what the conversion rate would have been
for the date of the past seven days.

81
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,840
So this is only going to be helpful if
you actually have a bunch of data from

82
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,460
the past seven days.

83
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:04,485
And it has to be exactly the past
seven days, but not including today.

84
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:09,135
So now I'm going to save my goal,
and there it is.

85
00:05:09,135 --> 00:05:13,960
Now my app already sends a screen view
hit for the Show Recipe activity, so

86
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,615
Idon't need to make any
changes in my code.

87
00:05:16,655 --> 00:05:18,445
So I already have the app
running on the phone, and

88
00:05:18,445 --> 00:05:20,085
I didn't even need to redeploy it.

89
00:05:20,085 --> 00:05:24,149
I'm just going to go ahead and
show the recipe a few times.

90
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:26,920
And then I'm going to
need to wait a while for

91
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:30,450
the goals to show up in
the Analytics dashboard.

92
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:35,270
The real-time view in Analytics
doesn't show goal conversion,

93
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:38,670
so you may need to wait a while for
the goals to show up.
