00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,500
Now that we've done one together, I want you to try this one on your own.

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:08,080
Notice how we have a constant term on this side of inequality. Well, we really

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:13,204
don't want this over here. We want to set our quadratic equal to 0 first. What

4
00:00:13,204 --> 00:00:16,880
do you think you'll need to do first in order to get started? Once you've

5
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,432
gotten that first step, I want you to try and solve for all the possible

6
00:00:19,432 --> 00:00:24,664
solutions. Write your answer as a solution set in interval notation here. And

7
00:00:24,664 --> 00:00:25,530
good luck.
