00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:02,650
If you know how to create your own analysis, then you're

2
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:05,580
ready to choose a dataset. Now, we don't want you to use

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:08,430
a dataset that comes with our, or in our package, such as

4
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:12,350
the diamonds dataset or the empty cars dataset. Instead, you can choose

5
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:15,090
one of four datasets that we've collected or you can choose

6
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:18,690
to find your own. Now, I want to caution you, finding your

7
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:22,420
own dataset can take a lot of time. We only recommend finding

8
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:25,670
and cleaning your own dataset if you're comfortable with data munching or

9
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:27,860
if you're ready for a serious challenge. In

10
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:29,720
the instructor notes you'll find a link to

11
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:31,970
a checklist for finding your own dataset as

12
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:34,200
well as resources for finding publicly available data.
