00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,886
Did you get 18 5th and 3 5th? If you did, excellent work. This is a really tough

2
00:00:03,886 --> 00:00:07,775
problem. Even if you didn't get this answer. If you got part of the solution

3
00:00:07,775 --> 00:00:11,772
right, or some of the variables right, great work. I'm going to first solve this

4
00:00:11,772 --> 00:00:15,874
problem using substitution. So, if you chose this method, stay with me. If you

5
00:00:15,874 --> 00:00:20,212
tried elimination, fast forward until you see the word, elimination, here. Also

6
00:00:20,212 --> 00:00:24,052
at any point if you find a correction to your work, pause the video and then try

7
00:00:24,052 --> 00:00:28,038
and keep solving. Finding the types of mistakes you make is really important so

8
00:00:28,038 --> 00:00:31,991
that we can improve on our math skills. Try and think about the mistake you made

9
00:00:31,991 --> 00:00:35,696
and where you went wrong. Thinking about that mistake can prevent you from

10
00:00:35,696 --> 00:00:39,645
making it in the future. I think it's easier to solve for x using this equation.

11
00:00:39,645 --> 00:00:44,333
I just need to add y to both sides. So I have x equals 3 plus y, and remember I

12
00:00:44,333 --> 00:00:49,925
could also write this as y plus 3. Addition is commutative. Now that I've solve

13
00:00:49,925 --> 00:00:55,320
for x I can replace this x with the equivalent expression.3 plus y. So I have 3

14
00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:00,627
times 3 plus y plus 2y equals 12, I distribute the positive 3 to get 9 plus 3y

15
00:01:00,627 --> 00:01:05,815
plus 2y equals 12. 3y and 2y make positive 5y. And then I just carry down the

16
00:01:05,815 --> 00:01:11,001
terms. So 9 plus 5y equals 12. I can subtract 9 from both sides, so 5y is equal

17
00:01:11,001 --> 00:01:15,846
to 3. And finally I divide both sides by 5, so y equals 3 fifths. Now I can

18
00:01:15,846 --> 00:01:21,308
substitute the value of y, which is 3 fifths, into the second equation. I chose

19
00:01:21,308 --> 00:01:26,354
the second equation, because these coefficients were 1. It looked a little bit

20
00:01:26,354 --> 00:01:31,265
more simple than the first equation. So I plus in the value of 3 5th for y. Then

21
00:01:31,265 --> 00:01:35,852
I need to add 3 5th to both side to isolate x. So x is equal to 3 plus 3 5th. We

22
00:01:35,852 --> 00:01:40,789
know we can write this as a mixed number. The mixed number is 3 and 3 fifths. We

23
00:01:40,789 --> 00:01:45,126
have the whole number and then the fraction. Converting this to an improper

24
00:01:45,126 --> 00:01:48,964
fraction we would have 18 fifths. This is some amazing math work for

25
00:01:48,964 --> 00:01:53,318
substitution. If we use elimination I can multiply the second equation by a

26
00:01:53,318 --> 00:01:57,546
positive 2. This will allow me to eliminate the y variable. You might have

27
00:01:57,546 --> 00:02:02,808
chosen to multiply this equation by negative 3. That would've let you eliminate

28
00:02:02,808 --> 00:02:08,211
the x variable. That's okay, that could work too. 2 times x is 2 x. 2 times

29
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:13,674
negative y is negative 2 y. And 2 times 3 is 6. So I get 5 x is equal to 18, and

30
00:02:13,674 --> 00:02:19,418
the y's eliminate. To solve for x, we divide both sides by 5. So 1 x is equal to

31
00:02:19,418 --> 00:02:24,514
18 5ths. We know that y should be 3 5ths, so let's see if we can find it, using

32
00:02:24,514 --> 00:02:29,302
our x value. I'm going to use the second equation to find the value of y. I take

33
00:02:29,302 --> 00:02:34,194
18 5ths, and plug it in for x. So I have 18 5ths, minus y, equals 3. Well I know

34
00:02:34,194 --> 00:02:39,066
18 5ths is really 3 and 3 5ths. This is the mixed number that represents, or is

35
00:02:39,066 --> 00:02:44,982
equal to, this improper fraction. 5 goes into 18 3 times and I have a remainder

36
00:02:44,982 --> 00:02:50,807
of 3, or 3 5th. So I have to take away some number from 3 and 3 5th to get 3.

37
00:02:50,807 --> 00:02:57,141
Well, this number has to be 3 5th. If I just think about it I know why it has to

38
00:02:57,141 --> 00:02:59,642
be 3 5th. There's our solution.
