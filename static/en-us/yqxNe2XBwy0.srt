00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,270
Your task in this exercise is to set the pivot point for the body and head to

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:07,741
be around the crossbar. Think back to the unit on transforms. We saw how the

3
00:00:07,741 --> 00:00:12,258
snowman's arms could go to the wrong place with a bad order of transforms. If

4
00:00:12,258 --> 00:00:15,714
we translate it then rotate it, the arms would swing wildly in their position

5
00:00:15,714 --> 00:00:21,134
similar to the drinking bird; however, it's a bit trickier than that. The birds

6
00:00:21,134 --> 00:00:24,530
body and head are in the correct spots, so where would be translate them to.

7
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:28,474
Think about it this way, say we constructed the bird a bit differently. Instead

8
00:00:28,474 --> 00:00:31,078
of moving the body and head to their final location, what if we moved them so

9
00:00:31,078 --> 00:00:35,144
that the center of the cross bar were was at the origin. Then, the body and the

10
00:00:35,144 --> 00:00:39,436
hat would be right location for rotating around the crossbar. We could then put

11
00:00:39,436 --> 00:00:42,327
both parts into an object 3D, such as the body head object, and apply the

12
00:00:42,327 --> 00:00:46,963
rotation to this parent. We could then move the parent to the proper location

13
00:00:46,963 --> 00:00:50,512
after performing the rotation. Your job is to modify the create drinking bird

14
00:00:50,512 --> 00:00:54,480
method so that the pivot is set correctly. I've given you a variable pivot

15
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,921
height which is the height of the cross bar above the origin. I'll also give

16
00:00:58,921 --> 00:01:02,734
you a hint. It should take about 3 lines of code inside just this method to set

17
00:01:02,734 --> 00:01:04,099
the pivot.
