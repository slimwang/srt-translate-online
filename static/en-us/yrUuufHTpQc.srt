>> Now we're going to want to solve our new equation, which you'll notice I

2
00:00:03,906 --> 00:00:07,866
switched the order of the sides, because I just like looking at it better this

3
00:00:07,866 --> 00:00:12,285
way. We now have the quantity x minus 4 times the quantity x plus 3 equaling 0.

4
00:00:12,285 --> 00:00:16,567
Now the question is, which values of x satisfy this equation? I'm not going to

5
00:00:16,567 --> 00:00:20,767
tell you how many values there are, but I'd like you to write as many as you

6
00:00:20,767 --> 00:00:24,967
find all in this box. And if you get more then one answer, I'd like you to

7
00:00:24,967 --> 00:00:27,478
separate each of your answers by commas.
