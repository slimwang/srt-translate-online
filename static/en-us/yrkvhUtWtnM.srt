00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:04,546
I showed how three rotation matrices multiplied together gives a single new

2
00:00:04,546 --> 00:00:09,525
matrix. Interestingly enough, this resulting matrix R is, in fact, a rotation

3
00:00:09,525 --> 00:00:13,773
matrix itself. Any number of rotation matrices multiplied together always

4
00:00:13,773 --> 00:00:17,976
results in another rotation matrix. This resulting rotation matrix will have a

5
00:00:17,976 --> 00:00:22,597
single specific axis and rotation angle. I have two questions for you. First of

6
00:00:22,597 --> 00:00:27,097
all, can you multiply a series of translations together and get a single

7
00:00:27,097 --> 00:00:32,137
translation matrix? Second, can you multiply a series of scales together and get

8
00:00:32,137 --> 00:00:37,279
a single scale matrix? For example, say you apply a number of scales in a row to

9
00:00:37,279 --> 00:00:41,128
an object. If you multiply all these scale matrices together, do you get a

10
00:00:41,128 --> 00:00:43,983
single scale matrix? Or do you get something else?
