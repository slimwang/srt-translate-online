00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,535
Here's the perspective matrix formed from the 3JS parameters, the numbers in

2
00:00:03,535 --> 00:00:06,340
the upper left three by three are scale factors, similar to how the

3
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:11,814
orthographic projection works, though the z scale's a little different. There's

4
00:00:11,814 --> 00:00:15,414
also a translation factor for z. However, the big differences here are that

5
00:00:15,414 --> 00:00:18,629
there's a negative one in the last row. And the lower right corner now has a

6
00:00:18,629 --> 00:00:22,310
zero. I'm not going to derive this projection formula here. Most good 3D

7
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:26,002
graphics texts run through this process. Also be aware that for some

8
00:00:26,002 --> 00:00:29,084
formulations, the near and far values are negative since you're traveling down

9
00:00:29,084 --> 00:00:33,322
the negative z axis. The one headache of keeping things in a right handed

10
00:00:33,322 --> 00:00:37,626
system is the whole plus is the axis points at the viewer problem. I'm using

11
00:00:37,626 --> 00:00:40,681
positive near and far values in this matrix, because that's how 3JS specifies

12
00:00:40,681 --> 00:00:44,868
things and thank heavens for that. In fact these two values must be positive

13
00:00:44,868 --> 00:00:48,609
numbers for the perspective transform. You can see things would get weird if

14
00:00:48,609 --> 00:00:52,710
the near value for example was somewhere behind the camera. For orthographic

15
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:56,128
projections we can use whatever numbers we want for near and far. Even negative

16
00:00:56,128 --> 00:00:59,893
values since we're really just selecting a box in space. For perspective we're

17
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:03,042
doing something more elaborate with transforming space so these values must be

18
00:01:03,042 --> 00:01:06,621
positive. The interesting thing is how this perspective matrix works with

19
00:01:06,621 --> 00:01:11,272
coordinates. Let's take a nice simple case. Field of view 90 degrees, aspect

20
00:01:11,272 --> 00:01:17,114
ratio one. near 1 and far 11. This gives us this matrix. Let's use this matrix

21
00:01:17,114 --> 00:01:18,840
on some test points and see what we get.
