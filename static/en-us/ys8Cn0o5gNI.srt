Hi, welcome back.

2
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:07,670
So Tableau is really good at grouping
data together and letting you kind

3
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:11,620
of drill down into these groups,
in what they call hierarchies, right?

4
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:15,687
So could you show us an example of
some hierarchies you've used and

5
00:00:15,687 --> 00:00:17,220
data you've looked at?

6
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:19,493
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and actually I have
a really great example for

7
00:00:19,493 --> 00:00:20,638
hierarchies right here.

8
00:00:20,638 --> 00:00:24,580
I have a dataset that has
the top grossing movies and

9
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:30,732
you can see those movies by director,
by genre, by a number of different ways.

10
00:00:30,732 --> 00:00:37,980
And so I'm curious about the genre and
actually the profits by genre.

11
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:43,620
So here I'm looking at
the profits by genre and

12
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:48,180
I'm seeing that the genre of
Adventure had the most profits.

13
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,990
But what about that drill down
that you're talking about,

14
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:53,570
which adventure movies
had the most profits?

15
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:57,120
Well, here I also have a dimension for
Movie Title,

16
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,860
and what I can actually do is
I can drag that onto genre and

17
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:03,990
it's going to create a hierarchy for
me, okay?

18
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:09,602
So now up here I can see a plus sign
next to Genre and if I click on that,

19
00:01:09,602 --> 00:01:14,640
I can see the movie titles that
are next to the genre, right?

20
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,156
And so now I can start to see,
within that Adventure category,

21
00:01:18,156 --> 00:01:21,600
Star Wars actually
generated the most profits.

22
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,300
&gt;&gt; That's very interesting.
