Okay! Unit 3 homework. We've only got to do 1 thing in this homework,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
and it is build a blog. [Chuckle]

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Specifically, we want a front page that lists your entries--

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
it doesn't need to list all of the entries, but it should list at least the 10 most recent or so--

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
a form to submit new blog entries--this needs to check for errors to make sure

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
both fields--a title and a blog body--are present,

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:34,000
and if it is successful, it should redirect to a permalink page for the entries.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
This is just--a permalink is just a link to a specific entry.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
And that's that! Let me give you a demo of what I'm expecting.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Here is Udacity-cs253.appspot.com/blog. This is a blog I've made.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I only have 1 entry, and in this particular case, it's just "The Raven".

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
We can go to /newpost if we want to enter a new post.

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I can type in a title.

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
If I were to submit this form without a body, I would get an error message

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
that requests both a title and a body,

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
and if I were to click submit with a title and a body,

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I would get redirected to the permalink page, which just appears at some URL.

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
And we can see my title and the body,

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,000
and I can go back to the front page--/blog--and see, in my particular case,

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
the 10 most recent entries.

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
So, this is what I'd like you to build.

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
We've got more details in the description for this homework in terms of form parameters

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
and all of the redirection handling things we're expecting,

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
and when you're done, submit the URL of your blog here.

25
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Okay! Good luck!
