00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,639
Let's look at the solution to our
2-way set-associative cache quiz.

2
00:00:03,639 --> 00:00:08,063
As before, the answer to this
type of question requires us to

3
00:00:08,063 --> 00:00:13,200
figure out which bits in the address
determine what in the cache.

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:19,350
So the address will be broken
into offset, in this case 5 bits,

5
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:24,610
index, in this case, two bits to tell
us which set we have, and a tack,

6
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:29,920
seven bits are used by the index,
and the offset, with means,

7
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:34,330
that the index will be determined by
the least significant two digits.

8
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:40,580
So we can figure out
that 0003 is like this.

9
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:44,150
Five bits are the off set,
the next two bits are the index.

10
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:50,330
So this maps to set zero,
and we will put F303 there.

11
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:53,330
Next one is F503.

12
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:58,960
It maps to the same set but
this set now has two places,

13
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:05,550
so we can actually put F503 in
the other line in that set.

14
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:06,620
Next, we have F563.

15
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:11,440
6, 3 is like this.

16
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:15,600
This maps to set number 3,
and finally EF63,

17
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:20,880
is going to map to the same set,
and we'll put it here.

18
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:26,420
So as you can see, with the 2-way set
associative cache, we can put more than

19
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:31,780
one block that maps to the same place
in the cache and not have conflicts.

20
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:34,130
This is why we want to
have a 2-way cache or

21
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:36,970
more because it reduces
the number of conflicts.

22
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:40,180
However, it complicates the tagged
checks because now when

23
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:43,030
we're looking for something we
have two places to search before

24
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:44,440
we're sure whether it's there or not.
