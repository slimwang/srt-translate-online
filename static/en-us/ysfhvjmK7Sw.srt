00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Well, let's go over it together.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
It looks temptingly like there might be a few left angle brackets,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
like this one or that one, but if you look carefully,

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
you'll see that those are both part of the comment, so it's as if they were never there,

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
so we don't see any left angles.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
We do see a left angle slash over here at the end of the string.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Any right angles?

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Yes, right here at the absolute tail end of the string,

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
but note that this one in here did not count.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Any strings?

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
"World" looks super tempting, but again, it's inside the comment, so it does not count.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Word--and I've intentionally chosen these so that they conflict a little--

13
00:00:43,000 --> 99:59:59,999
word, both "hello" and "confusing" totally apply.
