1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Let's give you practice with one more example.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I want you to define for me the function all_ints,

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
which generates the infinite stream of integers in the order of 0 first,

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
then +1, -1, +2, -2, +3, -3, and so on.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Put in your definition.
