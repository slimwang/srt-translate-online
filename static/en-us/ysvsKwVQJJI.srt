Now that we have considered storage, let's revisit retrieval. We talked about

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:09,470
two different ways of organizing the case memory, a tabular way and

3
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:14,800
a discrimination tree. How can we retrieve the case relevant to a given problem?

4
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:20,550
We assume here that the new problem has the same features in its description as

5
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:24,940
the cases stored in the memory. Earlier when we were storing a case in memory,

6
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:29,220
at that time we were navigating this tree to find where in this tree should we

7
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:33,800
store the new case. This time, we'll use the problem to navigate this tree and

8
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,160
find out which case is most similar to the problem.
