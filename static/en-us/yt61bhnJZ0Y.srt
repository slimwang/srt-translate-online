00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:05,229
Just like linear equations, we can also Check a Quadratic Equation. After we

2
00:00:05,229 --> 00:00:08,934
solve for our two answers, negative 2 and negative 3, we can plug them back into

3
00:00:08,934 --> 00:00:12,683
our original equation to make sure we're correct. I want you to check our two

4
00:00:12,683 --> 00:00:16,553
solutions by plugging in the appropriate numbers into the parenthesis.
