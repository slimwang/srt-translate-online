1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,300
So we're in a predicament. We want a small bin size to have as much detail as

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:08,430
possible about the location of data values, relative to the rest of the

3
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:13,276
distribution. But eventually, we start losing the shape of the distribution. But

4
00:00:13,276 --> 00:00:17,546
if we have a large bin size, then we can't tell the proportion less than any

5
00:00:17,546 --> 00:00:22,766
data value. We're going to handle this conundrum using a theoretical model for

6
00:00:22,766 --> 00:00:28,261
our distributions. This model is a smooth curve that uses relative frequencies.

7
00:00:28,261 --> 00:00:33,481
This is a theoretically continuous distribution that can be described with an

8
00:00:33,481 --> 00:00:38,322
equation. This simple feature, an equation, allows us to calculate the

9
00:00:38,322 --> 00:00:43,720
proportion between any two values on the x axis. We're not going to discuss or

10
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:48,494
analyze this equation in this class, but we can definitely go in depth into

11
00:00:48,494 --> 00:00:53,157
forms if you'd like. Now what will be the area under this curve? This is a

12
00:00:53,157 --> 00:00:58,272
really tricky problem. Just remember that when we had a histogram, what did all

13
00:00:58,272 --> 00:01:00,496
the relative frequencies add to?
