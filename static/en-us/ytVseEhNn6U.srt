1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,850
So the answer is none.

2
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:04,100
What we just tried to
do is actually illegal.

3
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:07,670
We've tried to combine two
pennants of different sizes.

4
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:11,000
And notice what happens in both
of these first two choices.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,815
They both violate the complete
binary sub-tree rule.

6
00:00:14,815 --> 00:00:17,530
So this was kind of a trick question.

7
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:21,550
But the point was to reinforce an
extremely important fact out pennants,

8
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:24,030
which is that you cannot
combine two pennants and

9
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:27,110
obtain a new one unless
the pennants have the same size.
