>> That was correct, David. Now this particular problem might look very simple.

2
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:38,430
Because for you and me as humans, going from this state to this state is almost

3
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:43,720
trivial. But notice how many different questions arose in trying to analyze

4
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:49,450
this problem. Clearly, you and I as humans must be addressing these issues.

5
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:54,510
This kind of A.I anaylsis makes explicit what is usually tacit when humans solve

6
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:58,830
this problem. And that is one of the powers of A.I.. Indeed we have left a lot

7
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:03,170
of questions unanswered. But each unanswered question then requires an answer.

8
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:07,200
Now we know that if you must develop methods that somehow will help to

9
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,640
address those questions. Like genetic [x] tests and like [x] dialysis.

10
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:17,480
Problem reduction is a universal method. It is applicable very large class of

11
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:21,860
problems. Once again, problem reduction does not provide guarantee of successes.
