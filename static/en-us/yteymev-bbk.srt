1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,210
One of the things the operating
system does is protect

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:05,430
resources that need to be protected.

3
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:06,740
How does that work?

4
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:10,310
Well, the way it works is
because we give control of

5
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:13,620
the resources to the operating system.

6
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:18,530
We say you can't directly, untrusted
applications can't directly access it.

7
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:21,450
So, operating system has control and

8
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:26,370
it's actually going to control access to
these resources, and we know it can do

9
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:29,400
that because of the complete
mediation requirement that we have.

10
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:33,737
So, anybody who wants access to such
a resource actually has to come through

11
00:00:33,737 --> 00:00:37,805
the operating system and when they
come through the operating system,

12
00:00:37,805 --> 00:00:41,936
the operating system is going to be
able to say yeah this is okay or I'm not

13
00:00:41,936 --> 00:00:46,380
going to allow or grant access or I'm
going to deny this particular request.

14
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:50,345
So how does the operating system
actually sort of mediate these requests

15
00:00:50,345 --> 00:00:53,140
that we're going to have for
various resources and

16
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:54,710
that needs to be protected?

17
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:58,280
First it must establish
who's making the request.

18
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:01,790
What is the source of the request?

19
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:03,978
Request always has a source.

20
00:01:03,978 --> 00:01:06,360
The entity that's making the request and

21
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:09,770
it has a target which is the resource
that is being requested.

22
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:13,970
So the operating system has to
know who is making the request and

23
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:15,810
what is being requested.

24
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:21,210
So the who part is typically answered
by this thing we called authentication.

25
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:24,390
We're going to talk more
about it in a future lesson.

26
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:28,600
But authentication essentially
establishes on whose behalf

27
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:31,540
a certain application or
a process is running.

28
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:34,390
So that's the user who's
making the request.

29
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:37,080
Once we know who is making the request

30
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:40,810
then we have this thing called
authorization or access control.

31
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:45,920
This is really checking,
looking up if this source of the request

32
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,860
is allowed to access the resource for
which the request is being made, okay.

33
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:54,040
You may be allowed to
access a certain file or

34
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:58,020
you may not be able to access a file
because it doesn't belong to you.

35
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:01,480
So the check that we're going to do
is called the access control check.

36
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:05,530
So the trusted computer base of
the operating system really does

37
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:09,008
It doesn't decide who accesses
a given resource or not.

38
00:02:09,008 --> 00:02:10,720
That's called select policy.

39
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,310
You have to decide who you're
going to share your resources with or

40
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:19,010
what other applications can share
a given file that you have.

41
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:20,570
So that's the policy.

42
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:22,710
But the fact that when a request for

43
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:27,010
the resource comes,
being able to do that access check.

44
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:31,170
The mechanisms are essentially that part

45
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:35,360
which intervene between
the source of the request and

46
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,910
the check that we going to do to
determine if the policy that we have in

47
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:45,330
place is going to tell us whether
the resource can be granted or not.

48
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:51,440
So the mechanism is essentially
this check that we are performing.

49
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:56,410
And the goal of address computing
base is to implement and

50
00:02:56,410 --> 00:03:00,560
do that in a structured fashion
the checks or how the mechanisms for

51
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:06,190
doing these checks that going to allow a
variety of policies to be implemented or

52
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:07,680
supported in the system.

53
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,580
The protection of the resources
when you talk about it.

54
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:14,200
Always we have to know where
the request is coming from.

55
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:18,010
Whether the the requester
is allowed to access it and

56
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:22,460
that's what the trusted computing base
has to do and it does it by providing

57
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:26,970
these mechanisms to support variety
of access control policies.
