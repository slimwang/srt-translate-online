00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:04,954
So now you've experimented with the die applet. And you've seen how the sampling

2
00:00:04,954 --> 00:00:10,621
distribution changes when we have larger sample sizes. But try one more applet.

3
00:00:10,621 --> 00:00:16,254
This time we have an actual population distribution. Rather than just the values

4
00:00:16,254 --> 00:00:22,252
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Like we did with the dice. So this time, you can start

5
00:00:22,252 --> 00:00:27,522
with a parent population being normally distributed. Or you can start with a

6
00:00:27,522 --> 00:00:33,485
uniform distribution for the population, or skewed, or custom. You can draw a

7
00:00:33,485 --> 00:00:42,110
bimodal distribution, and then you simulate taking for example, five values from

8
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:49,306
this population, finding the mean. And graphing it. So I clicked animated here,

9
00:00:49,306 --> 00:00:54,390
and it found five random values from this population, and then plotted the

10
00:00:54,390 --> 00:01:01,550
sample mean. Let's do that same thing 1,000 times. So here's the distribution of

11
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:06,110
sample means, and you can even calculate the standard deviation of this

12
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:11,681
distribution, because here we have the population parameters. So the standard

13
00:01:11,681 --> 00:01:19,381
deviation of this distribution should be 7.88, the population standard deviation

14
00:01:19,381 --> 00:01:27,486
divided by the square root of 5. Try it out, do you get 3.54? You probably get

15
00:01:27,486 --> 00:01:32,296
something pretty close, and that might be because this standard deviation is

16
00:01:32,296 --> 00:01:37,224
treating this as a sample, so it's using Bessel's correction. That means that

17
00:01:37,224 --> 00:01:42,729
this standard deviation would be slightly bigger than if we were calculating it.

18
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:47,754
Treating this as a population. But that's besides the point. Play around with

19
00:01:47,754 --> 00:01:51,826
this. This will really help you get to know sampling distributions. And we're

20
00:01:51,826 --> 00:01:56,040
going to use sampling distributions throughout the rest of the course. The

21
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:01,000
important thing to take away here is that you can have any population of any

22
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,476
shape. And then, if you plot the distribution of sample means, you'll get a

23
00:02:05,476 --> 00:02:11,103
normal distribution. And it will be more an more normal as n increases. Remember

24
00:02:11,103 --> 00:02:16,323
though if n is 1 then the distribution of means is just going to look like the

25
00:02:16,323 --> 00:02:21,778
population distribution. We don't just need to use computer applets to

26
00:02:21,778 --> 00:02:27,805
demonstrate the central limit theorem we can use real materials, too. Professors

27
00:02:27,805 --> 00:02:32,883
Laraway and Rogers prepared the following example for you. Check it out.
