00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,460
Now, imagine that the co-op found, after their program, a mean of 126 for their

00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:08,730
sample. Given that, go and compute the mean difference. That is, the difference

00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:10,920
between the sample mean and the population mean.
