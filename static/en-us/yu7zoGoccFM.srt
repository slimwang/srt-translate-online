00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,230
High quality lenses can be used to improve clarity for

2
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:05,840
the eye or for a camera, the brain cannot influence

3
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:09,540
this area. Too much light can temporarily or permanently blind

4
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:12,400
eyes but will also blind a typical camera as the

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,710
image produced will be overexposed often appearing all white. It's

6
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:19,300
the eye that's damaged, not the brain's interpretation of what

7
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:22,310
the eye is seeing. Muscles in the eye control the

8
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:26,150
eye's focus but the brain does not interpret the image differently.

9
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:29,470
The answer is that we see images right side up.

10
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:32,330
Look at our pinhole camera model. The image is actually formed

11
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:36,030
upside down. The simple idea that the image on a retina

12
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:39,390
goes directly into our brain in that form is clearly false.

13
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:41,600
There is in fact a considerable amount of processing that

14
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,470
occurs in the brain beyond just rotating the image 180 degrees.

15
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:48,210
For example, our eyes have blind spots where the optic nerve

16
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:51,580
is attached. Our brains fill in this area with the surrounding

17
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:53,590
elements in the scene.
