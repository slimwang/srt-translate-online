1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The answer is actually both the first and the third

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
are likely to be significantly greater than 1/2. The second is not.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Assuming the keys have as many 0s and 1s

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
as the good key rotor should be designed to have,

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
this is likely to be equal to 1/2.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
There is no reason to expect it to be greater

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
than 1/2 any more likely than it'd be less than 1/2.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
We're XORing two consecutive key bits.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
The other two are different from 1/2.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
This is what gives us the opportunity and what gave Bletchley Park the insight

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
needed to break the cipher.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
For the third one, this followed from the structure of the machine.

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
When the S wheels advance this probability is about 1/2,

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
but when they don't advance ΔS is always 0.

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
This means the probability that ΔS is 0 is significantly greater than 1/2.

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,000
It turns out for the structure of the Lorenz machine it's about 0.73.

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
To know that you'd have to look in more detail at the structure of the M wheels

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
to know how frequently the S wheels advance.

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
When they don't advance we know the result is 0.

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
When they do advance about half the time the result will be 0.

21
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Getting the first one right required a little more linguistic insight.

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The reason this is greater than 1/2 depends on subsequent message letters.

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
If adjacent letters in the message are the same,

24
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
that ensures that ΔM is equal to 0.

25
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
It turns out that this is a property that many languages have.

26
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
You can see that English has it.

27
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
We have repeated letters here. We also have some repeated letters in "wheels."

28
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
It's more like that you would expect by just the normal letter distribution

29
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
for subsequent letters to be identical.

30
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:53,000
It turns out that this is a property of German that about 3.3% of digraphs,

31
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
meaning two adjacent letters are the same letter.

32
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
That means the probability that the messages are equal--

33
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
well, they could be equal for lots of other reasons,

34
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:10,000
but this bias is towards being more likely to be zero than non-zero.

35
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,000
It turns out that that's 0.61 probability for German.

36
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Both of these are numbers that you didn't have enough information to guess on your own.

37
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
You would need to have a analysis of German text to know

38
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
that this is the probability here,

39
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
and you would need a lot more details on the M wheels to be able to get that.

40
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Don't feel bad if you didn't get this quiz correct,

41
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
although the structure of the machine should have been enough to guess

42
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
that this is greater than 1/2,

43
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
and if you're familiar with German

44
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
or could guess that it has properties similar to English,

45
00:02:43,000 --> 99:59:59,999
you might have been able to get this one as well.
