1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:05,367
So with 3 bits you could have 8 distinct
values, but with 4 you can have 16,

2
00:00:05,367 --> 00:00:07,290
which is the answer to this quiz.

3
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:11,540
Each additional bit could be a 1 or
a 0, so

4
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:13,660
it doubles the number of
possible values there are.
