Welcome to problem set three, let's dive right in.

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:06,300
In the unit, we talked about a problem called k-coloring,

3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:09,210
and just in case you don't remember it, let's go over real quick.

4
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:14,420
Let's say we had a graph and let's say we want to give all the vertices different colors.

5
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:16,110
Well, not different colors,

6
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:21,330
but we want to give them colors so that neighboring vertices never have the same color

7
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:23,470
like keyword on a map for instance.

8
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:26,820
Let's go ahead and start, I would green color this one.

9
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:33,430
That means if we want to move to another color, we can color the adjacent ones a different color

10
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:38,440
but we can't color any of these green because this is connected to all the vertices.

11
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:45,900
So, let's start off this one and color that red but that means we can't color that red.

12
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:49,390
We can color one of these red, so let's go ahead and do that too.

13
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:53,980
Let's color this one red. That means this one can no longer be colored red either.

14
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:58,820
Neither of this can be colored red or green, so let's color them purple.

15
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:02,480
And now, we completely colored this graph with three colors,

16
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:12,530
and at least for k>2, whether a graph can be colored and k many colors,

17
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:14,890
is an NP complete problem.

18
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:17,640
Now, in order to show the k-coloring is complete,

19
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:24,250
really what we can do is simply reduce clique to k-coloring,

20
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:29,260
and there are two basic facts that help us to do this.

21
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:35,020
The first question we need to answer is that if a graph contains a clique of size k,

22
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:38,910
then how many colors are needed to color the graph at minimum?

23
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:44,170
And the second question is, conversely if a graph can be colored with at most k colors,

24
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:47,020
how big can the largest clique in the graph be?

25
00:01:47,020 --> 99:59:59,999
