00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,044
So now let us see, well, how we can do some simple, real-time analytics.

2
00:00:03,044 --> 00:00:06,084
I thought I'd walk through some simple examples,

3
00:00:06,084 --> 00:00:08,280
how we can do real-time analytics.

4
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:09,370
So there you go.

5
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:10,205
Our Louie is there.

6
00:00:10,205 --> 00:00:14,880
[LAUGH] And of course, there's there's boy's boss.

7
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:21,820
And his boss says, like I need a real-time dashboard of the tweets

8
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:28,244
mentioning these media sites and nytimes.comm cnn.com and usatoday.com.

9
00:00:28,244 --> 00:00:31,510
So, so how do you go, guys go about doing these things?

10
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:34,680
It's a really simple problem and it has to be done in real time.

11
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:38,050
So what is the simplest approach you can go about doing this?
