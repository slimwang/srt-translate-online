00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:03,630
Let's talk a bit about
the Icicles project architecture.

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:06,870
By which I mean the classes
that will make up Icicles.

3
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:08,770
First, we have IciclesGame,

4
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:12,110
which is our application listener,
the entry point into our code.

5
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:16,980
IciclesGame will delegate its
application listener callbacks to one of

6
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:18,650
two screens.

7
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:22,330
DifficultyScreen,, which allows the user
to select the difficulty of a game.

8
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:26,815
And IcicleScreen,
which contains the actual gameplay.

9
00:00:26,815 --> 00:00:31,370
IciclesScreen uses two other classes
to hold the state of the game world.

10
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:35,710
There's Player, which handles the
position of the little stick figure down

11
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:39,330
at the bottom of the screen and
also manages user input.

12
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:43,670
And then, there's Icicles, which manages
the position of all the icicles.

13
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:49,280
Icicles itself, is basically, a
collection of a bunch of icicle objects.

14
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:54,110
Finally, we'll be very careful to keep
all constants in their own class.

15
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:55,940
There's two reasons for this.

16
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:59,420
The first is that when constants
are spread all over the place,

17
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:03,920
it becomes incredibly frustrating to
find the number that you want to tweak.

18
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,460
If you want to change, for instance, how
fast the icicles drop, you might need to

19
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:10,730
drill down into IciclesGame, and
then go find an IciclesScreen, and

20
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:13,760
maybe it's in Icicles,
maybe it's in the Icicle singular class.

21
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,290
Who knows where it is?

22
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:18,840
We'll just keep all of those
constants in their own class.

23
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:22,330
Even more important, is the fact that
when you develop games in a professional

24
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:26,250
context, you're often building
a platform that allows artists and

25
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:28,290
designers to easily
slot in their content.

26
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:33,240
You need to design your game in such
a way that your game designer can

27
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:36,290
add a new weapon, or
change some balance easily.

28
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:40,990
Or your artist can swap out some art
assets, all without needing your help.

29
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:44,210
Rigorously using a constants class
is a baby step in this direction.
