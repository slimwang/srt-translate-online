1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,000
Now let me actually have
you play around and

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,090
generate another simple way of encoding
the direction and intensity of lights.

3
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:09,985
Again, three different examples,

4
00:00:09,985 --> 00:00:14,400
basically select which rst will
be highlighted for 2 and 3.

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,690
And I'll tell you what rst is.

6
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:18,495
What we're going to do is we're
going to focus in onto this region.

7
00:00:18,495 --> 00:00:22,011
And of course, any ray of light in
this thing is basically coming in.

8
00:00:22,011 --> 00:00:25,963
So if you notice in this form I
basically created a bunch of small

9
00:00:25,963 --> 00:00:28,583
pinholes within this whole system here.

10
00:00:28,583 --> 00:00:32,137
There's a lens, but down here,
after the light goes through the lens,

11
00:00:32,137 --> 00:00:34,657
I've created a bunch of pinhole sensors,
right?

12
00:00:34,657 --> 00:00:38,250
Smaller pinholes, and here I'm just
showing you an example of three.

13
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:41,750
Any light goes through this
pinhole will hit this one here,

14
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:45,910
and this one will go hit there, and
the straight one is going in the middle.

15
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:49,900
We will end each one of these pin
holes create three different regions,

16
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:51,380
r, s and t.

17
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:52,070
Right?

18
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:56,050
So of course in this case, when the
light is coming in, it's going through

19
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:59,360
the pin hole, the straight line
is straight, going straight to s,

20
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:02,520
this one is coming and hitting r, and
this one is coming and hitting t.

21
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,560
So let's see what happens in
the case of the first one.

22
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:08,765
I have the object at the right distance,
and

23
00:01:08,765 --> 00:01:12,830
here I've just kind of color-coded
the lines red, green and blue.

24
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:16,760
Not to imply the red, green and
blue channels, just to differentiate it.

25
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:20,130
When it hits, basically, this instance,
you notice what's happening.

26
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:21,650
Now of course, to help us,

27
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:25,510
we can create a small decoding
platform out here, r, s, and t.

28
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:28,320
So here, of course,
this red one is coming in,

29
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,200
converging to the blue point,
and hitting this point.

30
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:36,680
Looking at this, this basically
suggests that red should be t.

31
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,630
The green one of course
is s as it should be.

32
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:41,340
And the blue one is r.

33
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:44,180
So, here in basically,
depending on where we are,

34
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:48,790
we are able to create a decoding in
this simple three by three grid,

35
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:50,740
to figure out where different
light sources are coming in.

36
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:54,390
Again, these are not red green and blue,
I'm just showing you rays of light.

37
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:57,450
So, for these two I would actually
have the same thing right?

38
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:00,130
Except this time around
the rays of light are not

39
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:02,370
converging to the same point.

40
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:04,530
Remember the previous
two experiments we did.

41
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:06,800
And for the far object, same thing.

42
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:11,760
Simply put, I want you to now fill
out the r, s, and t for this, and

43
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,170
for this, as to which ones would
be the ones highlighted for

44
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:18,190
the red light, the blue light and
the green light.

45
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:21,490
Just fill out the regions correctly, and
I will show you the answer in a bit.
