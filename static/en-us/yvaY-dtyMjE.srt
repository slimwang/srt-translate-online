00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,758
Because this project has multiple classes, I have to select the one that I

2
00:00:03,758 --> 00:00:08,961
want. And now, I can scroll through in the usual way and see the methods of the

3
00:00:08,961 --> 00:00:13,668
rectangle class. But I want to go a little bit above that and here you see a

4
00:00:13,668 --> 00:00:18,520
summary of the constructors. There are two constructors, the first one takes no

5
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:23,296
arguments and constructs an empty rectangle. The second one takes four

6
00:00:23,296 --> 00:00:29,342
arguments. And I can click on it, and I get the detailed description of what

7
00:00:29,342 --> 00:00:36,021
each of the arguments are. To construct objects in a Java program, you also use

8
00:00:36,021 --> 00:00:42,130
the new syntax. Let's have a look. Over here, you see a variable whose name is

9
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:47,872
box, whose type is rectangle. And the keyword new tells us to make a new

10
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:54,489
rectangle with these values for the construction. Now you know all the details

11
00:00:54,489 --> 00:00:57,145
about construcitng objects.
