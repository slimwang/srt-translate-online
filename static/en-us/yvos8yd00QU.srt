1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,610
So here's the app you're going to be
building over the next few minutes.

2
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:06,280
It has a sign in button, a sign out
button and a revoke access button.

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:08,910
Right now, the sign out and
the revoke access are grayed out,

4
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:12,340
because we're not signed in and
the sign in button is available.

5
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:13,160
So if I touch that,

6
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:15,890
the first thing that will happen
is I get this consent screen.

7
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:17,890
Remember earlier in
the developer's console,

8
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:21,130
you saw the ability to set up
the consent screen and this is it.

9
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:25,010
So the consent screen, because I'm
using profile scope, is just saying.

10
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:28,800
This application would like to view
your basic profile information.

11
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,729
So if I touch OK,
it now continues and it signs in, and

12
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:36,380
as you can see it's signed in to
Google+ as me, Lawrence Maroney.

13
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:41,070
It's been able to take my name out
of my ID so it can present it here.

14
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:45,515
If I sign out you'll see that we're now
signed out again, and if I sign in,

15
00:00:45,515 --> 00:00:48,970
Idon't get the consent screen anymore
because I've already accepted it,

16
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:51,840
and given my app access
to profile scope.

17
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,040
But I can revoke that by touching
the Revoke Access button.

18
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,310
So now that I've touched that,

19
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:59,560
I've signed out again, as the Sign Out
button has been grayed out,

20
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:03,210
the Revoke Access button has been grayed
out, but the Sign In button's available.

21
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:04,519
So if I touch that,

22
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:08,570
I new get the consent screen again
because I previously revoked access.

23
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:12,270
And, then if I go okay again, now I'm
signed in and its signed in as me.

24
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:15,370
Now, how does this map to methods and
overrides in your app?

25
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:16,530
Lets take a look how to do that.
