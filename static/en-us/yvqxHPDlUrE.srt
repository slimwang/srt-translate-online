1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:06,200
So what are some of the challenges
when it comes to the CFAA or the DMCA?

2
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:10,400
The laws that we just talked
about related to fraud abuse and

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,450
protection of distal objects.

4
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:16,370
First of all, enforcement is
actually quite challenging.

5
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:20,390
It's difficult for a number of reason
first of all, attribution is hard.

6
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:25,110
How exactly do you know that this is
the person who was responsible for

7
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:27,620
something fraudulent that was done?

8
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:33,160
We know that a request or data may
have flowed to a certain computer,

9
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:35,730
but there may be malware
sitting on that computer.

10
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:40,610
It may not be any fault of the person
who owns that computer, it could be some

11
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:44,370
bot that's under the control of somebody
else who's actually doing that.

12
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:49,250
So how exactly do you attribute
a certain illegal activity,

13
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:51,270
or action to a person?

14
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:55,510
And what makes this really even harder

15
00:00:55,510 --> 00:01:00,442
is the fact that the internet
has no national boundaries.

16
00:01:00,442 --> 00:01:04,940
So that international nature or the
transnational nature of the internet,

17
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:08,070
of course presents another
set of challenges.

18
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:12,880
Finally, I think we had
a quiz question talking about

19
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:17,410
have the various laws related
to computer fraud done any good?

20
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:20,510
Have they reduced cyber crime or
has cyber crime gone up?

21
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:25,960
Well one of the challenges that we,
making laws is a slow process.

22
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:29,950
And cyber criminals can
basically stay ahead of it.

23
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:32,760
The criminal ecosystem
can keep evolving.

24
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:36,000
They can work around the legal
safeguards we put in place.

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,490
Though and that can happen very rapidly,
much faster than our ability

26
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:46,520
to put laws in place and
find ways to enforce them,

27
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:49,330
get people in front of judges and
courts and things like that.

28
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:53,550
So there have been cases
we're going to look at a few,

29
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:56,130
but obviously one of the challenges.

30
00:01:56,130 --> 00:02:00,590
How do you stay current with what is
going on in the cyber criminal world?
