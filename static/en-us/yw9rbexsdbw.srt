00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:04,350
Today we'll wrap up this course. It's been a fun journey. But like all journeys,

2
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:08,150
this one too must come to an end. The goal for today's lesson is to

3
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:11,820
tie together some of the big things we have been discussing, and

4
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,860
to point to some of the other big ideas out there in the community.

5
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:19,630
We'll start by revisiting the high level structure of the course.

6
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:21,930
Then we'll go through some of recurrent patterns and

7
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:25,078
principles we've encountered throughout the course. Finally,

8
00:00:25,078 --> 00:00:28,720
we'll talk about all the broader impacts and applications of knowledge based AI.
