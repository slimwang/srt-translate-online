00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:04,080
In this session we saw two
important Ruby data structures,

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,410
the array and the hash.

3
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:08,530
Arrays are ordered lists of data,

4
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:11,080
while hashes is our
collections of key value pairs.

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,565
We'll use these two structures in
pretty much everything we tackle from

6
00:00:15,565 --> 00:00:16,200
here on out.

7
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:20,890
It's also very common to use them
together, storing arrays and

8
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:23,810
hashes or hashes and arrays.

9
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:26,780
We'll see an example of
this in our next project

10
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:30,820
where we analyze some complex product
sales data for a fictitious company.
