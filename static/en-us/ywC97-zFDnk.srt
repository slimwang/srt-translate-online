1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,070
But first, let's actually just
have a small quiz to kind of make

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:05,842
sure that you folks are following
what's going on here.

3
00:00:05,842 --> 00:00:10,050
Again, notice this video is the one that
was shown in the previous video too.

4
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:14,990
It's basically a camera that's
being panned from right to left.

5
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:18,640
In this case, of course you can
imagine it wasn't a tripod and

6
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,230
mostly it's a simple pan.

7
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:21,130
And it's slowly done.

8
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:25,758
What we are interested in is using
this to generate a panorama,

9
00:00:25,758 --> 00:00:29,210
but at the same time,
of course not getting carried

10
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:33,880
away by actually trying to do things
like matching all of the moving parts.

11
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:35,010
So here's a question for you.

12
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:37,430
I have various ways of
building panoramas, right?

13
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:41,260
I can actually have a small
part of a frame and

14
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:45,430
I could then basically ask the question,
how can I build a panorama?

15
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:48,510
In this case, I have a video,
which basically would mean I would take

16
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:52,380
all of the video frames, and register
and align them to generate a panorama.

17
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:55,500
So that would mean is,
I would take this video and

18
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,490
as it's moving from right to left,

19
00:00:57,490 --> 00:01:03,300
I will take all of the frames from this
one and generate a panorama like this.

20
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:06,630
Is that a legitimate way
of doing panorama building?

21
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:08,260
Or is this the other method?

22
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:10,460
And in fact,
this is the method you may recall again,

23
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:12,420
that we may have been playing around.

24
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:15,080
That is, I take basically
from all of the video frame.

25
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,630
Just select six different frames.

26
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:18,930
Of course, I'm talking about six.

27
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:20,750
It could be many more.

28
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:24,880
And again, remember all of the things we
may recall again from panorama building.

29
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:29,910
So, the question for you is, which of
these two methods is legitimate method

30
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:33,700
to generate panorama,
also could the answer be, both?
