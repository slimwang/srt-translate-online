1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,610
Let's take a look at each of
the choices that are given.

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:06,400
The first statement is not correct.

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:11,450
The Linux O of 1 scheduler was O of
1 because it took constant amount of

4
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:16,500
time to select and
schedule a task regardless of the load.

5
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:21,360
The second statement is sort of correct
in the sense that as long as there

6
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:25,930
were continuously arriving higher
priority tasks, it was possible for

7
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:30,340
the low priority tasks to keep waiting
an unpredictable amount of time and

8
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:33,170
possibly indefinitely and
therefore, starve.

9
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:37,540
But this was really not the main
reason why the scheduler was replaced.

10
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:39,810
The final choice was the main reason.

11
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:43,480
Recall that we said that the common
work, workloads were becoming

12
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:48,300
much more and more interactive and
were demanding high predictability.

13
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:52,150
In the 01 scheduler with the active and
expired list,

14
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:56,100
once the task was moved to the expired
list, it had to wait there until

15
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:00,930
all of the low priority tasks
consumed their entire time quantum.

16
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:05,720
For a very long time Linus Torvalds
resisted integrating a scheduler that

17
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:11,680
would address the needs of the small
interactive tasks in the Linux kernel.

18
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,750
His rational was that Linux was supposed
to be a general purpose operating system

19
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:20,970
and should not necessarily be addressing
any of the needs of some more real

20
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:23,270
time or more interactive tasks.

21
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:26,930
And therefore he liked the simplicity
of the offline scheduler.

22
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:30,670
However, as the general purpose
work loads began to change,

23
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:35,540
then a general purpose operating system
like Linux, have to really incorporate

24
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:39,370
a scheduler that would address the needs
of those general purpose workloads and

25
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:41,210
CFS was really meeting those needs.
