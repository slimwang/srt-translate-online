1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:04,130
Let's try and apply this equation to bring an object into focus.

2
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:07,010
Here's our lens, and image plane.

3
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:09,470
Now say we have an object point p,

4
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:12,930
that gets projected onto the image plane at point p prime.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,350
Now let's complete the pin lens diagram.

6
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:21,200
We know that, rays of light from p that are parallel to the principle axis after

7
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:28,150
refraction, cross the principle axis at a point that is focal length away.

8
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:30,320
So that distance is f.

9
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,780
Similarly on the other side, that is also f.

10
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:37,590
The distance of the object from the lens is z.

11
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:42,620
And the distance between the image plane and the lens is z prime.

12
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:46,770
Let's say the focal length f is 50 millimeters.

13
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:52,170
Now consider two scenarios, one where the object is one meter away, and

14
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:55,170
second where the object is two meters away.

15
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:59,820
At what corresponding values of z prime would the object be in focus?

16
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:03,630
Enter your answers in the boxes provided in millimeters with up to

17
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:05,330
two decimal places of precision.
