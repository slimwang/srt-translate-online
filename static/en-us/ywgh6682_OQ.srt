When convolving a filter with an impulse image,

2
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:06,680
we get back the filter as a result, right?

3
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:10,370
So in other words, by doing the convolution, we, we flipped it, and

4
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:11,100
then we rotate it and

5
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:16,570
it flips again, so I take an impulse, and I convolve it with H, I get back H.

6
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:19,660
All right, well then, how about the following?

7
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:24,530
If we convolve an image with an impulse, what would we get?

8
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:28,390
Well, A, a blurred version of the image.

9
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:31,500
B, the original image.

10
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:34,210
C, a shifted version of the original image.

11
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:35,690
And D, you have no idea.
