1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
All right. Let me show you how the Template works, real quick.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I've got this file called front.html.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
It's currently blank.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I'm going to type in some HTML.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
We've got our DOCTYPE--you know--

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
our , our /ascii/,

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
We've got our here,

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
and inside our we've got an tag,

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
which is just--basically, it's called a HEADER1.

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
It draws your text

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
bold, a little larger--

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
with a little margin around it, and that's it.

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
So that's in this file called front.html.

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
If we had opened this in our browser,

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
it would just print the words: /ascii/

16
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
and let's go ahead and instead of loading this in our browser,

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
return it from our file here.

18
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Instead of calling self.write,

19
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I've changed this to self.render("front.html"]

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
and let's give this a whirl.

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Okay. Here we are in our browser--I've reloaded the page.

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
We can see my title is set to /ascii/

23
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
and we've got the text, /ascii/, up here.

24
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
The slash is just kind of a joke.

25
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
That's how Fortran does their titles and stuff.

26
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
In our Editor, you can see--we just called the

27
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
self.render function, which is defined here.

28
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
All that does is it calls

29
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
render_str on this Template name--

30
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
this file name which render_str loads,

31
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
renders--and then we write.

32
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Okay. So, simple enough--that'll just save some time.

33
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
It's a little bit more convenient to edit HTML

34
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
as HTML--especially if you're editor is going to help you--

35
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
than to have a big string in the middle of your Python file.

36
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
All right. Let's go over to our HTML,

37
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
and the first thing we want to add is our form.

38
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
So the method="post"

39
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
and we're not going to define an action; we're just going to

40
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
submit to ourselves, which is something we've done a lot.

41
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
So I've added one input field.

42
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
We're going to call it "title"--

43
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
and I'm going to include "title" in a little here,

44
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
just to put it on a new line,

45
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
and then it's going to be an

46
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
and this is going to be for the title of our image.

47
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Let's go ahead--and I closed the tag.

48
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm going to Save the file, and let's load it in our Browser

49
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
to make sure everything's working.

50
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Okay. Here I am in the browser,

51
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
and I reload and now I have my title string

52
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
and a box I can type in.

53
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Okay. All is well.

54
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Let's add the next form field

55
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
for inputting the art from the user.

56
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
So we're going to call this "art",

57
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
and let's interrupt this for a quick quiz.

58
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Which is the most appropriate form element for inputting ascii art?

59
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Is it ,

60
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
a ,

61
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
a element,

62
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
or ?
