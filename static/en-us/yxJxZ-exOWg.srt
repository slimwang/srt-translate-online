00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,930
What if I want to rearrange my friends list, based on who I talked to last.

2
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:08,395
I'll add a method, talkTo, which takes a friend, which, wherever they are on

3
00:00:08,395 --> 00:00:14,222
the list, will take them, and move them up to the front of the list. There's

4
00:00:14,222 --> 00:00:17,556
one odd situation we would need to think about. What should happen if the given

5
00:00:17,556 --> 00:00:20,800
person isn't a friend? To decide this, we would need to think about this

6
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,330
situation we're modeling. Do you add every person you talk to, as a friend?

7
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:28,410
That would be pretty cool. We'd all have a lot of friends, but I think that's

8
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:32,046
not realistic. So in this case, let's say if you talked to somebody who isn't a

9
00:00:32,046 --> 00:00:37,014
friend at all yet, nothing changes. How would you implement the talkTo method?
