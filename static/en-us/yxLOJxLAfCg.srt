00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The fast module exponentiation technique used in lecture suffers from an important security flaw.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
The time it takes to execute depends on the value of the power,

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
which may be secret.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
This means an attacker who can measure precisely how long encryption takes

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
can learn something about this key.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Assuming a simple model of computation,

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
where modulus and multiplication by 1 or 2 is free, which costs essentially nothing,

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
but all other multiplications cost 1 unit of time,

9
00:00:27,000 --> 99:59:59,999
which of the following module exponentiations would take the longest?
