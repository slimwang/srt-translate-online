00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,880
In the first lesson, we talked
about how to set up an experiment

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:08,180
by identifying the variables and
setting up treatment and control groups.

3
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:10,960
In this problem,
you'll need to figure out whether or

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,940
not one of your customers clicked
on the link to download the App.

5
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:17,980
Let's apply what you've
learned to your new task.

6
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:21,990
The target variable, in this experiment,
is whether or not an individual clicked

7
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:24,630
on the link to visit the App and
loyalty information page.

8
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:27,640
This is a binary target, yes or no.

9
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:31,910
The experiment will compare the
difference in the click-through rate for

10
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:34,192
the control and treatment groups.

11
00:00:34,192 --> 00:00:37,245
A click-through rate measures
the percentage of people that click

12
00:00:37,245 --> 00:00:38,377
on a link or visit a page.

13
00:00:38,377 --> 00:00:39,828
[BLANK_AUDIO]

14
00:00:39,828 --> 00:00:43,480
The treatment variable is
which Web page they see.

15
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:45,450
The treatment group will
see the modified page,

16
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:48,030
and the control group will
see the original page.

17
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:52,910
Control variables and random
experiments are used to ensure that

18
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:57,250
both the treatment and control groups
are representative of the population.

19
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:58,800
This helps give confidence,

20
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,740
that if the change were applied
to the entire population

21
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:05,360
you could expect to see the same results
that you observe in the experiment.
