1
00:00:00,598 --> 00:00:02,367
Within the forecast fragment class,

2
00:00:02,367 --> 00:00:04,569
when the refresh menu item is selected,

3
00:00:04,569 --> 00:00:06,430
we read from SharedPreferences.

4
00:00:06,518 --> 00:00:08,294
Since they are key-value pairs,

5
00:00:08,294 --> 00:00:11,817
we get their value stored 
for the location key.

6
00:00:11,817 --> 00:00:13,158
If there's no value stored

7
00:00:13,158 --> 00:00:15,684
then we fall back 
to the default location.

8
00:00:16,215 --> 00:00:19,132
Then we pass the location 
into the fetch weather task.
