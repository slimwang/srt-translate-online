00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:07,680
Here are the solutions for 10, 1, and 9x squared minus 36x plus 37. Great

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,219
solving, if you got all three of these correct. Now, if you only got one or two

3
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:15,354
of these right, that's okay, too. These are not the easiest problems, and I'm

4
00:00:15,354 --> 00:00:19,789
sure you'll get it with more practice. To find f of g of 1, we first need to

5
00:00:19,789 --> 00:00:25,942
find the g of 1. So, when 1 is the input for g, we should get an output of

6
00:00:25,942 --> 00:00:33,150
negative 2. We get that simply by letting x equal positive 1. So, now, that we

7
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:39,445
know g of 1 equals negative 2, we just need to find f of negative 2. We use

8
00:00:39,445 --> 00:00:45,346
negative 2 as the input for f. If we let x equal negative 2 for this function,

9
00:00:45,346 --> 00:00:50,757
here and here, then we can see that we'll get a total sum of 10. Negative 2

10
00:00:50,757 --> 00:00:56,542
squared is positive 4. Negative 2 times negative 2 is positive 4, which makes

11
00:00:56,542 --> 00:01:03,222
8, plus another 2 equals 10. This is how we solve the first problem. And we can

12
00:01:03,222 --> 00:01:08,740
use the same approach to tackle this problem, f of g of 2. Letting the x value

13
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:14,692
equal 2 here, we get a g of 2 equal to 1. So we know that the output of g is 1

14
00:01:14,692 --> 00:01:21,599
when x equals 2, so I can replace this g of 2 with the value 1. Now we just

15
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:26,956
need to find f of 1. I'm letting the output of g when x equals 2, now be the

16
00:01:26,956 --> 00:01:33,018
input for f. Negative 2 and positive 2 sum to zero. So then I just have 1

17
00:01:33,018 --> 00:01:38,880
squared, which equals positive 1. Now, we've done two calculations for f of g.

18
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,360
But it would be so much nicer and easier if we just had one function to work

19
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:48,648
with. An f of g of x function. So to find this function, we simply take g of x,

20
00:01:48,648 --> 00:01:54,944
and we plug it in anywhere we see an x and f. So notice that here and here,

21
00:01:54,944 --> 00:02:01,190
I've left spots for the x. We have something squared, minus 2 times something,

22
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:06,052
plus 2. We're going to take g of x, which is 3x minus 5, and use that as our

23
00:02:06,052 --> 00:02:13,126
input. This is how we find a composition f of g of x. We have x as our

24
00:02:13,126 --> 00:02:18,755
variable, and we finding the output by plugging in g of x into this function.

25
00:02:18,755 --> 00:02:25,886
Squaring this binomial, we get 9x squared minus 30x plus 25. Then we'll

26
00:02:25,886 --> 00:02:30,548
distribute this negative 2 to get negative 6x plus 10, and a positive 2 on the

27
00:02:30,548 --> 00:02:37,430
end. There's no like terms with 9x squared, so I'll just list that here. Then

28
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:42,470
we'll combine the like terms of negative 30x and negative 6x to get negative

29
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:51,280
36x. And finally, we'll add 25, 10, and 2, to get positive 37. This is how we

30
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,200
get our entire composite function.
