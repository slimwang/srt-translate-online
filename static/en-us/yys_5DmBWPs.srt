>> Okay,

5
00:00:19,594 --> 00:00:23,108
I think we're ready to add items,
take a look.

6
00:00:23,108 --> 00:00:26,986
Each item that you request from
the store, be it a juicy intsarito or

7
00:00:26,986 --> 00:00:30,796
some delectable cheesy flakes should
be represented as a object in

8
00:00:30,796 --> 00:00:34,320
the Firebase Database just
like a shopping list is.

9
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,050
This is because items are going to have
a few things associated with them.

10
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:41,330
For example, items will have names,
they'll also have an owner for

11
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:43,100
who requested the item.

12
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:46,010
Eventually I think we'll also want to
store things like whether the item

13
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:48,240
has been bought and who bought the item.

14
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:54,880
The point is that an item like a
shopping list lends itself to be a Pojo.

15
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:57,955
So first things first,
you're going to make a pojo for an item.

16
00:00:57,955 --> 00:01:00,660
Then you'll need to update
the UI to both create items and

17
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:02,270
display lists of them.

18
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:03,741
We'll just start by making the Pojo.

19
00:01:03,741 --> 00:01:06,310
It should contain these two properties.

20
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:08,740
And for owner, we'll just stick
with the string anonymous owner,

21
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:10,870
like we've been doing for
the shopping lists.

22
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:14,330
Remember to follow all of the rules for
making Pojos that you learned before.

23
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:17,917
I provided a link to the material about
making Pojos in the instructor notes,

24
00:01:17,917 --> 00:01:18,645
if you need it.

25
00:01:18,645 --> 00:01:20,440
When you're done,
go ahead and click here.
