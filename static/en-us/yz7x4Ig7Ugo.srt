1
00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:04,078
When we transformed f of x equals 4 over x minus 1 plus 1 into a single

2
00:00:04,078 --> 00:00:08,888
fraction, by converting this 1 to have the same denominator as the first term,

3
00:00:08,888 --> 00:00:15,705
we end up with, x plus 3 over x minus 1. So, you can see that yes, in fact,

4
00:00:15,705 --> 00:00:19,791
this is a rational function, since both of these are polynomials.
