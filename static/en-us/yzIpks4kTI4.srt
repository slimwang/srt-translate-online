1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:04,220
The course that you're taking is
about native JavaScript promises.

2
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:07,370
They started showing up in
browsers around the end of 2014,

3
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:12,260
but polyfills for promises have been
around for much longer actually.

4
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:15,580
JQuery, which is obviously
a very popular library,

5
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:19,710
implements its own version of promises,
but they have some serious issues.

6
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:23,120
So I definitely recommend reading up
on them in the instructor notes if you

7
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,390
want to use them.

8
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:27,940
The first version of Angular
uses Q style promises.

9
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:30,400
These are mostly the same
as native promises, but

10
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,390
have some slight differences.

11
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:33,340
Angular 2,

12
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:37,920
however, will actually be taking
advantage of native JavaScript promises.

13
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,250
Once again, check the links in
the instructor notes to learn more.

14
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:45,960
As of this filming right now in December
of 2015, native promises are safe

15
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,470
to use with every major browser, except
for Internet Explorer and Opera Mini.

16
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:52,940
You'll need to make sure that
you include a polyfill or

17
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:56,420
some other kind of fall-back
on your production sites.

18
00:00:56,420 --> 00:01:00,240
There are some new APIs that are also
taking advantage of promises.

19
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:03,040
For instance,
they're the recommended strategy for

20
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:06,160
interacting with the new
service worker API.

21
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:08,670
Service workers
are a total game changer.

22
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:12,270
They allow you to add a powerful
layer of control between your app and

23
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:16,540
the network, and that means that you can
actually create apps that work offline.

24
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:17,820
Seriously, it's amazing.

25
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:20,350
And you should check the instructor
notes to learn more.

26
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:24,920
In the next quiz you'll be using
another new API called the Fetch API.

27
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:30,840
It uses native promises to
simplify xml http requests.

28
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,870
That's really hard to say.

29
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:33,950
Substantially.

30
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:35,130
So let's go ahead and do it.
