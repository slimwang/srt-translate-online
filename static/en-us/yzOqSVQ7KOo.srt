1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:04,390
How about some example, because RANSAC is actually used quite a bit.

2
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:06,689
So you guys have already seen this one, right.

3
00:00:06,689 --> 00:00:08,750
So here's RANSAC for recognition.

4
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:10,580
This again is from David Lowe's work.

5
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:13,700
And what you can see here is there are a whole bunch of

6
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:19,400
matches that were correct, but here's one, for example that was not correct.

7
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:20,950
So if we were just doing, say,

8
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:25,170
an affine transform, how many matches do you need to do an affine transform?

9
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:25,900
Let's see.

10
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:27,030
One for translation, two for

11
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:31,490
similarity, four for homography, so affine is three.

12
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:32,380
I think they're doing affine here.

13
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:34,130
I don't think they're doing full perspective.

14
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:37,220
So basically, you keep randomly picking three points.

15
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:39,000
Find the affined deformation.

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,620
And when you happen to pick this one, the correct one,

17
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:47,080
all of these points, you can't even see that I'm drawing all of these things but

18
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:50,640
I am, all of those points become inliers.

19
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:57,853
If you happen to pick this point match, this point match, and

20
00:00:57,853 --> 00:01:02,140
this point match, you would have said that this box kind of landed here maybe.

21
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:04,879
And then you would compute the inliers and it would be hardly any.

22
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:07,580
And that's why RANSAC works for the recognition.

23
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:09,270
We talked about the fundamental matrix.

24
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:13,310
Okay. So here, I, these are actually images that I showed you,

25
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:18,610
again I think comes from of Harris corners detected on two different images.

26
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:19,480
All right.

27
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:23,490
And then we do the putative matches and instead of drawing across,

28
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:26,640
which can be really ugly, we did something else that's ugly.

29
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,780
And again I want to thank Frank Dellaert who stole this slide from

30
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:31,110
somebody else, and I stole it from him.

31
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:33,710
So, whoever's annoyed out there, go yell at Frank.

32
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:39,340
The punitive matches are drawn on this picture,

33
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:43,080
instead of trying to draw them across I'm just sort of showing,

34
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:46,160
this is the belief about how it thinks the points moved.

35
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,490
And remember this is fundamental matrix.

36
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:50,380
I've got one camera, and I've got another camera, and

37
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:52,820
it's a question of how the points will move in the image.

38
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:57,580
Well, they should all move smoothly, according to the epipolar constraint.

39
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:58,670
Remember the epipolar constraint?

40
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:01,770
How I've got two views, I could, if you knew the calibration,

41
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:04,850
I could tell you the lines along which they have to move.

42
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:08,840
So these would all be moving along these epipolar lines.

43
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:12,400
But what you can see here is that a lot of these things don't seem lined up.

44
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,580
So here we have 188 putative matches done,

45
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:18,090
in this particular case, through cross-correlation.

46
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:20,090
When you run RANSAC, well,

47
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:24,290
now you find a fundamental matrix that has selected out these points.

48
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:30,090
And you see how they all are aligned up nicely, and there were 99 inliers.

49
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:31,460
And here are these points.

50
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:34,020
And you see how they are all lined up not so

51
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:37,260
nicely, like not at all, because they're just outliers.

52
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:38,970
Their matches were just noise.

53
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:42,300
So, this is a case where 50%, more or

54
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:45,470
less, of the points were matches were wrong.

55
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:47,510
And yet RANSAC can handle that.

56
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:49,130
Here's an example from robotics.

57
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:52,210
One of the things these days people do a lot of is use point clouds.

58
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:55,520
Point clouds are recovered from some form of 3D sensing.

59
00:02:55,520 --> 00:03:00,150
Whether it's stereo or these days a lot of people use kinect-like sensors.

60
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:05,250
And what you have here is an image from a set of depth points and you'll notice

61
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:11,340
that the bunch of these objects have been colored as different things.

62
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:15,070
But notice the table is not colored.

63
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:19,519
The table has been removed from the objects.

64
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:22,730
You might have thought the objects were removed from the table.

65
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:23,300
Not really.

66
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:25,200
The table was removed from the objects.

67
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,030
How was it done?

68
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,990
What's the shape of a table?

69
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:30,250
It's a plane.

70
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:33,440
So if you know your model is a plane you say I'm going to pick some points to

71
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,660
find a plane, see how many points lie on that plane.

72
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:40,340
If a lot of points lie on the plane maybe that's a real plane.

73
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:43,120
That's how they found the table, they used RANSAC.

74
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,530
Here's another example, this is actually work done by a student of mine.

75
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:50,950
He was doing some work for a robot seeing objects on a table and

76
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:54,230
pushing them around in order to determine how many objects were really there.

77
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:59,350
But the first thing he had to do was separate the objects from the table.

78
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:00,440
How did he do that?

79
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,060
RANSAC.

80
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:02,560
Find the table.

81
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,730
Here's a video stolen off of YouTube,

82
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:11,950
of somebody doing real time object segmentation off of a plane.

83
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:13,930
And, so you can see it runs easily,

84
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:18,040
effectively, and again they're using RANSAC to define the plane
