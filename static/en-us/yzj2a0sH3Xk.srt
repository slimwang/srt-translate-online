1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,520
The correct answer here is 3 to the power of N/2

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:08,600
because if you look at this tree, it starts out here at this level, at the first level,

3
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:11,760
and it has 0 assignments that it's considering.

4
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:17,910
At level 1 it's considering 3 possible assignments, so it triples at each time.

5
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:20,380
At level 2 it's considering 9.

6
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:24,060
At level 3 it will be considering 27 and so on and so on and so on.

7
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:29,590
For level X it's considering 3 to the power of X different possibilities.

8
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:33,960
The maximum level is N/2, so it's 3 to the power of N/2.

9
00:00:33,960 --> 99:59:59,999
So the correct solution here is 3 to the power of N/2.
