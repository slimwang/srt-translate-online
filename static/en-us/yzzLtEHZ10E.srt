00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:01,100
As the course continues,

2
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:04,118
you'll have a chance to practice
by working on this blog.

3
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:09,610
Which right now is pretty ugly and
pretty slow.

4
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:12,250
You'll turn it into something that
looks a little bit like this,

5
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:15,310
which is a much more reasonable blog.

6
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:17,770
There's some aspects of
art that go into this.

7
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:21,000
So, your finished version may look
slightly different than ours.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,560
But regardless, it's our goal that
working on this blog will help you

9
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:28,510
easily deliver the highest quality
images with the fewest bytes possible.
