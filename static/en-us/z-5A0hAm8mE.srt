00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,340
It's hard to write a constructor function that is robust against this

2
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:04,480
kind of misuse.

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:05,575
And we don't actually need to.

4
00:00:05,575 --> 00:00:10,940
Object.create sets up the prototype delegation that we need to just like new,

5
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:13,810
but without running the constructor function in the process.

6
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:14,870
Be careful though.

7
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:17,390
Due to a long misunderstanding of JavaScript,

8
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:21,930
this technique has been widely accepted and standardized on for many years.

9
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:25,840
You'll see a lot of misguided documentation out there on reputable sites that

10
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,290
endorses this broken pattern.
