00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:03,904
Let me show you the app we're going
to create in this lesson called

2
00:00:03,904 --> 00:00:04,728
Pitch Perfect.

3
00:00:04,728 --> 00:00:07,097
Pitch Perfect allows you
to record your voice and

4
00:00:07,097 --> 00:00:09,128
play it back with various sound effects.

5
00:00:09,128 --> 00:00:13,940
Including changes to speed,
pitch, and even reverb and echo.

6
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:16,670
Let's run it on the iOS Simulator so
that I can show it to you.

7
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:22,710
The first screen simply prompts
you to record your voice.

8
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:23,543
Hear at Udacity,

9
00:00:23,543 --> 00:00:26,600
we believe that asking questions
is one of the best ways to learn.

10
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:32,280
Judge a man by his questions
rather than his answers.

11
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:38,632
Now you can see Pitch Perfect has moved
us to the playback view where we can

12
00:00:38,632 --> 00:00:42,468
choose to playback my voice using
a variety of different sound effects.

13
00:00:42,468 --> 00:00:46,548
Let's try listening to it really fast.

14
00:00:46,548 --> 00:00:47,629
>> Judge a man by his questions.

15
00:00:47,629 --> 00:00:49,368
Rather than his answers.

16
00:00:49,368 --> 00:00:52,793
>> How about what I would
sound like as Darth Vader.

17
00:00:52,793 --> 00:00:54,373
Judge a man by his questions.

18
00:00:54,373 --> 00:00:57,010
Rather than his answers.

19
00:00:57,010 --> 00:00:58,880
>> This app is a lot
of fun to play with.

20
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:02,430
But more importantly, you will learn key
iOS development concepts along your way.

21
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:05,860
It will also be the start of your
journey as an iOS developer.
