00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:05,906
The answer is this one, y equals 3 to negative x. First of all, we can to tell

2
00:00:05,906 --> 00:00:09,749
that the graph, this one right here, looks just like the one for 1 3rd to the

3
00:00:09,749 --> 00:00:16,059
x. It's the only one on this coordinate plane that's showing exponential decay.

4
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:19,713
We can also see why this equation is equivalent to the one for f of x from

5
00:00:19,713 --> 00:00:26,963
algebra. 3 to the negative x is equal to 3 to the negative 1 to the x. 3 to the

6
00:00:26,963 --> 00:00:33,874
negative 1 is just equal to 1 3rd. So the equations and the graphs for these

7
00:00:33,874 --> 00:00:38,571
two functions are one and the same. They're the same function.
