00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:02,592
Welcome back to Computer Vision.

2
00:00:02,592 --> 00:00:05,497
This lesson is going to start
a whole unit on motion.

3
00:00:05,497 --> 00:00:08,747
Now, in the real world,
things really move, you know,

4
00:00:08,747 --> 00:00:12,290
wind trees blow in the wind,
boats move along the water.

5
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:15,952
A baseball player swings his bat and
typically misses if he wi,

6
00:00:15,952 --> 00:00:17,410
if he plays for the Mets.

7
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:20,470
But, you know,
things are moving all the time and

8
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:22,850
our perception system handles them.

9
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:28,610
In Computer Vision, we also want to deal
with motion, but what's kind of cool is,

10
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:30,636
actually, nothing is moving.

11
00:00:30,636 --> 00:00:33,797
What you're seeing here is
a repeated GIF image, and I've,

12
00:00:33,797 --> 00:00:36,338
I've made it sort of
coarsely sampled actually,

13
00:00:36,338 --> 00:00:39,233
it's from some slides stolen
from some folks listed below.

14
00:00:39,233 --> 00:00:45,680
So that you can see that it's
actually a sequence of static frames.

15
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,830
Okay?
And, you know, of course,

16
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:50,820
the issue is that when we look
at them when they're not so

17
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:55,060
separated in time by quite so
much we see this nice motion.

18
00:00:55,060 --> 00:01:00,160
And what we would like is, that the same
perception of motion that we have,

19
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,398
we'd like to be able give the machine.

20
00:01:01,398 --> 00:01:04,319
We'd like a machine to be able
to understand the notion of

21
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,000
motion, if you will.

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,060
So, when we're going to
talk about motion.

23
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:12,150
Here, we're going to start
talking about video.

24
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:15,800
Now, really, we're just thinking
about a sequence of frames.

25
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,580
And, in fact, a long time ago, we used
to just called them sequences because

26
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:20,760
a camera would go and then a camera
would take another picture.

27
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:23,120
And then, some time later, would take
another picture, another picture.

28
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,853
And the question was, how to use those.

29
00:01:24,853 --> 00:01:29,690
These days, of course, much more
ubiquitous, is a notion of video where

30
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:34,153
a sequence is captured over time,
usually, relatively quickly.

31
00:01:34,153 --> 00:01:39,810
So things can't change a whole lot
from one sequence sample to the next.

32
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:43,710
And usually taken at regular intervals,
whether it's every 30 hertz, 60 hertz,

33
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:47,420
24 hertz, the idea is that
it's at regular intervals.

34
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:51,540
Now, our image is no longer
a function of just space, x and y.

35
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:55,500
But our image is a function of space x,
y, and time, t.

36
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:59,280
So our signal is I of x, y, and t.

37
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,780
But as I said before,

38
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:05,100
sometimes when we describe them as
three dimensional function like this.

39
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:07,804
We tend to think of the, all three
dimensions as being the same, but

40
00:02:07,804 --> 00:02:08,930
they're not.

41
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:11,380
Space is quite different than time, so,

42
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:16,630
if I wearing a nice checkered shirt
instead of this gorgeous green.

43
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:20,620
As I moved in space, you would
see pixels changing very quickly

44
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:22,710
in terms of their
intensity of their color.

45
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:25,520
But, if I were to change
the pixels that quickly in time,

46
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,410
you would essentially see a mess,
you would see all this flickering and

47
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:29,980
things changing very rapidly.

48
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:35,830
So in general, even thought we think of
these as a three dimensional function,

49
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:38,940
remember that time and space are
different in terms of their statistics
