1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:05,230
OK so the first pattern is *S* so

2
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:08,590
that will match anything that
contains a capital letter S.

3
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:12,830
So that includes GiantSquid,
and Squid, and

4
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:18,180
this Queen mp3, but it doesn't include
these which all include a lower case s.

5
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:22,789
You might have noticed that
*S* matches Squid.avi,

6
00:00:22,789 --> 00:00:26,360
even though there's nothing
before the capital S here.

7
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:29,810
Star can match zero characters.

8
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:32,509
So the next pattern is Squid*.

9
00:00:32,509 --> 00:00:35,190
That matches only things that
start with the word Squid.

10
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:39,700
That will be Squid.avi,
but not any of the others.

11
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:42,560
And finally we have this
one with a question mark.

12
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:45,400
Remember question mark
matches a single character.

13
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:51,804
So this will match p-a-s-s-w-d
as well as p-a-s-s-e-d.
