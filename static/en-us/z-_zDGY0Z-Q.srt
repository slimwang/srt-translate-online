00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:03,360
Congratulations, you're now
at the end of the course and

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,730
you should be proud of
how far you've come.

3
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:07,689
I want to take this
time to say thank you.

4
00:00:07,689 --> 00:00:11,260
It's been a joy and a privilege
to share this content with you.

5
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:13,730
In this course we learned
a lot about networking and

6
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:15,310
how to use it in our apps.

7
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:17,970
We started with simple web requests and
built interesting and

8
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:21,870
fun to use apps that gave users
access to data over the network.

9
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:24,860
We also looked at how to design our
networking apps while adhering to

10
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:27,140
the model view controller paradigm.

11
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:30,080
Those are the two key takeaways
I want you to finish with.

12
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:34,140
Making web requests, and doing so
while considering good design.

13
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:36,610
These alone can get you pretty far,
and they'll be crucial for

14
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:39,620
completing on the map,
but I know you can do it.

15
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:42,220
So now it's your turn to go out and
network for yourself.

16
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:44,810
Again, thank you and
always remember, keep learning
