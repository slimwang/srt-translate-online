1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,970
And this was a tricky question.

2
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:02,900
I would pick this one.

3
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:07,020
This one over here is obviously not good because we

4
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:09,110
even misclassifying our existing data.

5
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:12,270
Is on the, these are on the wrong side of the decision surface.

6
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:14,680
So let's take this one out.

7
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:19,560
But the one going vertical here does correctly classify most data points.

8
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:20,735
Except for this one over here.

9
00:00:20,735 --> 00:00:23,930
And also comes very close to the red cross over here.

10
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:26,390
That's something we're going to explore later in this class.

11
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:29,140
But for the time being what you should notice is that what

12
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:32,400
you're machine learning algorithm does it takes in data and

13
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,560
it transforms it into a decision surface.

14
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:36,870
DS.

15
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:39,440
That for all future cases.

16
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:44,160
Can enable you to make a determination of wether it's a red cross or

17
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,270
a blue circle, and that is very powerful.
