1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,670
So you needed to select this element and
change the text.

2
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:07,800
To do that,
you can look at any classes or

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:11,200
IDs that the element might have
by inspecting the element.

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:16,010
Notice that the title is in an h1 tag,
and it has a class of main-title.

5
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:20,490
Now, you might have been tempted
to use the select all method.

6
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:23,800
And if you did then you would've run
into the problem of selecting the text

7
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:28,360
for this H1 tag here, and
this H1 tag down below.

8
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:33,180
Notice that the selection
returns two DOM nodes.

9
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:35,740
Now if you would've just
used the select method,

10
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:40,310
then the first element on the page that
matches the selector syntax is returned.

11
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:42,640
So, in our case, this would work.

12
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,320
The confusion of which items
you might be selecting

13
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:48,210
becomes more of an issue
as your web page grows.

14
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:50,880
The number of elements increases and
the number of class names and

15
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,550
IDs can increase as well.

16
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:56,770
So, to avoid any confusion, it's often
best just to use the most specific

17
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:59,920
selector syntax in your select method.

18
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,550
In our case, the HTML,
H1 tag is okay, but

19
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:07,400
I think the class name selector
works very well in this case.

20
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,580
So, let's use a class of main
title to select our H1 tag.

21
00:01:11,735 --> 00:01:15,185
Finally, we set the text
of the HTML element

22
00:01:15,185 --> 00:01:18,955
by chaining the .txt
method onto the selection.

23
00:01:18,955 --> 00:01:22,385
We pass in the text we'd like
the HTML element to have, and

24
00:01:22,385 --> 00:01:24,365
then we run it in the console.

25
00:01:24,365 --> 00:01:26,995
Now we have our new title for
our main content area.
