1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:04,800
So if this is how the system comes
out of the box, the question here is,

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:09,030
is it violating a design principle for
secure systems?

3
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:10,670
And if it is, which one that is.

4
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:16,238
So depending on your choice, one or
both, you want to check those.
