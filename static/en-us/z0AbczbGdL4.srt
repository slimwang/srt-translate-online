1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,135
Let's look at this first case. If I choose a number like 3, I get the absolute

2
00:00:04,147 --> 00:00:08,400
value of 3 equal to the absolute value of 3. The distance of these numbers from

3
00:00:08,412 --> 00:00:12,380
zero are both 3, so that one works. If I make the second one negative 3, well,

4
00:00:12,392 --> 00:00:16,260
the absolute value is still 3. The distance of these numbers from zero is 3.

5
00:00:16,357 --> 00:00:20,610
This one is correct and this one is also correct. We just switch the sides that

6
00:00:20,622 --> 00:00:24,843
the absolute values are on. And finally, if we had both negative numbers, well,

7
00:00:24,937 --> 00:00:28,681
that would be correct as well. The distance of negative 3 from zero is 3. So,

8
00:00:28,693 --> 00:00:32,786
all these cases are true. We're going to use this information to figure out how

9
00:00:32,798 --> 00:00:35,259
to solve this problem. Let's take a closer look.
