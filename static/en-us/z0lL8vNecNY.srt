1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:02,468
We showed this picture already, right?

2
00:00:02,468 --> 00:00:07,960
This is a picture of the tracking
of Andrew Black's daughter.

3
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:10,824
And, the first question
is what is the state?

4
00:00:10,824 --> 00:00:11,850
All right.

5
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:15,210
And the state, or
the object that was to be tracked,

6
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:19,270
was a hand initialized
contour of the head.

7
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:22,920
On the left here you see
a bunch of contours.

8
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:23,880
Okay?
In fact,

9
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:26,930
there's even one that's up here,
all right?

10
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:30,980
Those contours are the contours
represented by each or

11
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:34,060
many of the particles,
the top particles, right?

12
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:37,350
And so, for example, you can
actually talk about the mean state

13
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:40,460
as being the sort of
average of the particles.

14
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:42,690
But that doesn't really
tell you what it is.

15
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:45,520
What do mean, you know,
the state of a contour?

16
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,480
Well, in fact, what they did is they,
they drew a contour, and they said,

17
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:51,020
because that's not a parameter,
that's a shape.

18
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:52,240
And they said,

19
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:58,260
let's represent the state of that
contour by an affine deformation, okay?

20
00:00:58,260 --> 00:00:59,500
Remember affine?

21
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:02,930
Affine is, it's a three point
to three point mapping,

22
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:04,420
takes how many parameters?

23
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:06,770
It's six parameters, okay?

24
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:11,132
Translation, rotation, scale, and sheer,
depending upon how you count those,

25
00:01:11,132 --> 00:01:14,370
I mean, it's six and
you can sort of divide them up any way.

26
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:20,050
So the idea is that each particle
represents a six dimensional vector.

27
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:23,870
So, by the way, that means our particles
are living in a six dimensional space,

28
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:26,800
and the bigger the,
the number of dimensions

29
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:29,200
the more particles you need to
sort of fill up that space,

30
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,670
in fact it doesn't grow so
nicely, does it, right?

31
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:34,660
I mean, if I go from two dimensions
to three dimensions right,

32
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:38,630
if I had a 100 particles before, if I
wanted to have the same density I would

33
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:40,465
now need a 1,000 particles, all right?

34
00:01:40,465 --> 00:01:44,100
I goes ec, it grows exponentially in
terms of the number of dimensions.

35
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:46,210
So for affine we're going to need six.

36
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:50,030
And as I said,
each of the particles represents that.

37
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:52,820
Here by the way is one of the videos.

38
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:57,150
And one of the questions you might ask
is, well where do you get the dynamics?

39
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:58,630
>> Where do you get the dynamics?

40
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:00,450
>> Well,
there are a couple of things you can do.

41
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:02,550
The easiest thing to do is to cheat.

42
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:03,200
All right?

43
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,060
So the reason we're using dynamics here
is that the girl is jumping up and

44
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:09,100
down in front of a cluttered background.

45
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:13,690
So to keep track of where her head is,
is kind of a difficult tracking problem,

46
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:15,620
that's why we're doing all
this work to begin with,

47
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:17,750
that's why we're using particles.

48
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:19,520
But when would tracking be easy?

49
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:25,200
How about if she was jumping around
in front of a green screen, or

50
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,170
a white background, okay?

51
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:32,314
Or in fact, even easier, suppose you
put her in a totally black turtle neck

52
00:02:32,314 --> 00:02:37,882
sweater, and you put her in front of
a black screen, kind of like that thing.

53
00:02:37,882 --> 00:02:40,691
By the way, Megan doesn't let me wear
black shirts because I'll disappear.

54
00:02:40,691 --> 00:02:45,492
But the point of my disappearing is all
you would see would be my floating head,

55
00:02:45,492 --> 00:02:49,445
which would be kind of creepy,
but it would very easy tracking.

56
00:02:49,445 --> 00:02:53,405
So you could have somebody jump
around with their floating head,

57
00:02:53,405 --> 00:02:57,210
track it very easily, and
measure the dynamics.

58
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:59,960
So one way of getting dynamics
is to sort of cheat and

59
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,780
get it from an easier system.

60
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:04,210
And I think for a bunch of
the stuff they do in cassation,

61
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:04,810
that's what they did.

62
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:06,480
They had an easier problem.
