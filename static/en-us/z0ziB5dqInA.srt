00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,725
Rather than ending on a morbid note, let's go back for a recap of the lesson.

2
00:00:03,725 --> 00:00:08,720
Development closing points. If mothers are exposed to toxic chemicals while

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,606
pregnant, the cognitive and neural development of the fetus may be permanently

4
00:00:12,606 --> 00:00:17,110
affected. Babies spend more time in REM sleep than adults do because there is

5
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:22,584
more neural growth going on. Children are born with a biologically based

6
00:00:22,584 --> 00:00:26,995
temperament that interacts with parenting style to create attachment styles.

7
00:00:26,995 --> 00:00:30,715
Attachment and emotional contact is just as important as food for healthy

8
00:00:30,715 --> 00:00:35,469
development in infants and young children. The adolescent brain is still

9
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:39,722
growing and this affects teens' ability to control their impulses. The

10
00:00:39,722 --> 00:00:43,203
intelligence we gain from experience does not decline as we enter late

11
00:00:43,203 --> 00:00:47,097
adulthood but our processing speed, mental quickness and abstract reasoning

12
00:00:47,097 --> 00:00:52,331
capabilities do. Humans develop in a similar way although the age at which we

13
00:00:52,331 --> 00:00:56,719
reach developmental milestones differs from person to person.
