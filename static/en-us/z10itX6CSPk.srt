00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,580
I want to talk just a quick second about computational complexity.

2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:05,040
Mentioned it before.

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,511
As we said, if your image is N by N and your kernel is M by M or

4
00:00:09,511 --> 00:00:12,415
we will call it W by W for sort of width.

5
00:00:12,415 --> 00:00:15,666
And it's easier to say W being different than N because [INAUDIBLE].

6
00:00:15,666 --> 00:00:17,090
Exactly, okay?

7
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:19,540
So the question is how many multiplies do we need?

8
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:24,390
And we said before that we need N times N times W times W,

9
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:26,240
or N squared W squared.

10
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,220
Doesn't N squared W squared sound better than N squared M squared?

11
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:31,470
Because when I say N squared M squared you have no idea what I'm saying if I

12
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:32,619
say it quickly.

13
00:00:32,619 --> 00:00:34,580
N squared W squared works.

14
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:36,730
And that can get sort of big.

15
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:38,640
So there's a cute little property.

16
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,670
Sometimes your main kernel, your, your filter,.

17
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:47,740
Can be created by convolving a single row with a single column.

18
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:48,730
And when that's true,

19
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:52,690
you can take advantage of the associative property, in terms of how we do this.

20
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:56,400
And this is what's refered to as a linearly separable kernel.

21
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,970
So let me show you an example.

22
00:00:57,970 --> 00:01:03,060
So here we have a single column, and here we have a single row.

23
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:05,600
And just think of 0s being around it.

24
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,910
If I convolve this column by this row I would get out

25
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:13,540
this new H which has 1 2 1 2 4 2 1 2 1 in it.

26
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:18,430
Okay? So c convolved with r equals H.

27
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:21,370
See, this is why we don't use my handwriting.

28
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:25,170
Let's suppose we wanted to filter something with H.

29
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:25,980
All right?

30
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:27,710
So that would look like this.

31
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:32,402
We have a function G that we're going to create by convolving F with H.

32
00:01:32,402 --> 00:01:38,420
But we said that C convolved R is the same as H, so that convolves F.

33
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:41,120
And because of the associative property,

34
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:44,970
C convolved with R then convolved with F.

35
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:46,660
In order to get our new function,

36
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:51,740
is the same as C convolved with R convolve with F.

37
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:54,450
And the reason that's better is that I can do

38
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:58,440
two column convolutions instead of one square.

39
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:05,800
So now instead of being W squared N squared it's 2 times W times N squared.

40
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,720
And that can be,

41
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:11,160
that used to be very important when computers were not quite as fast.

42
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:14,010
But it's still reasonably important, because for

43
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:19,170
example, if W is say a 31 by 31, that's a factor of 15 difference, all right?

44
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:21,120
So that's more than an order of magnitude.

45
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,910
Anytime you can do anything that buys you an order of magnitude for

46
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:24,940
not a lot of money.

47
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:26,350
You should go ahead and make that purchase.

48
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:28,850
Because orders of magnitude are hard to come by.

49
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:30,600
So here's a nice way of doing this.

50
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,965
So when we do various kinds of smoothing,

51
00:02:31,965 --> 00:02:35,660
etc, often we use linerally separable filters and you can just apply them.
