00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:03,580
So would the idea of diagnosis help us design an agent that can answer Raven's

2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:06,710
progressive matrices? Perhaps the best way to think about this is to

3
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:10,150
consider how your agent might respond when it answers a question wrong.

4
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:13,620
First, what data will it use to investigate its incorrect answer?

5
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:17,020
Second, what hypotheses might it have for incorrect answers?

6
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:21,740
Third, how will it select a hypothesis that best explains that data? And last,

7
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:24,560
once it's selected hypothesis that explains that data, how will it

8
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,400
use that to repair its reasoning, so it doesn't make the same mistake again?
