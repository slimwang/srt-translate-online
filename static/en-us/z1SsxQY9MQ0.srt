00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:04,456
If you've ever been in that situation, psychologists would suggest that you not

2
00:00:04,456 --> 00:00:09,593
helping the person was due to what we term diffusion of responsibility. And

3
00:00:09,593 --> 00:00:14,350
this just states that when many people are present, we are less likely to help.

4
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:17,914
Now, I mentioned earlier that, in addition to this research, many researchers

5
00:00:17,914 --> 00:00:22,714
have looked at bystander effect. And they have found that there are some

6
00:00:22,714 --> 00:00:26,146
variables that actually influence whether we are more likely or less likely to

7
00:00:26,146 --> 00:00:31,005
help, besides just the number of people present. Some of the variables and

8
00:00:31,005 --> 00:00:34,415
situations they looked at in regards to bystander effect and diffusion of

9
00:00:34,415 --> 00:00:39,695
responsibility. Have been emergencies versus non-emergencies. They've looked at

10
00:00:39,695 --> 00:00:46,042
the ambiguity and consequences of the situation. They've looked at priming by

11
00:00:46,042 --> 00:00:51,340
the bystander. So for example, the bystander may attempt to get eye contact

12
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:57,030
with a participant. They've also looked at cohesiveness and group membership.

13
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:01,464
And finally they looked at personality and background. There are lots of

14
00:01:01,464 --> 00:01:04,575
studies on the bystander effect, but now let's go back to Lauren and talk a

15
00:01:04,575 --> 00:01:09,431
little bit more about how we assess whether or not we should get involved.
