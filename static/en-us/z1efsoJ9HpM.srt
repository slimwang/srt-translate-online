00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,589
Now let's backtrack to an equation we've seen before. Y equals x squared plus 2x

2
00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:08,920
plus 10. I'd like you to do the same thing that we did in the last question, or

3
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:13,422
at least look for the same thing. I want you to find the roots of this equation.

00:00:13,422 --> 00:00:17,474
Once again, if you get more than one answer, separate them by commas.
