1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,390
As you've just seen in our solution, the car class was coupled with the system

2
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:08,893
and print stream classes simply because the car class does an output. And we'd

3
00:00:08,893 --> 00:00:13,768
like to reorganize the code so that that's no longer the case. Let's get going.

4
00:00:13,768 --> 00:00:18,184
In the tryToAdd method, we have a print statement, let's instead move that to

5
00:00:18,184 --> 00:00:24,482
the point where tryToAdd is called. That would be in the loadPassengers method

6
00:00:24,482 --> 00:00:28,570
of the simulation class. Go ahead and move the print statement.
