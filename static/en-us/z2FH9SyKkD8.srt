00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:03,475
Now let's turn to feedback. How would you let a user know

2
00:00:03,475 --> 00:00:07,830
when something was done? How does the user know that the action has

3
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:10,860
been completed? So now, now you're going to do the exchange. So

4
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:14,110
now you're exchanging with someone. How do you know when it's been completed?

5
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:15,440
>> Okay.

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,050
>> You know what's funny about these questions, is they seem obvious. Like,

7
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:21,770
duh, right, but actually when you're the designer, you have to think about this.

8
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:22,570
>> Yeah.

9
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:26,020
>> What happens that shows it's done?

10
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:26,090
>> Mhm.

11
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:29,270
>> The numbers change. Does anything else happen?

12
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:33,060
Do they see the numbers change? If you view

13
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:35,320
this like some Apple products sometimes, like when

14
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:37,380
you delete something, the little piece moves into the

15
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:40,770
trash can. You know, that's feedback. Right? But

16
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:44,490
it's also feedback that showed what happened. Like this

17
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:46,320
thing didn't just disappear, it moved into this

18
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,840
other folder that you can actually go to. [SOUND]
