1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:02,850
Well, the answer isn't because this would be too easy there

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:04,980
really is a good reason for why you don't want to

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:08,850
set viewport width to a fixed size. Namely that then your

4
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:12,680
site would scale the same layout across all devices, you'd get

5
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:15,130
the same layout of text and images on a four inch

6
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:18,700
cell phone as you do on a ten inch tablet. And

7
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:21,650
of course this means the fonts would be are consistent size

8
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:25,384
with that layout. You'd get the same size fonts rescaled on

9
00:00:25,384 --> 00:00:29,150
to a four inch phone as you would on a ten inch tablet.

10
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:31,160
And fundamentally this would result in

11
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:33,960
a poor user experience across mobile devices.
