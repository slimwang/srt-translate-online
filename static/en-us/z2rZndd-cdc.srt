For this question, you need to add a layer to this

2
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:06,320
plot to make the months be discrete. To do this, we

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:09,570
can add our scale_x_discrete layer. We're going to pass it the parameter

4
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:13,700
breaks, and set the breaks from zero to 203. Now I'm

5
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:17,160
going to step every 12 months. Since 12 months is a

6
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,380
year. And you might be wondering how I decided upon 203.

7
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:23,160
If I type in range mitchell month I can see. The

8
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,950
range of the month variable and it runs from zero to 203.

9
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:29,990
So this is my lower limit. And my upper limit. We can run this code

10
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:33,520
and we'd get a little bit of a better plot with our months in discrete units.
