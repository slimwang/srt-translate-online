1
00:00:01,159 --> 00:00:04,740
Before moving onto the main program,
you should take some time to set up your

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:08,970
development environment and fill in
any gaps you might have with Python.

3
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:12,550
We'll be making heavy use of NumPy,
Matplotlib, and Pandas.

4
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:14,940
Libraries that are staples
of the Python data toolkit.

5
00:00:14,939 --> 00:00:17,000
If you haven't worked with these before,

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,350
I suggest taking our Intro
to Data Analysis course.

7
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:22,009
Anaconda is a popular package and

8
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:24,800
environment manager built
specifically for data science.

9
00:00:25,879 --> 00:00:29,230
It's the easiest way to install and
manage all the libraries you'll need for

10
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:30,600
this program.

11
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:34,840
And finally, a lot of the work here
will be done using Jupyter notebooks.

12
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:38,450
Notebooks are documents that live in
your browser, and combine text, code and

13
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:40,560
images all in one place.

14
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,719
These are by far my favorite tools
when working on data projects.

15
00:00:43,719 --> 00:00:46,009
And you should take time to learn
how to use them effectively.
