1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
[Norvig] So here I have the 2 calls to max.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
And when I hit Run, I see the answers are 5 and -5.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
So the first call to max, what's the maximum of 3, 4, 5, and 0?

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
That's 5. That's the highest number.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
The second call to max I'm using the keyword argument which says

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
give me the maximum according to this function,

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
so give me the maximum of these numbers

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
according to the absolute value of those numbers.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
And the largest absolute value is -5 has the absolute value of 5, so that's the highest,

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
and so that gives me the highest value.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
And so here we see the result -5 is the actual value

12
00:00:42,000 --> 99:59:59,999
which has the highest according to the absolute function, and so it tells me -5 is the best.
