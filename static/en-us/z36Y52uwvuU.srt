00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,570
In this lesson we added 
new activities to our apps

2
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:05,370
and explored ways to structure 
and navigate between them.

3
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:07,860
And that meant learning 
all about intents

4
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:12,330
and how they're used in Android. 
Next up in Lesson 4, we're gonna

5
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:15,000
learn about the activity life cycle 
and make our apps

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,990
that much more useful by saving data. 
We'll began to databases

7
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:22,670
and learn about content providers, 
but first let's take another journey

8
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:24,320
into the history of Android.
