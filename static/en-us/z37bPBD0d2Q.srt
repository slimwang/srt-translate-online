1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:01,890
The perfect form is no form.

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:02,520
Right?

3
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:05,380
Nobody wants to fill in forms.

4
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:07,770
And I mentioned before,
I wrote a book about web forms.

5
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:10,920
The first two words in
the book are forms suck.

6
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:11,940
Which is very true, right?

7
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:14,860
Nobody wants to go through that
process of filling in a form.

8
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:16,560
They want what's on the other side.

9
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,180
They want that ride from Uber.

10
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:19,860
They want the book from Amazon.

11
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:23,900
They don't want to sit there retyping
their name for the bizillonth time.

12
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:27,670
And ultimately it's almost
an insult to the person.

13
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:29,740
Technology is supposed
to change the world, but

14
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:31,890
the damn computer doesn't even
remember what my name is?

15
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:35,870
How many times must I type my name
into the same freaking computer

16
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:38,180
before it knows who I am?

17
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:41,700
Like I said, it's almost insulting
to people to treat them that way.

18
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:45,260
So my ultimate example of
the best form is no form.

19
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:49,120
And that's why I like these things
that get you down to a single tap or

20
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,970
something where you can
just instinctively say,

21
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:54,600
I want that and get what you want.

22
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,000
We are a long ways away from that,
in any case, but

23
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,740
there are a couple examples,
which was very promising.

24
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:01,975
And, usually, that's how things start.

25
00:01:01,975 --> 00:01:06,310
Or you'll see one or two examples that
people say, oh, that's unachievable, but

26
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:09,515
gradually more and more people get to
that point and it becomes the new norm.
