1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:03,590
Now let's work on finding
the intersection of planes.

2
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:10,245
Let's start by assuming we have
two planes Ax + By + Cz = k1 and

3
00:00:10,245 --> 00:00:15,296
Dx + Ey + Fz = k2,
where the normal vectors A,

4
00:00:15,296 --> 00:00:19,146
B, C and D, E, F aren't parallel.

5
00:00:19,146 --> 00:00:22,230
Given two non-parallel planes,

6
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:26,590
I claim their intersection will be
a line instead of a single point.

7
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:29,890
From the picture,
this may seem intuitive but

8
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:33,340
how can we show this fact
algebraically in all cases?

9
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:37,100
Let's use a tool from the previous
lesson, the cross product.

10
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:42,940
Consider the cross product of these
two normal vectors n1 and n2.

11
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:45,800
Since the two normal
vectors are not parallel

12
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,060
their cross product will not be zero.

13
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:54,090
Also remember that n1 cross n2 will
be orthogonal to both n1 and n2.

14
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:57,890
Let's pick an arbitrary point in
the intersection of the two planes and

15
00:00:57,890 --> 00:00:59,740
call it x0.

16
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:03,480
If x is any other point
in the intersection,

17
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:08,420
then let's call d sub x,
the vector from x0 to x.

18
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:13,360
Since x0 and x are both in the first
plane, the vector connecting them,

19
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:18,910
d sub x, will be orthogonal to the
normal vector to the first plane, n1.

20
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:23,920
By similar reasoning since x0 and
x are both in plane two,

21
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,660
the vector connecting them
dx will be orthogonal to n2.

22
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:34,330
Since dx is orthogonal to both n1 and
n2 and since we're in three dimensions,

23
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:38,360
dx must be parallel to
the cross product of n1 and n2.

24
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:42,800
Since dx is parallel to n1 cross n2

25
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:47,680
no matter what x we picked, that means
the intersection of these two planes

26
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,350
has to be a line that is
parallel to n1 cross n2.

27
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:54,700
So what are the consequences of this?

28
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:59,650
Well if we have a system of two linear
equations in three dimensions, then

29
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:04,920
the set of point satisfying the system,
could form a line's worth of solutions,

30
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:08,639
if the equations define two
planes that are not parallel.

31
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:13,480
No solutions, if the equations
define different parallel planes, or

32
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:18,330
a whole plane's worth of solutions, if
the two equations define the same plane.

33
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:21,900
However, if we introduce
a third equation to our system,

34
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:24,010
then we could have another possibility.

35
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:28,830
The common intersection of the three
planes could be a single point.

36
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:32,140
Or it could be a line,
a plane, or nothing at all.

37
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:35,030
There are a few important
observations we should make here.

38
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:39,490
Recall that one equation in two
variables defines a line or

39
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:42,160
a one dimensional linear object.

40
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:46,500
A single equation in three
dimensional space defines a plane,

41
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,260
which is a two
dimensional linear object.

42
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:54,120
In general a single equation
in some number of variables,

43
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:58,180
will define a linear object
that has a number of dimensions

44
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:00,850
one less than the number of variables.

45
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:04,320
However we need to be careful to
distinguish between an equation

46
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,570
say in two variables,
and an equation in,

47
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:12,000
say, three variables, where one of
the variables has a coefficient of 0.

48
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,360
In the former case,
the equation defines a line in 2D.

49
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:20,320
But in the latter case the equation
defines a plane in 3D.

50
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:24,580
Being aware of the context of your
problem will help you avoid this error.

51
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:28,650
Another observation is that
the coefficients of the variables

52
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:31,600
in a linear equation
give the coordinates for

53
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,980
a normal vector to the linear
object it defines.

54
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:40,942
So for the line Ax + By = k we
obtain the normal vector AB and

55
00:03:40,942 --> 00:03:47,840
for the plane Ax + By + Cz = k,
we have a normal vector of ABC.

56
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,200
This trend will continue as we
move into higher dimensions.

57
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,970
And again, this is why the normal vector
is a useful piece of information for

58
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:56,730
defining a linear object.

59
00:03:56,730 --> 00:04:01,790
One last observation is that we need
at least two lines in two variables

60
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:04,830
to obtain a unique
intersection of lines.

61
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:08,140
And we need at least three planes
in three dimensional space or

62
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:12,060
three variables to obtain a unique
intersection of the planes.

63
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:16,180
This observation will generalize as we
progress into higher dimensions, and

64
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:19,690
in a little bit we'll see
an algebraic reason why it holds.
