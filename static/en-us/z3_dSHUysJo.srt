1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Now, let's turn the SIR model into equations.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
We're doing that one part after the other--first, the recovery.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
If I(t) is the number of infectious persons--it's I(t), and R(t) is the number

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
of recovered persons--it's R(t), so which of these equations makes the most sense.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:24,000
The derivative of the number of recovered persons with respect to time equals 5 days

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
times the number of infected persons 1/5 days times the number of infected persons 1/5 days

7
00:00:31,000 --> 99:59:59,999
times the number of recovered persons or minus 1/5 days times the number of infected persons.
