effectiveness, overall effectiveness be reduced.

00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:16,610

5
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:20,300
as that used for individual preparation. During the review meeting,

6
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:25,430
the individually noticed defects should be collected. In most cases they should

7
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:29,270
not be further discussed at the meeting. The detailed meeting process will be
