1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
So the answer is we need to find the second element of countries,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
so that's this element.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Remember that lists are indexed starting from 0,

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
so to find the entry corresponding to India,

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
we need to find the entry at position 1.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
The result of countries[1] will be the element of countries at that position,

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
which is the list containing 3 elements,

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
the string India, the string Delhi,

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:34,000
and the value 1210, which is the population of 1.2 billion people.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
To select the capital, that's the second element of that list,

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
so we use index 1 again to get that element,

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
and the value of countries[1][1] will be Delhi.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
And then we can just use print to print that out.

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Let's try that in the interpreter.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
So, running countries[1] will give us the element of countries

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
that corresponds to India.

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
And then to get the capital, we select element 1 from that.
