We've been working with parabolas quite a bit. So let's play with some cubic

2
00:00:03,953 --> 00:00:08,599
functions for a minute. There are two right here. We have the graphs of f of x

3
00:00:08,599 --> 00:00:15,400
equals x cubed, this green curve, and g of x equals 3x cubed, this red curve.

4
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:18,580
Now what I'd like you to do is write the equation of a function whose graph

5
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:23,790
will lie between these two graphs. And we'll still intersect the origin. We're

6
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:27,600
going to call this graph h of x. Let me show you an example of what h of x

7
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:31,440
might look like since there are a number of different equations that it could

8
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:37,270
be. So h of x might look something like this purple line. Think about how we

9
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:41,739
need to stretch or shrink f of x to make it lookmore like h of x.
