00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:02,600
One of the questions that a cognitive psychologist

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:06,700
would ask is, can we really multitask? Because that

3
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:09,540
has to do with focus and attention and that's

4
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:12,580
a cognitive or mental activity. Another question that a

5
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:16,230
cognitive psychologist might ask among these is about

6
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:19,370
the dog learning to salivate when the door opens

7
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:21,930
because what's going on here is the dog is

8
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:25,550
learning to associate the door opening with the food.

9
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:27,710
And that's a learning process, and that's also

10
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:30,830
the domain for cognitive psychologists. What's not the

11
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:35,440
domain for cognitive psychologists is how attachment changes

12
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,470
over our lives. That's more the question for

13
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:41,100
a developmental psychologist because it has to do

14
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,660
with change over time. Another question that would

15
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:47,410
not be one for cognitive psychology would be

16
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:51,360
mood and dopamine. That's the brain and how neurotransmitters

17
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:56,280
affect our behavior. That would be the question for behavioral neuroscience. The

18
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:00,410
shooter, and whether he's having a psychotic episode, and how competent he

19
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:05,530
is to stand trial is more for a forensic psychologist. Because that

20
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:10,260
has to do with his mental state and the legal question of competence.
