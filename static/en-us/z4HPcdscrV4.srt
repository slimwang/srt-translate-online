1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,160
Try writing some code to project a point from 3D to 2D.

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:07,430
Make sure you use the matrix operation just described.

3
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:12,070
Let's say you're given the coordinates of a point p and a focal length f.

4
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:16,190
Write a function that returns the location of the projected point on the 2D

5
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:17,590
image plane.

6
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:19,860
Here's what your function should look like.

7
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:23,980
You can test your code by passing in a value for p and f.

8
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:26,450
Let's say the units are in millimeters.

9
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:28,830
You can display the result using disp.

10
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:31,950
Try out different coordinates and focal lengths.

11
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:35,400
Note that we will test your function against the known set of inputs when you

12
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:35,960
hit submit.
