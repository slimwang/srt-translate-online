00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:02,830
>> There''s one last thing I want
to demonstrate with operators, and

2
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:07,350
that's how the increment and
decrement operators effect assignment.

3
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:09,830
We'll start by creating a few variables.

4
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:12,870
And we'll also create a variable
that adds all of these together.

5
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:15,550
So, right now our total
pounds is equal to 4.

6
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:18,920
Now, if I use the increment or decrement
operator in front of a variable,

7
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:22,080
then it's applied before any other
operators in this expression.

8
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,870
And that includes
the assignment operator.

9
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:29,120
So, if we do plus, plus pounds of flour,
then our total pounds is

10
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:32,790
now 5 because the increment
is applied before assignment.

11
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:35,744
And we can check to see the new
value of pounds of flour,

12
00:00:35,744 --> 00:00:37,810
which is 2 after being incremented.

13
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:42,520
Now, if instead I move the increment or
decrement operator after the variable it

14
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:46,950
modifies, then it's applied after
the other operators in this expression.

15
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:48,380
And that, again, includes assignment.

16
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:53,840
So, in this case, we've put the
increment operator after poundsOfflour

17
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,025
and our totalPounds is still
the original 4 pounds.

18
00:00:57,025 --> 00:01:00,305
But we can see that pounds of
flour has been incremented to 2.

19
00:01:00,305 --> 00:01:04,105
It just happened after
the assignment of total pounds.

20
00:01:04,105 --> 00:01:06,755
So, you'll want to be extra careful
when you use these increment and

21
00:01:06,755 --> 00:01:09,635
decrement operators
because of this nuance.

22
00:01:09,635 --> 00:01:11,465
So, I'd encourage you
to take some time and

23
00:01:11,465 --> 00:01:14,905
play around with them on a playground
until you feel really comfortable.
