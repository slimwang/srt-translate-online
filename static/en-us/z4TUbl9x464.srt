1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,820
So let's see what happens if Alice is running her algorithm on a larger network.

2
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:09,750
So, instead of 5 communication centers, she has 20 communication centers

3
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:11,100
in her network.

4
00:00:11,100 --> 99:59:59,999
How often are the lines 3 to 5 executed in that case?
