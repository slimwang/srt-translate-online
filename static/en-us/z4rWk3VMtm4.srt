Branch piction and if conversion help us eliminate most of

2
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:10,410
the pipeline problems caused by control hazards. But data dependencies can

3
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:15,210
also prevent us from finishing one instruction every single cycle. So,

4
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:20,260
what can we do about data dependencies? And why stop at only one instruction per

5
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:25,280
cycle? In this lesson we will learn about instruction level parallelism which

6
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:30,010
tells us how many instructions could be possibly executed in any given cycle.
