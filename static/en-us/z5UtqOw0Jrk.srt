00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,266
Let me try to give you some intuition as to what goes wrong when we write grammars.

2
00:00:04,267 --> 00:00:12,832
Now, suppose this is the universe of all possible strings, sequences of words,

3
00:00:12,833 --> 00:00:20,899
and suppose this--I'm drawing a Venn diagram here--is the language that we're trying to specify.

4
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:25,466
The ideal is that we can write a grammar which is very close to that language.

5
00:00:25,467 --> 00:00:34,999
Say we write a grammar that specifies a language which we'll call Lg, the language specified by that grammar,

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,932
which is very close to the actual grammar. It only misses in a few places.

7
00:00:38,933 --> 00:00:45,699
Now, if actual grammars were neat things like this rectangle here, then it would be easy to write grammars like that,

8
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:50,399
and we'd be in good shape. But it turns out that natural languages are not like that;

9
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:58,699
natural languages are messy, biological things that have evolved over time for use by humans in a variety of contexts,

10
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:07,032
and they are messy. They aren't just rectangles like this. They're funny-shaped things that go out in different directions.

11
00:01:07,033 --> 00:01:10,432
To write a grammar for that is much more complicated.

12
00:01:10,433 --> 00:01:16,966
We could write a grammar that covers everything, but then there'd be other stuff out here that it covers that it shouldn't cover.

13
00:01:16,967 --> 00:01:24,032
We could write a grammar where everything in the grammar is grammatical, but then there'd be lots of other grammatical things

14
00:01:24,033 --> 00:01:28,066
that are in the language that are not covered by the grammar.

15
00:01:28,067 --> 00:01:36,732
Or we could try to deal with cases one at a time. We could start with this grammar, and then say,

16
00:01:36,733 --> 00:01:41,299
"Well, let's say I add a little bump here to deal with these exceptions,"

17
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:49,466
and another one to deal with these exceptions, and hope that those rules to deal with exceptions are approximately right.

18
00:01:49,467 --> 00:01:53,399
They got a little bit wrong. And hope they don't introduce an error someplace else.

19
00:01:53,400 --> 00:02:02,732
Maybe if we introduce this rule here to try to capture this bunch, we inadvertently also capture another bunch over here.

20
00:02:02,733 --> 00:02:09,832
And it turns out that over decades of trying to write grammars that fit natural languages just right has proven to be

21
00:02:09,833 --> 00:02:18,799
an extremely difficult task. And so now we'll see some tools that go beyond the simple context-free grammars that we saw,

22
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:27,499
the grammars of the form "S goes to nP vP" that can get us closer to this ideal of having coverage

23
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:30,933
that covers the messy natural language.
