00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:04,840
To animate our map over the years of the World Cup, we need two things.

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:09,200
The first of which, is a function to update our map, since we'll be

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:13,250
repeatedly calling the updates we need to for every year, we want to

4
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:18,620
encapsulate it into a function, that we can easily call whenever we need to.

5
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:23,110
And the second thing we need, is a way to cycle through all the years

6
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:27,300
that the World Cup was held, and pass those years to our update function.

7
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:30,060
For now, let us just focus on writing this first function.
