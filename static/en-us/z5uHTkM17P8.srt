1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,100
Let's consider an example for max-min fair

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:06,610
allocation. Let's suppose that we have a link

3
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:14,270
with capacity ten and four demands. 2, 2.6, 4, and 5. Now, obviously the demands

4
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:19,150
exceed capacity. So we need to figure out a way of allocating rates to each of

5
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:25,440
these demands that is max-min fair. First, note that 10 divided by 4 is 2.5.

6
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:28,330
But this is not a good solution, because

7
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:31,060
the first user only needs 2. So the first

8
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:33,300
user would have an excess of .5 under

9
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,730
this allocation. So what we want to do is take

10
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:38,970
this excess of .5 and divide it among

11
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:41,880
the remaining 3 users, whose demands have not yet

12
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:44,898
been fulfilled. This would yield an allocation of

13
00:00:44,898 --> 00:00:50,580
2, 2.67, 2.67 and 2.67. But now user 2

14
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:56,060
has an excess of 0.07, so we take that excess, divide it among

15
00:00:56,060 --> 00:01:00,220
the remaining 2, and that gives us our final maximum fair allocation. Note that

16
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:02,140
this is called maximum fairness, because it

17
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:05,500
maximizes the minimum share to each user

18
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:10,140
whose demand is not fully serviced. In this case, the 3rd and 4th users.
