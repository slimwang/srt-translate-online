1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:04,210
Let's suppose you liked what I told
you about simple moving average, and

2
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:07,320
you're looking at the historical
price of this stock.

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:11,160
And you're trying to decide,
okay, how much of an excursion

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:15,630
from the simple moving average should
I use as a signal for a buy or sell?

5
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:18,620
So let's add our simple
moving average line here.

6
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:23,800
Now you might say, okay, I think I
see an excursion of say 1% like this,

7
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:28,490
that that's a meaningful excursion and
I should trade based on that.

8
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:33,130
So let's carry forward and now you're
getting this huge excursions all

9
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:36,280
the time and you'd be chasing
it trying to trade all the time.

10
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:41,300
So clearly a fixed number is
probably not the best way to go.

11
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:42,370
If you look at this chart,

12
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:45,500
you'll see that we've got a region
of low volatility over here.

13
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,940
And high volatility over here.

14
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:51,520
So John Bollinger observed that for

15
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:56,538
low volatility stocks or stocks that are
currently experiencing low volatility,

16
00:00:56,538 --> 00:01:01,060
you probably want to use
a smaller number for that trigger.

17
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:05,140
And when we see high volatility, you
probably want to use a larger number.

18
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:09,108
Well, how can we accomplish that, well,
we can use the standard deviation.

19
00:01:09,108 --> 00:01:14,127
So what Bollinger suggested was, okay,
let's take this simple moving average,

20
00:01:14,127 --> 00:01:18,790
but let's add a band above and
below two standard deviations.

21
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:20,460
And that's our measure for

22
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:25,340
how strong of a deviation we want to
see before we respond to it.

23
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:27,210
So for instance in this region,

24
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:32,290
this smaller excursion goes outside that
band, so we should take a look at it.

25
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:36,520
But over here, it takes a much larger
excursion to get our attention.

26
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:39,910
How might we use Bollinger Bands now for
trading signals?

27
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:43,090
Here's a method that I've
seen that is effective.

28
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:47,520
So here's a rule of thumb for using
Bollinger Bands that might be effective.

29
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,810
You look for
times where the price's outside,

30
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:55,760
one of these Bollinger Bands and
when it crosses to the inside.

31
00:01:55,760 --> 00:02:00,790
So for instance, here, we're outside and
we cross to the inside.

32
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:03,090
So this would be a cell signal.

33
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:06,840
We've got a large excursion
from the simple moving average.

34
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,979
And we're expecting that it will
retreat back to the average.

35
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:13,870
And it's demonstrated that it's
retreating because it's gone from

36
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:18,220
outside the band back
towards the moving average.

37
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:23,890
Conversely, here we're moving
from below the lower band.

38
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:26,700
Back towards the simple moving average.

39
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,750
And that would be a buy signal.

40
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:29,500
So, recapping.

41
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:33,430
The way that people use
Bollinger Bands is they look for

42
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:37,210
the price to go outside the bands.

43
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:41,210
And then look for
it to retreat back through the band.

44
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:43,850
And that's verification that
it is moving back toward

45
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:44,970
the simple moving average.

46
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:50,112
Here's how to calculate the Bollinger
Band on a particular day t.

47
00:02:50,112 --> 00:02:54,500
So here's the price on that particular
day t, we subtract the value of

48
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:58,550
the simple moving average, so
we are comparing these two values, and

49
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:01,930
then divide by 2 times
the standard deviation.

50
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:06,992
So the value up here is going to
be something greater than 1.0

51
00:03:06,992 --> 00:03:12,440
because if it's exactly at this band,
it's exactly 2 standard deviations away,

52
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:15,210
so it would be a value
of 1 right at the band.

53
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:17,360
It's greater than 1 here.

54
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:23,110
Similarly, down here, we would
have a value less than negative 1.

55
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:28,260
Because the price excursion is more
than 2 standard deviations below.

56
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:31,130
So we typically expect to see values for

57
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:36,985
this Bollinger Band calculation
to be between negative 1, and 1.

58
00:03:36,985 --> 00:03:37,805
In other words,

59
00:03:37,805 --> 00:03:41,845
most of the time the stock is
going to be between those bands.

60
00:03:41,845 --> 00:03:45,075
But occasionally, we'll see excursions
above and below those values.
