00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,540
Now that we've talked about our regions and whether or not our inequality is

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:07,177
satisfied in each of them. Let's make a table to figure out the value of each of

3
00:00:07,177 --> 00:00:10,873
the individual factors within each region and how that affects the value of the

4
00:00:10,873 --> 00:00:14,808
entire quantity that we're interested in, in our inequality. Remember, you don't

5
00:00:14,808 --> 00:00:18,448
need to actually use the inequality we're talking about in this table itself,

6
00:00:18,448 --> 00:00:22,907
but I'll write it here just for reference. So in each column think about the

7
00:00:22,907 --> 00:00:28,303
quantity at the top. Either x minus 4x plus 4, or the product of those two and

8
00:00:28,303 --> 00:00:33,958
then for each of these intervals or values, this on the left tell me if quantity

9
00:00:33,958 --> 00:00:39,677
is positive, negative, or 0. So for example If I'm thinking about x minus 4 and

10
00:00:39,677 --> 00:00:45,269
I let x equal something greater then 4, then x minus 4 is going to be positive.

11
00:00:45,269 --> 00:00:47,895
So fill in the table just like that.
