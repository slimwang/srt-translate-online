00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,778
Sometimes we might run into inequalities that are not in slope intercept form.

2
00:00:04,778 --> 00:00:09,487
We can handle these inequalities much like we did linear equations. We can try

3
00:00:09,487 --> 00:00:14,184
and solve this inequality for y. First I subtract x from both sides, to get

4
00:00:14,184 --> 00:00:19,324
negative 4y is less than or equal to negative 12 minus x. I'm going to rearrange

5
00:00:19,324 --> 00:00:24,029
the terms here. So, I'll have negative 4y less than or equal to negative x minus

6
00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:28,632
12. Notice that the sign in front of the term stays with it. The x is still

7
00:00:28,632 --> 00:00:33,333
negative, as before. And this 12 is still negative, as before. Finally, we

8
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:37,959
divide every term by negative 4. Here's where we need to be very careful. We're

9
00:00:37,959 --> 00:00:42,323
dividing by a negative, and this is an inequality symbol. Just like from before,

10
00:00:42,323 --> 00:00:46,695
we know we need to reverse the inequality sign. The other thing we want to watch

11
00:00:46,695 --> 00:00:50,797
out for are the negatives on the other side. A negative divided by a negative

12
00:00:50,797 --> 00:00:54,895
makes a positive, and the same is true here. So we're left with, y is greater

13
00:00:54,895 --> 00:00:58,376
than or equal to 1 4th x plus 3. And don't forget about that 1 as the

14
00:00:58,376 --> 00:01:02,308
coefficient in front of x. That's how we can get positive 1 4th. Now that we

15
00:01:02,308 --> 00:01:06,491
have this inequality, we can graph it just like before. We'll start by plotting

16
00:01:06,491 --> 00:01:10,370
the line. Then we'll determine whether or not that line should be dashed or

17
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:14,822
solid. And finally, we can determine the region by using a test point. We plug

18
00:01:14,822 --> 00:01:19,596
in a point to see if it makes the inequality true. If it does, we want that

19
00:01:19,596 --> 00:01:22,330
region. If not, we'll take the other one.
