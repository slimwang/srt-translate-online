1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:01,650
So what's the cost of insertion?

2
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:03,840
I want you to figure it out.

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,760
Suppose I give you a bag B as in bravo.

4
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:09,710
Let's assume that the bag
has n elements in it.

5
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:10,950
Here's a new element to insert.

6
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:13,740
The question is, what's the cost?

7
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:17,600
Is it constant time, log time,
linear time, or n log n time?
