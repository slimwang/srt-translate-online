1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Well, let's try to reason these out since they're extra complicated.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Suppose you give me your finite state machine A.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Here I've drawn all these dots to mean it could be bigger in the middle.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I don't get to know what it is. This is going to have to work for any finite state machine.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
But I do know that it has a start state and an end state--a final state.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to draw another copy of A on my paper.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Then I'm going to go back to the first one and where it was a final state,

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I'm going to make it not a final state, so I change this part.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Then I'm going to add an epsilon transition here, and I'm going to erase this other start state arrow.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Now I have a new finite state machine that accepts strings of the following form--

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
there has to be some part x here that would've been accepted by A.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Then there's some possibly different part y here that would be accepted by A again,

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
so in general I accept x epsilon y or just xy.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
In fact, I can always do this.

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:01,000
If you give me any finite state machine, I can always make a twice as big finite state machine

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
that accepts one string from you followed by one independent, separate string from you.

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
However, for this one it's going to be a little more complicated.

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
It turns out that the answer is only sometimes.

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Let me give you an example for yes and an example for no.

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Let's say the finite state machine you give me for big B just has one string in it--lowercase b.

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'll do the same trickery as before, and now I have a new finite state machine that accepts bb.

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Since there is only one string in the language, I've now doubled it. This works fine.

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I can do it at least once, but now here comes the evil part.

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
This upper example--this blue example--of B totally worked.

25
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Now I'm going give you an example for B that does not.

26
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Here, B is a*x.

27
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
This finite state machine accepts the regular expression a*x.

28
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Any number of a's, possibly zero, but then you need an x.

29
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Now, note the difference between this sentence and its earlier copy.

30
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
This requires exactly the same string double.

31
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Let's imagine that I do complete this finite state machine construction--

32
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
the same sort of thing I've done before.

33
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Now I'm going to write out some of the strings that would be in a*x twice.

34
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Well, I could have no a's, so then I have no a's followed by an x.

35
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Or I could have one a--that's looking okay so far.

36
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Or I could have two a's, or I could have three a's.

37
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
This pattern should be looking ominous.

38
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Or in general, if I were able to double this machine so that it accepted the same string both times

39
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:44,000
rather than a new string each time, I would be recognizing (a^n)x(a^n)x.

40
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:51,000
For the same reason that a^Nb^n can't be recognized--it's not regular--neither can this.

41
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Here we have one positive example and one negative example,

42
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
so it only holds sometimes.

43
00:02:57,000 --> 99:59:59,999
This was super tricky. Do not feel bad if you didn't see this the first time.
