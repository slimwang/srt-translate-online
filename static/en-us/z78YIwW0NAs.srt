1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,596
When we use the Pythagorean theorem to solve, we'll find that this distance,

2
00:00:03,596 --> 00:00:08,349
from the top of the ladder to the base of the building, is 15 feet. Great

3
00:00:08,349 --> 00:00:13,215
solving if you found it. But when you use the Pythagorean Theorem, we'll have x

4
00:00:13,215 --> 00:00:18,904
squared plus x minus 7 squared equals 17 squared. We'll square these legs and

5
00:00:18,904 --> 00:00:23,903
take the sum of the squares to get the square of the hypotenuse. Squaring these

6
00:00:23,903 --> 00:00:29,029
expressions, we get this equation. We'll add the like terms together here to

7
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:35,295
get 2x squared minus 14x plus 49 equals 289. Then, we'll subtract 289 from both

8
00:00:35,295 --> 00:00:40,869
sides to get our quadratic expression set equal to 0. Each of these terms is

9
00:00:40,869 --> 00:00:46,062
divisible by 2, so we can divide our equation by 2. We take our quadratic

10
00:00:46,062 --> 00:00:49,897
expression, and we factor it by finding the factors of negative 120 that sum to

11
00:00:49,897 --> 00:00:56,412
negative 7. Those factors are negative 15 and positive 8. We set each of these

12
00:00:56,412 --> 00:01:02,569
factors equal to 0, and then we solve for values of x. So x can equal positive

13
00:01:02,569 --> 00:01:07,536
15 or x can equal negative 8. We know that the distance cannot be negative 8

14
00:01:07,536 --> 00:01:12,380
feet, since distance is always positive. So instead, x is going to equal 15

15
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:16,670
feet. This is the distance from the top of the ladder to the base of the

16
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:17,900
building.
