1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
And the answer is this is Scale Invariance.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Scale means how large the image is, relative to the camera.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
This is governed by the Perspective Projection Law that we discussed before.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
The further objects are away, the smaller they appear.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
We wish any classifier to be invariant to scale

6
00:00:19,000 --> 99:59:59,999
so it can recognize objects nearby or really far away.
