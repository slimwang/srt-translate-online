00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:04,886
Different emotions are expressed differently on the face and in our voice. Each

2
00:00:04,886 --> 00:00:08,918
emotion has its own unique combination of facial muscles and voice changes

3
00:00:08,918 --> 00:00:14,771
often involving pitch. Let's take fear for example. This involves the eyebrows

4
00:00:14,771 --> 00:00:19,496
being lifted and pulled together and the upper eyelids are also lifted. And the

5
00:00:19,496 --> 00:00:23,495
lips are stretched and pulled apart. Anger, on the other hand, the eyebrows are

6
00:00:23,495 --> 00:00:27,260
lowered and pulled together. The eye lids are tightened and the lips are

7
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:32,561
thinned and pressed together. One interesting application of analyzing facial

8
00:00:32,561 --> 00:00:36,979
expressions of emotion. Is being able to distinguish which emotion is being

9
00:00:36,979 --> 00:00:41,614
expressed based strictly on muscle movements. We know, or we think we know what

10
00:00:41,614 --> 00:00:46,661
someone's feeling, just by their face. They tell us when they're sad, angry,

11
00:00:46,661 --> 00:00:51,960
disgusted or happy just with their face. And as it turns out, sometimes we can

12
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:57,402
be fooled. A happy face is not always a genuinely happy face. There are in fact

13
00:00:57,402 --> 00:01:01,371
differences in the muscle movements of a true smile, and a social smile, or a

14
00:01:01,371 --> 00:01:03,329
fake smile.
