00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:04,420
There are several types of caches
when it comes to which blocks can be

2
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:07,060
placed where in the cache.

3
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:12,020
The cache examples we have seen so
far are the fully associative caches.

4
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:13,840
In this type of a cache,

5
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:18,310
any block from memory can be
placed into any line in the cache.

6
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:25,400
So if the cache has room for 16 lines,
then we need to search up to 16 tags

7
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:29,400
in order to find whether the block we're
looking for is actually in the cache.

8
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:34,460
The opposite of that is
a direct-mapped cache where for

9
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:39,140
a given block that is exactly one place
in the cache where that block can go.

10
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:44,000
That means that we only need
to check one line in the cache

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,140
if it contains that block because that's
the only line that it can possibly be.

12
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:52,120
Different blocks, of course, will still
be able to map to different lines, but

13
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:55,500
a particular block can only go
into one place in the cache.

14
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:59,130
And then, of course, there is the middle
ground between them, which is called

15
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:04,400
a set-associative cache, where there
are N lines where a block can be.

16
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,860
Now, N typically will
be larger than one and

17
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:11,660
smaller than the total number
of lines in the cache, so

18
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:16,575
we can really view the direct-mapped
cache, as a case of a set-associative

19
00:01:16,575 --> 00:01:21,345
cache, where N is one and
a fully associative cache is an extreme

20
00:01:21,345 --> 00:01:26,935
case of a set-associative cache where
N is equal to the lines in the cache.

21
00:01:26,935 --> 00:01:29,745
But what we normally call
a set-associate cache

22
00:01:29,745 --> 00:01:34,690
has a relatively small N compared to
the number of blocks in that cache, yet

23
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:40,060
that N typically is two, four or
eight so it's larger than one.

24
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:42,970
Now let's look at each of
these types of caches.
