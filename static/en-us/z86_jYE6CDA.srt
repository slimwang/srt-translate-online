1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The answer is that it depends on the h function.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
A-star will find the lowest-cost path

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:16,000
if the h function for a state is less than the true cost

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
of the path to the goal through that state.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
In other words, we want the h to never overestimate the distance to the goal.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
We also say that h is optimistic.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Another way of stating that

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
is that h is admissible,

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
meaning is it admissible to use it to find the lowest-cost path.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Think of all of these of being the same way

11
00:00:45,000 --> 99:59:59,999
of stating the conditions under which A-star finds the lowest-cost path.
