00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:04,900
An alternative view of a use case to that provided by a sequence diagram,

2
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:10,780
would be a communication diagram. In the communication diagram, it looks like

3
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:14,940
a class model diagram. That is, there are rectangles corresponding to classes,

4
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:19,150
and there's lines between them. However, in this case the lines correspond to

5
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:22,800
instances of communication, likely operation calls.
