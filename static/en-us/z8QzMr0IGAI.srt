1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The answer is 200 mm for our focal length.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
We can transform this expression over here to bring f to the left side.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
And z over B equals 200, and delta x equals 1 mm.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 99:59:59,999
We get 200 mm as an answer for our question.
