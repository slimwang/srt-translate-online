You've seen a lot of different parts of
user experience for specific products.

2
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:08,130
Now I'd like you to find a relatively
new product and try it out and

3
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:11,060
document all of your thoughts
about the user experience.

4
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:13,830
This can be anything from the home page,
to emails, to checkout,

5
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:15,470
to interactions on the site.

6
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:17,550
You want to build an eye for
amazing products, and

7
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:20,990
the best way to do that is to see
how others have done it in the past.

8
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:25,100
So, write a post that describes
the tasks you attempt in the product,

9
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:29,980
how the product did and did not help
you, how you felt along the way, and

10
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:33,790
any design elements you feel
contributed to your experience.

11
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:34,900
Once you've written your post and

12
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:37,400
shared it on the discussions,
check this box to continue.
