1
00:00:00,715 --> 00:00:02,590
>> Okay, Michael, what's your answer?

2
00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:06,570
>> Alright. So. Again, a lot feels like a good

3
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:09,338
answer, it's already written down on the left. But it's

4
00:00:09,338 --> 00:00:11,740
also wait, wait, may be we can quantify this. So

5
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:13,990
if it were. Maybe one way to think about this

6
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:16,370
is if each of the, each of those empty boxes

7
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:19,510
there, is either true or false. It's kind of like a

8
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:22,960
bit. And we're asking how many different bit patterns can

9
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,800
we make? And in general, it's two to the number

10
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,100
of positions, but here the number of positions is 2 to the n. So it ought to

11
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:34,510
be 2, to the 2 to the n. Which is that the same as 4 to the n?

12
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:35,446
>> No.

13
00:00:35,446 --> 00:00:36,476
>> Okay.

14
00:00:36,476 --> 00:00:38,653
>> But you're right. It's 2 to the 2

15
00:00:38,653 --> 00:00:42,530
to the n. So it's a double exponential and

16
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:50,820
it's not the same thing as 4 to the nth. It's actually 2 to the 2 to the nth.

17
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:52,650
Now how big of a number do you think that is Michael?

18
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:57,250
>> I'm going to go again to my go to place and just say a lot.

19
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:58,810
>> It is, in fact, a lot and I'm

20
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:00,640
going, I actually, I'm going to look over here, and I'm

21
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,930
going to tell you. That for even a small value

22
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:07,740
of n, this gets to be a really big number.

23
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:11,740
>> So for, for one, it's 2 to the 2

24
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:14,230
to the 1, which is 4. That's not a big number.

25
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:15,690
>> That's true. What about two?

26
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:16,640
>> For

27
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,300
two, it's 2 to the 2 to the 2. So 2 to

28
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:23,070
the 2 is 4, so it's 2 to the 4, which is 16.

29
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:24,850
>> What about three?

30
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:28,480
>> Alright, so that's two to the 8th, which is 256?

31
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:32,350
>> Mm-hm. So that's growing pretty fast, don't you think?

32
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:34,410
>> Sure, but those aren't big numbers yet.

33
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:38,120
>> What if I told you, [LAUGH] that for n equals

34
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:42,148
6, 2 to the 2 to the n was, I'm going to start

35
00:01:42,148 --> 00:01:52,148
writing it, okay? 18466744073709551616.

36
00:02:02,302 --> 00:02:03,599
>> Holy monkeys.

37
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:06,863
>> Yes, that is in fact the technical term for this number,

38
00:02:06,863 --> 00:02:10,038
it's a holy monkey. It is a very, very big number.

39
00:02:10,038 --> 00:02:12,120
So 2 to the n grows very fast. We already called

40
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,150
that evil. 2 to the 2 to the n is a

41
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:17,660
double exponential and it's super evil. It grows very, very, very,

42
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:20,930
very, very fast. So what's the point of this exercise, Michael?

43
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:24,810
It's, it's to point that the space of decision trees, the

44
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:28,810
hypothesis space that we've chosen, is very expressive because there's lots

45
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:32,470
of different functions that you can represent. But that also means

46
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:34,450
we have to have some clever way to search

47
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:37,150
among them. And that gets us back to our

48
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:40,050
notion of an algorithm with actually going to very

49
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:44,300
smartly go through and pick out which decision tree. Because

50
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:45,820
if we aren't very smart about it and we

51
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:49,130
start eliminating whole decision trees along the way. Then we're

52
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:51,560
going to have to look it to billions upon, billions

53
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:55,090
upon, billions upon, billion upon, billion of possible decision choice.
