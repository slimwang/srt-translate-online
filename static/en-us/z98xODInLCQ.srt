00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:04,080
One important aspect of any research study is something called the Effect Size.

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,792
In experimental studies, or studies with a treatment variable, effect size

3
00:00:07,792 --> 00:00:12,520
refers to the size of a treatment effect. Makes intuitive sense. In non

4
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:16,417
experimental studies. The term effect size may refer to the strength of the

5
00:00:16,417 --> 00:00:21,002
relationship between our variables. In the Z-test or in the t-test, the

6
00:00:21,002 --> 00:00:24,542
simplest measure effect size is the mean difference which is simply the

7
00:00:24,542 --> 00:00:30,905
difference between the two means. In the Z-test or the one sample t-test, the

8
00:00:30,905 --> 00:00:35,813
mean difference is x bar minus mu. Mean differences are great when we have

9
00:00:35,813 --> 00:00:39,832
variables with easy to understand meanings. In other words, those that we can

10
00:00:39,832 --> 00:00:42,469
understand without any specialized training.
