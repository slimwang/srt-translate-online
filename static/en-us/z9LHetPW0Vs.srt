00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:05,360
To understand caches, we must first
understand the concept of locality,

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:07,780
which is also called
the locality principle.

3
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:10,750
It says that things
that will happen soon

4
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:14,170
are likely to be close to
things that just happened.

5
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:17,450
This means that if we know
something about past behavior,

6
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:21,440
we're likely to be able to guess
what's going to happen soon.

7
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:24,480
We have already used this
locality principle, for example,

8
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,801
when we did branch expression.

9
00:00:25,801 --> 00:00:28,060
Now we will use it for caches.
