00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,894
>From the FriendlyChat project
page in the Firebase console,

2
00:00:03,894 --> 00:00:05,923
select Add Firebase to your iOS app.

3
00:00:05,923 --> 00:00:08,487
[BLANK_AUDIO]

4
00:00:08,487 --> 00:00:12,489
This opens up a window that asks us for
and iOS bundle ID and App Store ID.

5
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:16,390
A bundle ID is a unique
ID that Apple and

6
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:19,440
iOS devices use to precisely
identify your app.

7
00:00:20,519 --> 00:00:24,019
And the app store ID is a numeric
ID that identifies one or

8
00:00:24,019 --> 00:00:28,519
more apps from a single developer or
development team on the app store.

9
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:31,580
These settings usually
come into play for

10
00:00:31,579 --> 00:00:35,500
apps you plan on publishing to the app
store, but since we won't be publishing

11
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:38,039
anything this weekend,
we'll use stand in values for now.

12
00:00:39,299 --> 00:00:44,950
Let's go with
com.google.firebase.udacity.friendlyChat

13
00:00:44,951 --> 00:00:50,204
for the bundle ID, and for
the app ID, 123456 is fine.

14
00:00:50,204 --> 00:00:51,958
And we'll click Add App.

15
00:00:51,959 --> 00:00:53,421
Once you click add app,

16
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:58,039
a Google Service dash info dot p list
file should download automatically.

17
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:02,679
This file contains all the information
that your app needs to find the project

18
00:01:02,679 --> 00:01:03,966
on the Firebase servers.

19
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:07,930
If I click continue it will take us
through the rest of this tutorial on

20
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:09,790
how to set up our Firebase project.

21
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:12,220
Now you're welcome to read
through it if you choose but

22
00:01:12,219 --> 00:01:15,230
we can just click x here because we're
going to cover the same steps now.

23
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:20,109
First open up the project if
you haven't done so already.

24
00:01:20,109 --> 00:01:23,253
If you need to download the project for
this course you can do so

25
00:01:23,253 --> 00:01:24,227
in the resources.

26
00:01:24,227 --> 00:01:26,581
[BLANK_AUDIO]

27
00:01:26,581 --> 00:01:29,993
With the project open I'm
going to expand these folders and

28
00:01:29,993 --> 00:01:32,310
find our supporting files.

29
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:36,097
I'll right click supporting files and
add files to the FriendlyChat swift.

30
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,579
And I want to find that Google p list
file that we just downloaded and

31
00:01:40,579 --> 00:01:42,349
it's in my downloads folder.

32
00:01:42,349 --> 00:01:46,169
So we'll select it and add and
add it to the project.

33
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:50,799
Once it's added to the project,
if you click it in the navigator,

34
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:54,840
you'll see a dictionary of properties,
and I've highlighted the bundle ID here.

35
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,859
These properties will be used later
on by the code that we write.

36
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:03,960
Okay, so to recap, we've created
our app on Firebase console, and

37
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:07,239
we've added the plist
file to our project.

38
00:02:07,239 --> 00:02:09,909
We should be ready to run our app,
right?

39
00:02:09,909 --> 00:02:11,250
Well, not quite.

40
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:14,099
You'll notice that if you try
to run the app, it won't build.

41
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:18,389
Because among other things,
it cannot find a module for Firebase.

42
00:02:18,389 --> 00:02:19,719
So, what's missing?

43
00:02:19,719 --> 00:02:20,849
That's what we'll learn about next.
