00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:02,700
Let's first take a look
at these screenshots and

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:04,680
see what we don't really like.

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:08,070
First of all, it's not very clear
that this is a running game.

4
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:11,270
It just mentions this
in the last image and

5
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:15,460
the first screenshot isn't great because
it describes crystals that are appearing

6
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:17,790
but the text really obscures
a lot of the screen.

7
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:22,450
In the second screenshot there's
a lot of small things going on and

8
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:27,480
it's kind of confusing and the third
shot is just a boring intro screen.

9
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,600
It doesn't show anything
special about gameplay.

10
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:34,530
So these screenshots need to be
more clear and less crowded and

11
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:36,680
focus on the game features.

12
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:39,550
They could also benefit from some
explanatory text that doesn't

13
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:40,940
show up in the center of the screen.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,180
So always design your
screenshots to be clear and

15
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:45,990
highlight interesting game features.
