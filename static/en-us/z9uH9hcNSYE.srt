1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,200
So now let's get back to our retina.

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:02,920
So here we are.

3
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:07,480
So we, we've sort of talked, you know,
very briefly about the photo detectors.

4
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:09,410
Now we're going to talk
about the ganglion cells.

5
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:13,900
One of the things about the ganglion
cells is that they take

6
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:18,550
information from these things called
these horizontal and bipolar cells and

7
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:22,920
the horizontal cells just as you might
think they take information across

8
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:27,300
a local area and bring them
together to the ganglion cells.

9
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,510
So you might ask why would you do that.

10
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:30,960
>> Why would you do that?

11
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:31,980
>> Thank you, Megan.

12
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:32,729
Okay.

13
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:34,310
There are a lot of reasons.

14
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:36,900
One of which has to do
with dynamic range.

15
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:39,570
In fact, you know what,
let's go to this picture first, and

16
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:40,970
then we'll go to the numbers.

17
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:45,200
So here's a series of photographs
where you adjust the amount of light

18
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,330
coming into the image from a thousandth
of a second to a quarter of a second.

19
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:52,880
You see here there's an outdoor
part of the scene right there.

20
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:56,830
So a thousandth of a second isn't enough
when you open it up a little bit more it

21
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:58,560
gets a little bit easier
to see these things.

22
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:02,870
And then as I let in enough light that
I can see the interior really well

23
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:05,290
this outdoor thing is totally blown out.

24
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:08,830
And yet, if you were to stand there,

25
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:11,050
what you would see is something
that looks like this.

26
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:14,570
You'd have no problem seeing
the indoor stuff and outdoor stuff.

27
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:20,470
It might be a little bit harder to see,
but not anything like the camera and

28
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:25,355
that's because your system deals with
dynamic range so much more effectively.

29
00:01:25,355 --> 00:01:26,690
Okay.

30
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:30,890
Here's another example of photographing
a high dynamic range scene.

31
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:34,170
Right, so, if you wanted to see
the stained glass really well you'd

32
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:36,140
have to miss the rest of
the inside of the church.

33
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:38,110
If you want to see the rest
of the inside of the church

34
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:39,570
these things get blown out.

35
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:41,830
But you would have no
problem seeing this.

36
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:45,930
You would see that beautiful stained
glass, and you would see the church.

37
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:48,630
You now know that there
are a couple of photography methods

38
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:51,470
called high dynamic range, so you have
a high dynamic range on your iPhone, or

39
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:54,430
your little phone, or whatever, or
in Photoshop, something like that.

40
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:58,050
That's a way of blending together
a series of pictures to automatically

41
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:03,304
select which regions from which
image should be selected,

42
00:02:03,304 --> 00:02:07,730
or, or how much you dial up or
dial down each region of, of the image

43
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:11,230
in order to composite the whole thing
into a high dynamic range image.
