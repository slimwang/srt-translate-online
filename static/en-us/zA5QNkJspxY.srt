00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:01,940
Hi Michael.
>> Hey Charles, how's it going?

2
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:03,460
>> It's going quite well,
how's it going with you?

3
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:04,110
>> Good.
Good.

4
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:05,138
>> Good Good.

5
00:00:05,138 --> 00:00:08,761
So, today I thought we would talk
a little bit about the philosophy of

6
00:00:08,761 --> 00:00:09,762
Machine Learning.

7
00:00:09,762 --> 00:00:11,620
>> Oh, I hate philosophy.

8
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:14,406
>> I don't like it much either,
although I am a doctor of philosophy.

9
00:00:14,406 --> 00:00:15,451
>> Oh, that's very impressive.

10
00:00:15,451 --> 00:00:16,910
>> Aren't you a doctor
of philosophy too?

11
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:17,809
>> I am, it's kind of impressive.

12
00:00:17,809 --> 00:00:19,145
>> It is kind of impressive.

13
00:00:19,145 --> 00:00:22,245
So what we wanted to kind of get across
today was a little bit about why we,

14
00:00:22,245 --> 00:00:24,300
the class is structured the way it is.

15
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:25,070
What the different parts are.

16
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:26,830
And maybe go a little bit of back and

17
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:30,189
forth about what we think you should
be getting out of the course.

18
00:00:30,189 --> 00:00:30,886
That seem reasonable?

19
00:00:30,886 --> 00:00:31,490
>> Sure.

20
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:32,276
>> Okay.
Well, so,

21
00:00:32,276 --> 00:00:35,257
first off, by the way, before we get
started, I wanted to thank you for

22
00:00:35,257 --> 00:00:38,458
coming down to Atlanta, and
joining me in these beautiful, studios.

23
00:00:38,458 --> 00:00:40,010
>> Well, it's, it's,
it's very nice to be here.

24
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:41,490
Thank you for inviting me.

25
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:42,770
>> Oh, no, no, thank you for
coming, Michael.

26
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:44,420
>> Thank you for
asking me to do the course.

27
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:45,860
This has been a lot of fun.

28
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:47,460
>> Oh, the whole point was to be able
to do the course with you, Michael.

29
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,033
We like each other, and that's one of
the things that we want you to get,

30
00:00:51,033 --> 00:00:53,322
want to get across in this class,
because we like machine learning.

31
00:00:53,322 --> 00:00:57,485
We've a lot of stuff in common, but I'm
not sure we completely agree on the most

32
00:00:57,485 --> 00:01:01,232
important parts of machine learning and
why we do the things that we do.

33
00:01:01,232 --> 00:01:02,235
>> Hm, all right.

34
00:01:02,235 --> 00:01:04,054
>> So
I think people in the outside world,

35
00:01:04,054 --> 00:01:07,042
Michael, would claim that you're
more theoretical than I am.

36
00:01:07,042 --> 00:01:07,727
>> In theory.

37
00:01:07,727 --> 00:01:10,639
>> In theory, and
I'm more practical than you are.

38
00:01:10,639 --> 00:01:11,593
>> Practically.

39
00:01:11,593 --> 00:01:13,140
>> At least in practice.

40
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:16,046
And hopefully some of that tension
will come out in the class.

41
00:01:16,046 --> 00:01:18,941
But I think in order to see why
that tension works that way,

42
00:01:18,941 --> 00:01:21,250
you have to understand
what machine learning is.

43
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:21,790
So, Michael.

44
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:22,730
>> Right.

45
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:23,600
>> What's machine learning?

46
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,530
>> It's about proving theorems.

47
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:26,624
>> [LAUGH] No.

48
00:01:26,624 --> 00:01:28,469
>> No.
>> I would not say it's about proving

49
00:01:28,469 --> 00:01:32,007
theorems, although proving theorems is
often important in machine learning.

50
00:01:32,007 --> 00:01:32,888
>> I agree with that.

51
00:01:32,888 --> 00:01:34,224
>> Okay.
>> So we're on the same page.

52
00:01:34,224 --> 00:01:35,501
>> We're partially on the same page.

53
00:01:35,501 --> 00:01:37,299
What is machine learning?

54
00:01:37,299 --> 00:01:38,450
>> What is machine learning?

55
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:39,200
>> Give me a definition.

56
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,969
>> So it is computational statistics.

57
00:01:43,969 --> 00:01:45,409
How's that for a definition?

58
00:01:45,409 --> 00:01:46,251
>> That is a definition.

59
00:01:46,251 --> 00:01:47,892
It is wrong on so many levels.

60
00:01:47,892 --> 00:01:50,201
However, a lot of people would
agree with that statement.

61
00:01:50,201 --> 00:01:53,877
They would say that machine learning
is really just applied statistics.

62
00:01:53,877 --> 00:01:54,831
>> Not applied statistics.

63
00:01:54,831 --> 00:01:56,548
Computational statistics.

64
00:01:56,548 --> 00:01:59,563
>> Computationally applied statistics.

65
00:01:59,563 --> 00:02:01,284
I don't like that definition.

66
00:02:01,284 --> 00:02:03,798
I think that it's a bit too narrow.

67
00:02:03,798 --> 00:02:07,034
I think that machine learning
is about this broader notion of

68
00:02:07,034 --> 00:02:10,687
building artifacts,
computational artifacts, typically.

69
00:02:10,687 --> 00:02:12,820
That learn over time
based on experience.

70
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:15,610
And then in particular,
it's not just the act

71
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:19,101
of building these artifacts that matter,
it's the math behind it.

72
00:02:19,101 --> 00:02:20,684
It's the science behind it.

73
00:02:20,684 --> 00:02:22,663
It's the engineering behind it,
and it's the computing behind it.

74
00:02:22,663 --> 00:02:27,324
It's everything that goes into building
intelligent artifacts that almost by

75
00:02:27,324 --> 00:02:29,419
necessity have to learn over time.

76
00:02:29,419 --> 00:02:30,730
You buy that?

77
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:33,750
>> Yeah, so you, you have data, and
you do analysis of the data and

78
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:34,968
try to glean things from the data.

79
00:02:34,968 --> 00:02:40,850
And you used, various kinds of
computational structure to do that,

80
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:42,710
so, computational statistics.

81
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:45,330
>> I don't think that's
computational statistics.
