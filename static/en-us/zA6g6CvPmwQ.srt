00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,710
Many OS vendors don't aim for
the highest certifications.

2
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:07,970
AL7 or A1FDC sec is what you are using.

3
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:12,152
So if they had the highest they
would have to formally verify design

4
00:00:12,152 --> 00:00:13,130
correctness.

5
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:16,770
They would have to implement mandatory
access control, all that stuff.

6
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:22,320
So they're not doing it because of what
reason that two options capture those,

7
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,160
and you check the ones
you think makes sense.
