We have just seen the power, of the Chrome developer tools and how we

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:10,850
can inspect our page, to learn what visual elements correspond to HTML elements.

3
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:14,230
What technology, do you think makes it possible for

4
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:20,330
us to either inspect elements, through the developer tools by hovering over

5
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:26,380
HTML, and seeing which visual element it corresponds to on the page.

6
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:31,650
Or vice versa, to right click on a visual element on our webpage, and

7
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:34,200
find out the HTML tags that compose it.
