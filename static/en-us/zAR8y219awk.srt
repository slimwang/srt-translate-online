1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,800
All right, so it's actually
the appropriately named textSize

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:04,939
that will make the text larger.

3
00:00:04,939 --> 00:00:07,510
Now maybe you thought it was textStyle.

4
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:09,620
TextStyle is actually
an attribute that's used for

5
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:11,590
changing text to either bold or italic.

6
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:13,470
But it doesn't change the size.

7
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:15,180
You might have been
looking at textAlignment,

8
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:18,010
which does things like puts
the text to the left of the view or

9
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:20,180
the right of the view,
or centered in the view.

10
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:23,070
But it is actually textSize,
so once we've determined this,

11
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:25,640
let's go ahead and
make the changes in the code.

12
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:27,570
All right, here I am, in my code.

13
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:31,090
I'm looking at activity main.xml
like I always have been and

14
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:34,290
I'm going to scroll down so
I can see my two TextViews.

15
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:36,660
Okay, So let's go ahead and
add the attribute.

16
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:39,490
Put Android,
the name of the attribute equals.

17
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:41,510
Okay, and now I have to put the value.

18
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:45,520
And if you remember from the quiz
question the value should be 36sp.

19
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:50,300
As always, remember to have
quotes around your value.

20
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:53,670
And you're going to need android:
before the value textSize.

21
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:55,580
Oh yeah, and
don't forget the equals sign.

22
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:58,860
Once you've done this, you should be
able to go over here to the preview

23
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:02,930
screen and see that the text
has actually gotten bigger.

24
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:05,700
Let's go ahead and
make this text larger as well.

25
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:06,250
Okay, great.

26
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:09,610
And I've typed my textSize="36sp" here.

27
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:12,260
And I see that it in fact,
updated on the phone.

28
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:14,980
But, in reality,
this isn't your actual phone.

29
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:16,240
So you should always, always,

30
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,940
always run it on your phone to
make sure it looks correct.

31
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:24,905
To do that, I go up here to the green
run button, select my phone and hit OK.

32
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:27,330
And good work, you've done it.

33
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:30,680
We no longer have small microtext,
we have big and

34
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:34,720
beautiful 36 sp text
displayed on our phone.

35
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,000
And just like that, we can check off
text is much larger on our list.
