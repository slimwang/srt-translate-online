1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,924
Suppose you want to do
a broadcast on a 2-D network.

2
00:00:03,924 --> 00:00:06,000
Here are two schemes.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,720
In the first scheme, you run
a tree-based algorithm broadcast in each

4
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:14,070
row followed by a tree-based
broadcast algorithm in each column.

5
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:16,004
The second scheme has four steps.

6
00:00:16,004 --> 00:00:19,461
Scatter in the rows,
followed by a scatter in the columns,

7
00:00:19,461 --> 00:00:22,226
followed by a bucket all
gather in the columns,

8
00:00:22,226 --> 00:00:24,810
followed by a bucket
all gather in the rows.

9
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:27,905
Stop for a minute and convince yourself
that these two schemes are plausible.

10
00:00:28,995 --> 00:00:31,851
Then once you've done that,
I want you to answer this question.

11
00:00:31,851 --> 00:00:36,325
Which scheme has the lowest alpha
term if you estimate the cost?

12
00:00:36,325 --> 00:00:38,295
Is it Scheme 1 or Scheme 2?

13
00:00:38,295 --> 00:00:39,055
