1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
And quite interestingly, we inverted the sign,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
so all of a sudden the function is negative.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Quite obviously, green is the correct answer.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
So, now we have a quadratic that points down into the negative space

5
00:00:11,000 --> 99:59:59,999
whose maximum value is 0 and otherwise, it's strictly negative. That's this function f over here.
