1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
And the answer is 14.14 m, which is the same as 10 m * √2.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
And you see, we know that the old variance would be a 100 m², the µ thinks

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
therefore, it's 200 m² because I told you that just add up.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
If we go to the standard deviation, we take the square root of this.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
This factors into 2*100 m², so we take the square root of this,

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
we get back the 10 m on the right side and you get the √2 on the left side,

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
which gives me the 14.14 m for the standard deviation.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
That's interesting--standard deviations don't add up, variances add up

9
00:00:38,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and that was a non-trivial question.
