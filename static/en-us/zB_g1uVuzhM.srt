1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Now, let's give you a chance to solve a game.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
This will be another 2x2 game,

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
and let's just go ahead and call the players max and min,

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and they each have 2 moves,

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
and we'll make this be a zero-sum game.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
We'll just show the value to max,

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
and the value to min will be the negation of that.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
And what I want you to do to solve the game

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
is tell me what the strategy should be

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
in terms of fill in these blanks.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
What are the percentages that min should play 1 or 2?

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
And in these blanks, the percentages for max to play 1 or 2.

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
And then tell me the final value for the game.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 99:59:59,999
The utility or expected value to max equals what?
