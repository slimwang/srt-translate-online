00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,990
Suppose we're creating
a chat application,

2
00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:05,430
where we have a list
of available friends.

3
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:07,370
Our array might look
something like this.

4
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:12,940
We want to use Ruby to print out
the name of each friend in the array.

5
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:16,530
If we only have five friends online,
it's not too bad.

6
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:19,930
But what if we have 500 friends online,
or 1000 friends?

7
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:24,070
Wow, that's a lot of repeated code.

8
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:28,860
Fortunately, there's a better
way to do this, loops.

9
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:33,690
Loops are a feature built into Ruby that
helps us reduce code duplication and

10
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:34,700
lets us repeat things.

11
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:36,640
In this session,

12
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,979
we'll learn about some of the important
loops that Ruby ships with.

13
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:46,230
And by the end of this session, we'll
see a few ways to take these 500 plus

14
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:51,220
lines of code and reduce it down
to this beautiful single line.

15
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:53,440
All right, let's get started.
