00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:03,352
Direct interaction, where for example, you use the mouse to control or

2
00:00:03,352 --> 00:00:08,048
influence what's happening in the scene, is handled using events. An event is

3
00:00:08,048 --> 00:00:12,170
generated by the system whenever a user presses a key or uses the mouse. There

4
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:14,898
are other kinds of events, but these two, keyboard and mouse input, are the

5
00:00:14,898 --> 00:00:18,991
main ones we care about in Three.js. Well, I should mention there's also a

6
00:00:18,991 --> 00:00:21,738
touch interface that's somewhat similar to the mouse interface, so that you can

7
00:00:21,738 --> 00:00:25,774
interact with scenes on a smart phone, or other touch-sensitive display. You

8
00:00:25,774 --> 00:00:29,702
can ignore any and all events or can listen for any you wish. Here's code for

9
00:00:29,702 --> 00:00:32,650
listening to a mouse click event, specifically mouse down, which means when the

10
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:35,839
mouse is first clicked. If you want to wait until the mouse button was

11
00:00:35,839 --> 00:00:39,222
released, you would listen for mouse up. The addListener event takes a function

12
00:00:39,222 --> 00:00:43,450
name as an input. Whenever the mouse button is clicked this function is called.

13
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:47,180
This code defines the function called on mouse down. This preventDefault line

14
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:50,660
is optional. It makes your program not past the mouse event on up to the page

15
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:55,068
running your javascript program. I usually don't use this call. The rest of

16
00:00:55,068 --> 00:00:58,093
this function is up to you. A mouse or key click could modify an object, start

17
00:00:58,093 --> 00:01:02,456
an animation, you name it. Enough talk. What follows is an example of using the

18
00:01:02,456 --> 00:01:06,840
mouse down event to perform picking. You are orbiting around a bunch of blocks.

19
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,159
Try clicking on a block as you move past them.
