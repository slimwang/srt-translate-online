1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The correct answer is:

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The numeral "1"--the digit--appears.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Let's go ahead and see this, for real.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Okay. Here we are in our browser.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
We've got "the number one" selected.

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
When I click Submit, I see "q" equals the numeral "1"

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
because that's what we specified in the value parameter.

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
And if we selected one of these other options--

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
let's go with "three" this time--

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
when I click Submit, we see "q" equals the word "three"

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
because that's what was the contents of the Option parameter.

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
And if you don't specify a value,

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
the value of the "q" parameter in the URL will default

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
to the contents of the Option elements.

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
So if you want to have a different value in the URL--

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
that's different from the contents of the Option element--

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
that's what the value parameter is for.
