For quadratic inequalities, we can show the solution in one of two ways. On a

2
00:00:04,481 --> 00:00:08,243
number line, we know that these values satisfy the inequality and these values

3
00:00:08,243 --> 00:00:13,894
do as well. We use parentheses at x equals negative 3 and x equals, 4 since we

4
00:00:13,894 --> 00:00:20,135
know these numbers make the equation equal to 0. These two numbers would not be

5
00:00:20,135 --> 00:00:23,584
part of the solution set. The other way we can write our solution set is in

6
00:00:23,584 --> 00:00:27,666
interval notation. Keep in mind, since we have two non-overlapping regions,

7
00:00:27,666 --> 00:00:32,334
we'll need to use the union symbol in between the two intervals. What I want

8
00:00:32,334 --> 00:00:35,470
you to do is to fill in each of these boxes using the correct interval

9
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:39,945
notation. Be sure to use parenthesis or brackets and include the infinity

10
00:00:39,945 --> 00:00:43,250
symbol or the numbers as necessary. Good luck.
