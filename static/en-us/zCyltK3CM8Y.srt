1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:03,945
Now directly, the physics body itself exposes a function that allows us to set

2
00:00:03,945 --> 00:00:08,762
a linear velocity vector on it. The trick here however is properly constructing

3
00:00:08,762 --> 00:00:12,142
this velocity vector such that it does the right thing as the physics engine is

4
00:00:12,142 --> 00:00:17,237
moving. Now your job during this next quiz is to properly fill in the move_dir

5
00:00:17,237 --> 00:00:22,462
vector with input from the user. Such that setLinearVelocity will do the right

6
00:00:22,462 --> 00:00:24,810
thing over the next few frames.
