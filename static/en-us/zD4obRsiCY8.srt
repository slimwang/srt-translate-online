00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,033
So, did you get 94? Because that's the correct answer. Let's review the steps,

2
00:00:05,142 --> 00:00:09,922
and see how we got that answer. When you want to replace the variables with

3
00:00:09,934 --> 00:00:14,592
their values, remember to use parentheses. After I substitute negative 2 in for

4
00:00:14,604 --> 00:00:19,055
x, 2 in for y And negative 3 in for z, this is what I get 4 times negative 2 to

5
00:00:19,067 --> 00:00:23,955
the 2nd power, negative 2 times negative 3 plus 3 times negative 2 times 2

6
00:00:23,967 --> 00:00:29,005
squared times negative 3. Once again, we need to use order of operations to

7
00:00:29,017 --> 00:00:34,117
evaluate this expression. First, I want to evaluate my exponents or my powers. I

8
00:00:34,217 --> 00:00:38,325
have two exponents, I have two squared here. And I have negative 2 squared here,

9
00:00:38,434 --> 00:00:41,098
negative 2 sqyared is negative 2 times negative 2 which is 4. Remember to copy

10
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:46,319
down the rest of the operations that you haven't performed whenever you're doing

11
00:00:46,331 --> 00:00:50,967
order of operations. I also evaluated 2 squared and gave me 4. Now that there's

12
00:00:50,979 --> 00:00:55,972
no exponents in my expression I can perform my multiplication and division in

13
00:00:55,984 --> 00:01:00,969
order from left to right. First I have 4 times 4 which is 16. Then I have

14
00:01:00,981 --> 00:01:03,896
negative 2 times negative 3 which is positive 6. Now I can multiply these four

15
00:01:03,908 --> 00:01:09,028
numbers together. Feel free to get out your calculator. Now that I've performed

16
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:13,922
all of the multiplication and division, I can go to addition and subtraction.

17
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:18,766
Once again, I do everything in order from left to right. 16 plus 6 is 22 plus 72

18
00:01:18,778 --> 00:01:24,375
gives us 94. If you're having difficulty, feel free to go back and review some

19
00:01:24,387 --> 00:01:29,959
of the videos and try again. If you feel comfortable with the material, let's

20
00:01:29,971 --> 00:01:30,495
move on.
