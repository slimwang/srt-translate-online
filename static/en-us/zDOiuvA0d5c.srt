1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,880
Something else that was
observed about moving lights.

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:06,700
So I'm showing you this picture, and
you probably don't see very much.

3
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:08,590
So you probably don't know what this is.

4
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:11,980
To me it's obviously a horse
jumping over a fence.

5
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:14,890
Except when I put it in motion, oh.

6
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:16,950
It's Meghan strolling along.

7
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:17,998
She has such a nice stroll.

8
00:00:17,998 --> 00:00:20,680
No it's not, it's just some set of
random dots from some other exhibit.

9
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:23,443
Notice that that center point is fixed.

10
00:00:23,443 --> 00:00:25,370
It's not moving at all.

11
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:27,410
And, in fact, if I erase that and
look at that,

12
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:31,150
and you just stare at that point,
the whole thing looks kind of weird.

13
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:32,950
But then if you just stop
looking at that point and

14
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:35,130
just look at the whole thing,
you see somebody moving.

15
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:38,670
Except now I can't get that weird
center point out of my head, all right?

16
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:42,020
But the idea is with this
very impoverished stimulus,

17
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:44,770
you are able to perceive
not just motion.

18
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:48,870
Remember, nothing is moving here, right?

19
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:51,318
There are no points
moving on the screen.

20
00:00:51,318 --> 00:00:55,310
Point, point, point.

21
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:57,050
You see them moving.

22
00:00:57,050 --> 00:01:01,180
Not only do you see points moving,
you see a person moving.

23
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:06,530
All there are are static
pictures of points.

24
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:08,380
That's all that's there.

25
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:11,960
The rest of what's going on is
being manufactured in your head.

26
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:16,020
And our goal, because we're
computational vision people,

27
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:19,710
is to think a little bit about how to
get the computer to manufacture some of

28
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:20,470
that information.
