1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,950
All right, so with that, there are lots
of other examples that I could come up

2
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:04,770
with and we could talk about.

3
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:07,394
But I think that, I think I've
sort of made the point here.

4
00:00:07,394 --> 00:00:08,600
>> Yeah, that's really neat.

5
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:14,560
I mean, again, it feels,
not to be dissing on my homie,

6
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:16,430
King Solomon, but-
>> Namesake.

7
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:16,935
>> Namesake.

8
00:00:16,935 --> 00:00:18,636
>> Mm-hm.
>> Isn't that what homie means?

9
00:00:18,636 --> 00:00:22,080
>> In some, in Yiddish, yes.

10
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,410
>> [LAUGH] Okay, fine.

11
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:27,600
So, but again, if B is rich enough,

12
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:32,159
B is just buying the baby and not even
paying A appropriately for the baby.

13
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:34,930
>> Well, if B is rich enough,
B probably just bought a baby.

14
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:40,010
>> Yeah, but bought the baby for
the, [LAUGH] for

15
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:43,660
what, for the value, for
B's own value of the baby.

16
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:47,074
>> So, it has to be the case that V real
is greater than V fake for all of this.

17
00:00:47,074 --> 00:00:47,610
>> Yeah.

18
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:48,660
>> But let's just say it is.

19
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:50,540
And if it's not, then we'll
come up with some other design.

20
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:53,345
And actually, by the way,
there are mechanisms for

21
00:00:53,345 --> 00:00:57,234
solving this where it may be the case
that fake's greater than real, but

22
00:00:57,234 --> 00:01:00,358
you sort of limit the possible
values that each might get,

23
00:01:00,358 --> 00:01:03,500
you kind of think there's
like a distribution of them.

24
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,780
And there are clever things that you
can do to sort of make this work.

25
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:12,390
But well beyond the scope of this single
slide, which we've done all of this on

26
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:14,900
one slide, so it's well beyond-
>> All of this and a little more.

27
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:17,280
>> Yeah, there's just no
more room on the slide, so

28
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,586
I can't talk about it anymore.

29
00:01:19,586 --> 00:01:21,000
>> [LAUGH]
>> So,

30
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,910
I think speaking of game theory and
true values, we have a problem.

31
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:24,780
>> All right, what's the problem?

32
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:29,330
>> The problem we have is that we've now
come to the part of the lesson where we

33
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:34,210
have to say what have we learned, and
one of us drives and the other talks.

34
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:34,730
>> Great.
>> But

35
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:37,240
we both did things in this lesson.

36
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:40,660
>> So, I'm going to say that

37
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:45,120
we kept switching turns in
order to make parity work.

38
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,850
You should do the what have we learned.
