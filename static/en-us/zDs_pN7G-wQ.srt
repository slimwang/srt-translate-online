1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:03,660
I've refreshed the page and
cleared up the console.

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:04,670
You should do the same so

3
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:07,600
that way you can start from
the same base point as me.

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:11,480
We're going to be working together to
apply what we've learned about visual

5
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:16,800
codings and D3's basic functionality
to build part of a visualization.

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,980
The visualization is called Gapminder
and it's a scatter plot that shows

7
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:26,610
different aspects about countries,
including their population In size,

8
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:30,740
income per person, and
life expectancy in years.

9
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:33,810
Now the specific thing that we're
going to rebuild about this plot

10
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:35,000
is China.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,090
We're going to plot
China in the year 2015.

12
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:43,260
So we'll basically want to create this
red dot in the same sort of position

13
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:44,660
as it is laid out in this chart.

14
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:48,900
Here's a look at what you'll
create by the end of this lesson.

15
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:51,250
Now, it doesn't look like much,
but there's so

16
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:53,870
much that goes in just
creating this one circle.

17
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:56,760
And, believe it or not,
once you know how to create one circle,

18
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:00,900
you'll have an arsenal of tools
to develop other visualizations.

19
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:06,080
So, let's get started by clearing some
area on this current page for a chart.

20
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,410
I'm going to inspect this
main content area over here.

21
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:13,880
And it looks like we have a container,
a title and a main content area.

22
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:17,510
Now, if I wanted to I could use D3's

23
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:21,010
remove method to remove this
DOM node from the page.

24
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:24,360
But I actually don't want to
remove the element from the page,

25
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:28,000
instead I just want to remove
the inner HTML content.

26
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,570
So, I want to remove this row.

27
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:33,770
Let's see if you can figure this
out by using D3's documentation.

28
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:39,650
Write one line of code to empty
the main content area of the display.

29
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:43,200
You want to keep the div that
has a class of main on it, and

30
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,400
you'll need to use a new D3 method
that we haven't seen before.
