[Narrator] Hi class, this is homework assignment #6 on SLAM,

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
and we're going to practice some more questions about the graph SLAM algorithm,

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:18,000
and I will ask you something new about how to make graph SLAM more efficient

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
towards the end of this homework assignment.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
There's 3 questions and 1 new thing,

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
which comes with additional questions and a programming assignment.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Let's dive in.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
In this example, picture a robot that starts at initial position 5.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
This robot which lives in 1D, even though I'm drawing this in 2D,

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
sees a landmark with a relative measurement of 2.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
It then moves to coordinate X1 by taking a step of 7.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,000
It now sees a different landmark, L1, with a measurement value of 4.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Finally, it moves again with a motion 2,

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
and now it sees the same second landmark, not the original one,at a value of 2.

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Obviously, when I work it out and solve this,

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
you find that the best coordinates over here are 12 and 14,

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
with landmark coordinates of 7 and 16,

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
but none of the numbers I just told you will be inserted in the question I'm about to ask.

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Picture the matrix omega and the vector C.

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I want you to add all these constraints into omega

21
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
with a caveat that for the initial constraint I assume the strength is just 1,

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
so enter it the way you're used to.

23
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Now let's assume the motion update has a sigma of 1,

24
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,000
but the measurement update--the sigma for measurements has a value of 0.5,

25
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
and remember we weigh those updates with 1 over sigma,

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
which in the measurement case would therefore be 2.

27
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I want you to fill in the values for sigma and for C for this specific example.

28
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I gave you some of the sigma values and some of the C values,

29
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
and I want you to fill in the missing values over here.

30
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:13,000
You can check whether you got them correct by verifying that I got those numbers correct,

31
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
and you can also solve for omega minus 1 times C,

32
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,000
and out should come the right positions shown in the diagram over here.
