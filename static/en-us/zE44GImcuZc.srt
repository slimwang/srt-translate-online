1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
So the other approach for solving this is what's known as an auditing mix net,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:11,000
and the idea here is that each participant in the mix net can audit some of the outputs of the next step.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
So to do that, we need to provide extra inputs.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
So instead of the voter just providing the vote as encrypted to party A,

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
they'll provide it to party B as well.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
All of the incoming votes go to the next two steps.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:33,000
And now B going to audit A and it does that by picking some random set of inputs.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:41,000
So let's say it picks this one and it picks this one, and it picks some of the ones in here.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
So that means it's looking at some A's ouputs, and we'll call these y values.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
So this would be y2, this would be y something else, and this would be y of n-1.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
All right. And this would be y of n.

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
So for each of the n inputs, Bob picks some number to audit.

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
And what B does is ask A to prove that y2 is a valid input.

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
In order to prove this, what does A need to provide?

15
00:01:07,000 --> 99:59:59,999
What must A provide to B in order to prove that y2 is a valid output from A's mix net?
