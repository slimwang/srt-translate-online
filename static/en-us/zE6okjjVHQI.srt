00:00:00,303 --> 00:00:04,471
So tell us about what dynamic parallelism adds to the CUDA programming model.

2
00:00:04,471 --> 00:00:09,446
>> So quite simply, it lets you launch kernels directly from inside another kernel,

3
00:00:09,446 --> 00:00:18,094
and that sounds relatively simple. If you like the analogy on the CPU side is when I could create threads inside of process.

4
00:00:18,094 --> 00:00:20,766
Instead of having to go back to the operating system to initiate a new process,

5
00:00:20,766 --> 00:00:25,196
I can suddenly spawn a P thread and do something asynchronously within the single process that I have,

6
00:00:25,196 --> 00:00:27,297
manage that all from within my own process.

7
00:00:27,297 --> 00:00:31,465
I can now do that on the GPU as well. I can create work and not just single threads,

8
00:00:31,465 --> 00:00:37,307
I create whole grids from inside of my GPU. So if my problem is working on something,

9
00:00:37,307 --> 00:00:42,140
and I suddenly need to invert a matrix or perform a Fourier transform or something,

10
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:46,619
I can suddenly just call out into a kernel which does that for me, returns the data,

11
00:00:46,619 --> 00:00:55,558
and I can continue so I can embed parallel work exactly where I need it with the data that I have available inside my program.

12
00:00:55,558 --> 00:01:02,595
Sort of corollary to that is this idea of being able to take data that dynamically you are working on,

13
00:01:02,595 --> 00:01:07,999
a value that you have sort of mathematically, algorithmically generated,

14
00:01:07,999 --> 00:01:13,677
and use that value to make decisions on work you're going to do.

15
00:01:13,677 --> 00:01:17,410
If my value is 1 do this, if it's 2, do that.

16
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:20,823
Or maybe I am partitioning a problem, I am building a tree,

17
00:01:20,823 --> 00:01:22,714
spatially partitioning something.

18
00:01:22,714 --> 00:01:27,052
If I have a certain number of things in one place and a larger number in another place,

19
00:01:27,052 --> 00:01:29,922
I can dynamically launch the correct number of threads to do that,

20
00:01:29,922 --> 00:01:35,663
and the ability to do this on the fly dynamically is really the power of this dynamic parallelism.
