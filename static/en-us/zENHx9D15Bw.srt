1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,050
The accelerometer is
an incredibly flexible and

2
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:06,870
intuitive way for
your user to interact with your game.

3
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:10,120
The accelerometer reports
the phone's acceleration in meters

4
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:11,640
per second squared.

5
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:13,440
So if the phone is stationary,

6
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:17,460
the only acceleration it's experiencing
is the acceleration due to gravity,

7
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:20,180
which is equal to about 9.8
meters per second squared.

8
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:23,390
Does this sound at all
familiar from physics class?

9
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:27,500
Now regardless of the orientation
used by your game, the accelerometer

10
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:30,960
data is reported as though the phone
is in portrait orientation,

11
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,660
with the positive z-axis
coming out of the screen.

12
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:36,860
That means if the z-axis of
the accelerometer is reading about 9.8,

13
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:39,660
the phone is flat on its back.

14
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:45,060
If the z axis is reading negative 9.8,
then the phone is resting on it's face.

15
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:50,210
If the y axis reads 9.8 then the phone
is upright in the portrait orientation.

16
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:54,590
Note we have tilted the phone a little
bit and the y axis is reading positive.

17
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:58,710
If we tilt the phone this way a little
bit, now the x axis is reading positive.

18
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:00,690
Libgdx allows you to pull for

19
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:05,880
accelerometer readings using gdx
input get accelerometer x, y and z.

20
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:10,130
We can compute the total acceleration
using the good old Pythagorean theorem.

21
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:12,705
Down here we're drawing
those red bars you saw, and

22
00:01:12,705 --> 00:01:15,035
this is actually the horizontal bar.

23
00:01:15,035 --> 00:01:17,855
Notice the x position
of the end of that bar

24
00:01:17,855 --> 00:01:20,995
is being determined by
the negative y axis.

25
00:01:20,995 --> 00:01:23,820
That's because we're looking at
this game in landscape mode.

26
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:26,610
And all of the accelerometer readings
are reported as though the phone

27
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:27,420
was in portrait mode.

28
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:29,900
Here is the vertical line.

29
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:34,140
And the end of that line is
determined by the positive x axis.

30
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:35,900
You'll get a hold of
this quickly enough.

31
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:39,330
But if everything is sliding sideways
in your game, this is probably why.
