00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,520
In this lesson we looked at
distributed file systems and

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:07,320
described the use of caching and
accompanying mechanisms

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:11,210
to provide optimized file
access performance on one side.

4
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:16,170
And also to maintain meaningful
file-sharing semantics on the other.

5
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:19,000
We looked at the specific
decisions made in NFS and

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,140
the sprite distributed file system.

7
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:24,720
And for sprite we looked how
its design was motivated

8
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:29,030
by certain observations regarding
file usage and file access patterns.
