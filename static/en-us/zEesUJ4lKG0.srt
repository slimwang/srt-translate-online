1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,570
So an additional help in thinking about your value proposition

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:06,680
comes from a great VC, Ann Miura-Ko, at Floodgate.

3
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:12,220
Ann said, "We can think of startups' value propositions of having 2 forms."

4
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:15,980
"Do they have technology insight, or are they market insights?"

5
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:19,640
And typically, technology insights come for technology-driven products.

6
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:21,820
Are you building chips that follow Moore's Law--

7
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:24,230
that is, they're now doubling in density every year

8
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:26,750
and therefore new functions can be embedded in them?

9
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:30,310
Are these based on new scientific discoveries or new algorithms?

10
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:33,580
Typically, this applies to hardware or clean tech and biotech,

11
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:36,250
but it also could be big data algorithms, etc.

12
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:39,670
Do you have some insight about technology

13
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:44,140
and, again, the gains and pains that that will provide for customers?

14
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:49,290
Or do you have some insight about the market or consumer behavior?

15
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:51,400
Are you going to disrupt the value chain

16
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:54,630
because you now understand how to do something overseas

17
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:57,910
where you could slash the cost by 80%?

18
00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:02,380
Is there something that government regulation or deregulation is going to change

19
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:06,910
and now make an entire industry available in a way it never was before?

20
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:10,380
So these are about changes in how people work and live and interact

21
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:15,310
and what they expect, and these are very different than technology insights.

22
00:01:15,310 --> 99:59:59,999
But remember they both need to solve pains and gains for your customer.
