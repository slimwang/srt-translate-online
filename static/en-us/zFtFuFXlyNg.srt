00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,160
>> Now let's take a little deeper look at what is contained inside of the data

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:08,671
array. Now, if you recall, each layer is actually a large two-dimensional grid

3
00:00:08,671 --> 00:00:12,800
of tile data. It's listed here in the JSON file as a single integer array.

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:17,558
Effectively, this is what we call raster scan order, where each row is listed in

5
00:00:17,558 --> 00:00:22,332
the file after the previous row, linearly. The value of each element in the data

6
00:00:22,332 --> 00:00:27,074
array actually has significance in itself. First off, if you see a zero value

7
00:00:27,074 --> 00:00:32,090
that effectively means that no tile has been placed in that x,y position inside

8
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:36,546
of this layer. Any non-zero value represents a tile index for a given atlas.

9
00:00:36,546 --> 00:00:41,142
Now, this is where things start to get a little bit tricky. Now, if you recall,

10
00:00:41,142 --> 00:00:45,832
this little element here, first GID, that exists for each atlas that's listed in

11
00:00:45,832 --> 00:00:50,005
our tile sets array. Now, if a zero value in the data array for a layer, it

12
00:00:50,005 --> 00:00:54,025
means that there is no tile there. That means that the first element to

13
00:00:54,025 --> 00:00:58,326
represent that a tile does exist must start with one. Each atlas that exists

14
00:00:58,326 --> 00:01:02,659
inside of the tiled file will have an increasing first GID. Now, tiled has its

15
00:01:02,659 --> 00:01:07,015
own heuristics on what the first GID should be for each subsequent atlas that's

16
00:01:07,015 --> 00:01:11,496
loaded. We won't get into that other than to say that you need to know what this

17
00:01:11,496 --> 00:01:16,351
number is. So, what we see here is that if we have a value of 167 in this data

18
00:01:16,351 --> 00:01:21,565
array, and the first GID of the atlas starts with 1, this effectively means that

19
00:01:21,565 --> 00:01:26,859
167 is the first atlas, tile number 166. Now, this makes a little bit more sense

20
00:01:26,859 --> 00:01:32,140
once you start getting 4 or 5 different atlas layers on there. Right now, it may

21
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:37,337
seem a little bit [unknown]. The larger issue that you have to run into is what

22
00:01:37,337 --> 00:01:42,084
does 166 actually mean. Now, recall once again that the atlas that's being given

23
00:01:42,084 --> 00:01:45,983
to us is in raster scan order as well. So, the value of 166 is actually the

24
00:01:45,983 --> 00:01:50,066
raster index into the 2-dimensional array. With this set up, computing the

25
00:01:50,066 --> 00:01:54,162
coordinates for the atlas simply involves mapping the tile size to the right

26
00:01:54,162 --> 00:01:55,975
offset inside the atlas itself.
