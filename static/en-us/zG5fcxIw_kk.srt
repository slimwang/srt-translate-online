1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:05,280
Now let's analyze the security of the
Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm.

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:10,720
First, we observe that the shared key,
meaning the shared secret,

3
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:16,410
that is computed by both users A and
B, itself is never transmitted.

4
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:22,490
Further, the local secret of user A or
B itself is also not transmitted.

5
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:27,260
That is, the local secret,
XA, is kept to user A, and

6
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:31,300
the local secret, XB, is kept to user B.

7
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:35,820
In summary,
no secret value is being transmitted.

8
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:40,300
On the other hand, the values you and
YB are transmitted.

9
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:46,900
Then the question is from you which is
alpha raised to the power of XA mod q.

10
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:49,750
And given that alpha and q and

11
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:55,220
you are known can
an emissary compute xa?

12
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:56,590
The security assumption here,

13
00:00:56,590 --> 00:01:02,310
is that this grid algorithm when large
number is involved is very hard.

14
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:07,160
That is given y, alpha, and
q, it is extremely hard to

15
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:12,680
compute the value of x, or
it is not practical to compute x.

16
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:15,680
Because q is a very large prime.

17
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,900
For example, q is a least 300 bit long.

18
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:23,240
On the other hand,
if this conjecture is not true,

19
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:27,700
that means an adversary knowing you and
knowing alpha and q,

20
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:33,910
can easily compute xa which is
the local secret to user a.

21
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:37,822
This would mean that
the adversary can compute

22
00:01:37,822 --> 00:01:42,660
secret key as they're shared between
user A and B, just like user A.

23
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:46,440
Because now, the adversary knows
the local secret of user A.
