00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,856
So far in this lesson we've discussed sensory memory, short-term or working

2
00:00:03,856 --> 00:00:08,090
memory, and long-term memory. We've also discussed the differing areas of the

3
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:11,226
brain that are associated with different types of memory such as implicit or

4
00:00:11,226 --> 00:00:16,360
explicit memory. One thing we haven't touched on yet is how emotions can play a

5
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:21,060
role in remembering a particular life event. Now think back to your own life

6
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:24,998
and an emotional situation that you remember. Whether graduating from high

7
00:00:24,998 --> 00:00:29,266
school or college, or your first date, or even the funeral of a loved one. Why

8
00:00:29,266 --> 00:00:32,594
is it that we can remember details of these events, but we can't remember what

9
00:00:32,594 --> 00:00:38,172
we wore to the gym two days ago. Well as it turns out, emotions play a key role

10
00:00:38,172 --> 00:00:42,820
in remembering and retrieving information. Let's go take a closer look at this.
