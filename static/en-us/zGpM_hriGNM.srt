1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:05,100
This whole thing falls under the labeling of geometric camera Calibration.

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:08,270
In order to be able, for the camera to tell us about things in the world,

3
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:12,210
we need to know the geometric relationship between the camera and the world.

4
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:14,736
For reference, you can take a look at the Forsyth and Ponce book.

5
00:00:14,736 --> 00:00:18,220
The sections are, are listed here, and there's a nice description.

6
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:22,170
So as we said, geometric camera calibration's composed of two parts.

7
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:26,220
There's the first part that goes from some arbitrary world coordinate system.

8
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:28,860
You know, put your origin wherever you want it to be to wherever the camera is,

9
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:32,689
and that basically tells you where the camera is in the world and its pose.

10
00:00:32,689 --> 00:00:37,810
And then the second one is from the 3D camera to the image plane.

11
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:40,490
The first one is called the Extrinsic parameters.

12
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:43,268
That's the Extrinsic it goes from the world coordinate system to the,

13
00:00:43,268 --> 00:00:45,020
to the camera coordinate system.

14
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:47,120
The Intrinsic, which we'll do next time,

15
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,510
is from the 3D camera system to the image.

16
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:53,620
So let's talk about camera pose or the orientation and

17
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:56,940
location of the camera frame with respect to the world.

18
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:02,350
In this diagram, this transform T is a transform that goes between the world and

19
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:03,550
the camera system.

20
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:07,960
Okay? And that's what this T with lower, lower w, upper C is going to mean.

21
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:08,610
All right.

22
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:10,805
We're going to talk more about this notation in a minute.

23
00:01:10,805 --> 00:01:13,836
The transformation that we're going to talk about is this going from

24
00:01:13,836 --> 00:01:15,850
world coordinates to camera coordinates.
