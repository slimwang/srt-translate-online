00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:05,410
Before we go on, let me talk about some of the basics of image matching here.

2
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:08,870
Imagine I have an image, small image, right here, and

3
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:13,710
I'm just going to put them on a axis of x and y because we want to look at how

4
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:19,730
various types of transformations on this small example image could be matched or

5
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:23,490
could be actually all, also determined by looking at an image.

6
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:28,470
So imagine in this X and Y plane, this image now has moved over here.

7
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:32,810
In a simple matter, what I'll basically say is that image has now translated.

8
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:37,950
In essence what has changed, is it's value of this image in X and Y.

9
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:40,890
And I can actually use this coordinate axis here.

10
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:44,920
And in essence everything in the image is the same except all values in

11
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:48,060
this image have been changed by change in x and y.

12
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:51,510
And of course some times depending on how I want to do it I may also

13
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:54,850
actually want to also use a frame of reference that is the middle of the image.

14
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:57,750
But again this is just a simple transformation.

15
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:59,750
Another way of looking at these images.

16
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:01,880
Again, this image now could appear and

17
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:05,780
again in the x y plane that we are looking at except now its also got

18
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:10,350
a little bit of an additional transformation which is that now it's rotated.

19
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:13,760
So it basically means that this image now if we were to have these two

20
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:19,020
axes is now appearing here at a different location x and

21
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:23,210
y, but in addition the the change in x and y.

22
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:27,570
There is also a additional change, which would be this angle theta.

23
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:33,350
So of course, now we can refer to this with three different degrees of freedom,

24
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:35,330
x, y, and theta.

25
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:39,580
So this is basically a rotation of the image from here to there,

26
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:41,280
with a translation.

27
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,720
What about this third transformation of an image?

28
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:49,350
Here if you notice this image is translated, moved to a different x and

29
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:52,705
y, but also in the same time it has been rotated.

30
00:01:52,705 --> 00:01:55,810
So theta is different, but it's also smaller.

31
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:58,220
We refer to this transformation as scale.

32
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:03,750
So now we basically have four parameters x, y, theta, and scale radiation.

33
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:05,700
Here is another transformation.

34
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,080
I've moved this again in x and y.

35
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:12,430
And, if you notice, the shape of this image is also kind of different.

36
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:15,120
So, this is usually referred to as an affine transformation,

37
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,720
where in addition to x, y, and the angle, and the scale, we have actually kind

38
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:24,040
of looked at some sort of a simple warp that makes this image look different.

39
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:26,020
Yet another transformation is shown here.

40
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:29,960
This is referred to as a perspective transformation.

41
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,840
That is, now we have taken the image and

42
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,580
also kind of given it a little bit of a perspective warp.

43
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:39,330
So, if you notice now, is things are kind of looking shorter as I

44
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:42,280
go into the image this way, and this is again a transformation.

45
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:45,710
So, now we have actually added another set of degrees of freedom on this image.

46
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:49,200
Now, in essence, to be able to get the image matching going on.

47
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,620
We need to also look for all of these transformations.
