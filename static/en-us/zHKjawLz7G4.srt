1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:05,050
So our next question actually
is about how bad is cybercrime,

2
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:07,960
in particular the cost of cybercrime.

3
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:09,480
People say it's a big problem.

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,690
And people actually try to estimate it.

5
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:16,110
So there's a pointer to
a report that talks about

6
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:19,120
cybercrime in the US and
other countries.

7
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:21,690
So this question is sort of your

8
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:25,370
intuitively what do you think
how big this problem is?

9
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:26,770
If you look at both options,

10
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:31,790
it's in billions of dollars, but
is it tens or is over hundred?

11
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:32,990
Those are the two options
