We said earlier that the square root of the number n is just a number that when

2
00:00:04,878 --> 00:00:09,568
multiplied by itself, gives us n. Let's pick a real number to make this more

3
00:00:09,581 --> 00:00:15,081
concrete for ourselves, though. Right now, I am feeling 3. 3 is the number that

4
00:00:15,093 --> 00:00:20,075
I want to use right now. But what number times itself gives us 3? Well, we just

5
00:00:20,087 --> 00:00:24,595
said that was the whole point of square roots. So clearly, the square root of 3

6
00:00:24,607 --> 00:00:29,270
times the square root of 3 equals 3. But this is interesting. The square root of

7
00:00:29,282 --> 00:00:33,775
3 times the square root of 3 is just the square root of 3 squared. So, what does

8
00:00:33,787 --> 00:00:38,270
this mean for square roots in terms of exponents? What if I wanted to rewrite

9
00:00:38,282 --> 00:00:44,703
this as 3 to some power, all of that squared, equals 3. What number belongs in

10
00:00:44,715 --> 00:00:45,432
this box?
