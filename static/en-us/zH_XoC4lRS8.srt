00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,380
In this lecture, we will talk about the

2
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:07,530
Internet's original design principles. These design principles were

3
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:10,720
discussed in the paper reading for today, the

4
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:14,410
Design Philosophy of the DARPA Internet Protocols, by

5
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:17,970
Dave Clark, dated 1988. The paper has many

6
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:20,820
important lessons and we will go through many

7
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,490
of them as we revisit many of the

8
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:25,280
design decisions. Before we jump into any details

9
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:27,860
let's talk about some of the high level lessons. One

10
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:30,950
of the most important conceptual lessons is that the design

11
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:34,100
principles and priorities were designed for a certain type of

12
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:38,700
network. And as the internet evolves, we are feeling some of

13
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,370
the growing pains of some of those choices. In the

14
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:44,020
last lesson. We talked about a number of the problems

15
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:47,090
and growing pains of the internet. And it's worth bearing

16
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:50,400
in mind that many of the problems that we are seeing

17
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,860
now, are a result of some of the original

18
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:55,330
design choices. Now that's not to say that some of

19
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:57,910
these design choices are right or wrong, but rather that

20
00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:01,190
they simply reflect the nature of our understanding at the

21
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:05,319
time as well as, the environment and constraints that

22
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:09,010
the designers faced for the particular network that existed at

23
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:12,430
that time. Now needless to say, some of the technical

24
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:15,630
lessons. From the original design have turned out to be

25
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:19,730
fairly timeless. One concept is packet switching, which we

26
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:22,370
will discuss in this lesson. And another is the

27
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:24,790
notion of fate sharing, or soft state, which we

28
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:27,300
will discuss in a subsequent lesson in the course.
