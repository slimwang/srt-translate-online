1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,870
What we found, was that people dramatically underestimated the

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:06,300
size of their audience. Typically, they guessed that their audience

3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:08,220
was about a quarter of the size that it

4
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:14,770
actually was. When I first approached this problem, I, plotted

5
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:17,280
a bunch of histograms. I wanted to know how

6
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,650
many people do people think are in their audience. So,

7
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:23,200
the first thing I did was, you know, I opened

8
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:26,070
up R, and in ggplot, I plotted a histogram

9
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:26,960
of people's guesses.
