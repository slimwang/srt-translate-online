00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:03,750
Continuing with thinking about the digital audio, we can

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:07,790
think about sort of music or, or any other way of dealing with audio right?

3
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:11,310
When we record a sound, we have a microphone and

4
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:14,650
a microphone generates out a continuous voltage.

5
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:17,110
By the way, you guys know how a microphone works?

6
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:19,240
More or less a microphone works the following way.

7
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:22,900
We have a permanent magnet and we've got a electric coil alright with

8
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:25,990
some wires in it, and out, out of that coil comes another wire.

9
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:31,870
And usually, the the coil is on a little springy mechanism.

10
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:33,640
The permanent magnets are fixed.

11
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:36,080
You speak and that causes a pressure wave,

12
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:39,100
a press, a pressure wave causes the coil to move back and forth.

13
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:43,710
When you move a coil of wire through a magnetic field, that induces a voltage.

14
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:47,990
So that voltage comes out on that wire, and it's a continuous signal.

15
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:51,000
But, in order to encode this into a computer,

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,450
we put it through what's known as an A to D converter,

17
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:57,650
analog to digital converter, and we get out a bunch of samples.

18
00:00:57,650 --> 00:01:00,940
And then, by the way in the old days we used to put those samples on

19
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:02,710
something called a CD.

20
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:03,460
Compact disk.

21
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:06,460
You guys probably don't even buy those anymore.

22
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:08,420
If, if you do, you only buy them to rip them.

23
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:13,290
But, basically, it's a set of samples, it's in a file, whatever it is, okay?

24
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:15,270
When you go to play this thing,

25
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:19,680
okay, what you do is you put your CD into your ancient CD player.

26
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,450
It pulls out the samples, and then it goes through what's called a D to

27
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:26,270
A converter, digital to analog converter.

28
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:29,790
And then we take that continuous voltage and we put that out through a speaker.

29
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:32,810
Which by the way, is almost exactly the same as a microphone.

30
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:36,150
Right. It's a coil of wire, you pump electricity through it.

31
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:38,645
It generates a magnetic, varying magnetic field.

32
00:01:38,645 --> 00:01:41,520
There's a set of permanent magnets that causes the speaker to move,

33
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,010
with respect to those magnets.

34
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:45,630
And voila, out comes a continuous pressure wave.

35
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:51,700
So, let's talk about this sampling operation and then the reconstruction.

36
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:54,240
So, here we'll take as an example just a sign wave.

37
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:54,770
Okay.

38
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:57,930
So, I collect a bunch of samples.

39
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:01,600
If I collect a bunch of samples, then what am I going to do to reconstruct it?

40
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,850
Well, it might be enough to basically just connect the dots and

41
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:07,750
get back the next sine wave.

42
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:12,030
Alright, and so, as long as I had enough dots, that's easy enough to do.

43
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:14,030
So I have enough dots, I connect the dots.
