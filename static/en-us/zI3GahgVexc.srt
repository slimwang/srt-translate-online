1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,310
So what makes a good feature?

2
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:06,060
Again I'm showing you two different examples of the two friends we've

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:11,230
looked at throughout lecture so far, Einstein and Darwin.

4
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:13,590
So, one more important thing we have to look for

5
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:17,830
is that these features have to be repeatable and precise.

6
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:19,730
We need to be able to find them again and again.

7
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:23,140
So if I ran the same feature detector on this image.

8
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:25,380
Today or tomorrow, or every frame between it,

9
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:28,450
I should be able to get the same set of features for both of them.

10
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:33,780
And this has to be repeatable, even with geometric variations in image for

11
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:36,870
photometric ones, that is geometric if the image is warped or

12
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:39,640
deformed a little bit, I should be able to find these features.

13
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,940
And, also, if the lighting conditions are different.

14
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:46,290
So, this repeatable, precise depiction of features needs to

15
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:50,998
have invariability to both geometric and photometric variations of images.

16
00:00:50,998 --> 00:00:54,100
A hard task, but these are the kinds of things we need to look for.

17
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:55,710
Another measure we have to also account for

18
00:00:55,710 --> 00:01:00,010
is the need to salient that is very specific and also be matchable.

19
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:03,090
Again, we are partly building on the repeatable part.

20
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:07,500
They need to actually have characteristics that I can actually match them from

21
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,140
one image to the other.

22
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:11,030
Of course, if you look at these two images,

23
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:14,260
while there are lots of features here between both of them.

24
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:18,260
If you notice, the commonality of these two features is this pattern here.

25
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:20,250
They were taken next to each other.

26
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:22,670
These two characters were of course sitting next to each other.

27
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:24,970
And, again, we will look at this later.

28
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:26,210
Basically the, kind of,

29
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:30,480
the matchable pattern between these two images is this region and this region.

30
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:34,240
So in essence, for matching on saliency and matchability,

31
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:40,210
these need to be features that have distinctive description mathematically.

32
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:43,150
That makes a unique aspect of these features that I

33
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:45,120
can actually find in an image.

34
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:49,770
Another characteristic of good features is they should be compact and easy and

35
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:51,340
efficient to compute.

36
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:55,170
Compact as in I can't really imagine taking each and every pixel of

37
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:58,370
this image and saying, I'm going to just use each and every pixel.

38
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:02,980
I need to find a few specific points and neighborhoods that I

39
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:06,910
can actually now match across those two different images and

40
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:08,958
I need to be able to do this efficiently.

41
00:02:08,958 --> 00:02:11,380
Again, efficiency could be both computational, and

42
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:14,790
again, the number of features I want to find.

43
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:17,440
Another characteristic, locality.

44
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:22,940
Locality here means that each feature should have a small region of support,

45
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:28,070
which basically means that with each feature should just occupy a small part of

46
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:30,430
the image, not the entire image.

47
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:34,480
Which basically means that if I actually have small features like this here,

48
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,580
this here, I, I can match them much more reliably and

49
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:42,990
more importantly, these features would be robust to clutter and occlusion.

50
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:45,860
So again, if this was occluded, and there are some features behind it because of

51
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:47,860
various types of things, I would not be able to match them.

52
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:52,700
If, of course, I had taken the whole flower as a feature, I want to be able to

53
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:56,900
find smaller parts of this feature, which still allowed me to match to this.

54
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:01,310
And of course, even the fact, that if I had taken the whole flower as a feature,

55
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:03,830
it's of course occluded and therefore would not look good.

56
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:05,420
Or at least not match across images.
