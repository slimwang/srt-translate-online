00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Let me see if you understand what I just talked about by the following quiz.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Let's assume we have two scan lines of six pixels each.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
You get to observe the following that I've colorized:

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
two blacks followed by three reds by one black for the left image

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
and one black followed by four reds by one black for the right scan line.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Let us also assume the occlusion penalty is 5, and the bad match penalty is 20.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Can you mark the location to which you'd like to correspond

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
this specific red pixel over here in the right scan line

9
00:00:38,000 --> 99:59:59,999
by minimizing the total cost of occlusion and bad matches.
