1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,283
Okay. We've got our basic if statement, if n

2
00:00:03,283 --> 00:00:06,112
equals 1 in Python, we print the string n equals

3
00:00:06,112 --> 00:00:11,780
1. Else, n does not equal 1. Now notice anything

4
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:13,660
I put between these curly braces, this could be HTML,

5
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:16,059
this can be anything. This is just text. And

6
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:20,110
then finally, we finish this with end if. Notice there's

7
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:22,820
no space between end and if, that's all one word.

8
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:24,620
So when we go to our browser to run this,

9
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:27,860
and we reload the page, we see n does not

10
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:30,530
equal 1. Well that makes sense because we haven't specified n

11
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:33,010
in the URL. Now, I hope you're following along with

12
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:35,830
me, and let's go ahead and add n as a Get

13
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:39,370
parameter, and we'll make it equal to 1. Okay, so

14
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:41,870
we set n equals 1 in the URL here, and when

15
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:46,595
I hit Enter, hm, I expected this to say n equals

16
00:00:46,595 --> 00:00:50,600
1. I wonder what happened. Maybe you can figure it out.
