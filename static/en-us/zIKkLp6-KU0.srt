1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,590
All right. 
And here's the solution.

2
00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:06,220
To start off, let's look 
at our forecast fragment query.

3
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:08,480
Since it's a join between two tables,

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:12,240
it's really easy for us to add 
additional parameters to our query.

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,870
Now we make sure we keep 
the column indices consistent.

6
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:17,776
Now we've grabbed the latitude 
and longitude at the same time

7
00:00:17,776 --> 00:00:19,462
we're grabbing our weather entries.

8
00:00:19,462 --> 00:00:22,740
The next thing to do is to move 
the function open preferred location

9
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:24,640
in map over to forecast fragment.

10
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,230
Instead of using shared preferences 
to get these values, we can actually

11
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:30,870
get the cursor from the forecast adapter.

12
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:33,950
We can get our cursor moved 
to a reasonable position,

13
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:39,160
and then build our new string 
which is just latitude colon longitude.

14
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:41,340
We'll leave our comment where it was.

15
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:45,720
Finally, we just have to fix up 
a few things in the code and that's it.

16
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:48,483
Well, at least for the code. 
We still need to do some work

17
00:00:48,483 --> 00:00:49,366
in the XML.

18
00:00:49,366 --> 00:00:52,150
Let's move this R.ID.action map

19
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:54,850
now over to forecast fragment inside

20
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:57,360
of it on options item selected.

21
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,420
And now we've got 
to do some XML work.

22
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:03,260
Let's look at our main menu. 
We'll just pull this action map item out,

23
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:05,620
and we'll place it right 
into forecast fragment.

24
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:09,030
All right. 
One more thing to do while we're here.

25
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:10,960
One of the things Raito talked about

26
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,780
was wanting to get rid of 
the refresh menu item.

27
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:15,850
So, let's just comment it out.

28
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:19,510
When we remove that action refresh item, 
we should probably comment it out

29
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:22,170
from our source code too. 
After all, you never know

30
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:24,263
when you'll want to use that 
for debugging.

31
00:01:24,263 --> 00:01:27,036
So, there we have it, our final app.

32
00:01:27,036 --> 00:01:29,200
No longer having a refresh button.

33
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,510
With new exciting setting 
to turn off and on weather notifications.

34
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:36,180
Details are taken care of. 
I hope you've enjoyed building Sunshine.

35
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:39,080
There's still lots of things left 
to do in Sunshine.

36
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:42,390
For example, we could also add 
a lot more intelligent things

37
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:45,200
to its user interface. 
And of course, we could make it

38
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,300
a lot smarter about syncing data.

39
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:50,200
And I hope the practices 
you've learned building Sunshine

40
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,533
will help you in all 
of your future applications
