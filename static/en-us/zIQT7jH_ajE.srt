1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:04,460
Let's do some coding to get an idea
of what professor just explained.

2
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:07,260
Starting with defining our symbols list,

3
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:12,320
having symbols like SPY,
XOM, GOOG, and GLD.

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,710
We then move ahead to
build our dataframe

5
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:18,910
df just like we did in
couple of lessons before.

6
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:21,390
So df is our final dataframe.

7
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:24,210
Now let's start computing statistics.

8
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:26,090
First we compute mean.

9
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:29,240
We need mean of stock prices for
each symbol.

10
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:32,380
And dataframe.mean will do this for us.

11
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:35,740
As professor explained,
it computes mean for each column.

12
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:38,270
And our columns denote one stock each.

13
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:42,470
So we get mean for
all stocks in just one line of code.

14
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:48,040
So to compute the mean, we just called
the name of the data frame df.mean.

15
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,078
Let's check the output.

16
00:00:49,078 --> 00:00:55,530
Note how Pandas prints the mean for
each symbol properly labeled.

17
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:59,570
Also, here's the graph with all
the symbols and their data.

18
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:03,170
Similarly, we can compute median and
standard deviation.

19
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:04,590
Let's do it.

20
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:09,340
We compute the median of the data
frame by calling the median function.

21
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:12,430
Remember the difference between
the mean and the median.

22
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:15,140
Mean is the average of a set of values

23
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:19,200
that is the total sum
divided by number of values.

24
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,220
Whereas median refers to the value in
the middle when they are all sorted.

25
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:26,950
Now let's try standard deviation.

26
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:30,490
We compute the standard deviation
by calling the function std

27
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:31,920
over the data frame.

28
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,850
Let's check the output.

29
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:37,980
Mathematically, standard deviation
is the square root of variance.

30
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:42,770
But more intuitively, it is a measure
of deviation from central value.

31
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:45,070
Here, the central value is the mean.

32
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:48,000
A higher standard of
deviation like here for

33
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,540
Google indicates that the stock
prices has varied a lot over time.
