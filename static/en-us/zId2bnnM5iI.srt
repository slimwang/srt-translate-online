1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,137
Now, the only thing that we wanted to
change with this new equation was to plug

2
00:00:04,149 --> 00:00:08,531
in the symbols square and triangle for the
words that we had before. So, that means

3
00:00:08,543 --> 00:00:12,701
that we only want to change what's right
here and what's right here. That means

4
00:00:12,713 --> 00:00:16,887
that we can keep the numbers that are
already in the equation in the same

5
00:00:16,899 --> 00:00:22,004
places. So let's just go ahead and bubble
those in. Our substitution rule said that

6
00:00:22,016 --> 00:00:26,620
we can replace money Grant has left with a
square and number of months with a

7
00:00:26,632 --> 00:00:31,669
triangle, so let's bubble those in. Money
Grant has left comes first so that means

8
00:00:31,681 --> 00:00:37,715
that this square comes first And number of
months comes very last. So that means, the

9
00:00:37,727 --> 00:00:43,605
triangle, comes at the end. So now, our
equation reads, square = $3,000,000 -

10
00:00:43,617 --> 00:00:45,125
$100,000 times triangle.
