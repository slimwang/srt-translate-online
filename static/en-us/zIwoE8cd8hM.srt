00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The numerical approach is just about perfect to determine the heat capacity of the oceans.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
In particular, as we need tons of geographic data,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
the numerical approaches are not good to prove something about mathematics,

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
and particularly not when it comes to infinite numbers of operations,

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
and to determine whether a control system is unconditionally stable or not

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
is also not a great task for numerical approaches.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
We should first do some mathematics to get some general statements about that control system

8
00:00:29,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and then we can possibly use numerics on a very abstract level, for instance, to analyze matrices.
