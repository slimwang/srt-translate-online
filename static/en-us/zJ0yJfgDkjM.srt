00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,160
So in the last lecture we spent
time trying to learn about

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:04,510
image transformations.

3
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:07,290
We looked at how would we rotate,
translate, or

4
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:11,680
even do projective transformations on
images, and learn about image warping.

5
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:15,290
Now lets spend more time trying to
understand what happens when we do these

6
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:17,120
warps that are non-ridgid.

7
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:21,210
Specifically what I'd like to introduce
is the concept of image morphing.

8
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:24,400
That is how would we take one image
that we know some features in and

9
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,100
transform it and
morph it to look like another one.

10
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:29,910
This is a widely used technique
used in films a lot, and

11
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:32,910
actually is one of the stronger
techniques in competition photography,

12
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:35,530
something we'll be leveraging
a lot in future lessons.
