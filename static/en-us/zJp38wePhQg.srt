00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,220
Frameworks are incredibly powerful.

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:04,860
And an invaluable resource
when developing complex

3
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:06,970
interactive single page applications.

4
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:10,250
With all of the stuff that frameworks do
for us, I don't want you to forget that

5
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:13,690
these frameworks are primarily
made up of regular JavaScript.

6
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:16,960
In the next lesson, we'll be taking
a deep dive into the Backbone framework,

7
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,240
to see how it maintains features
like templating, event handling, and

8
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:20,870
state management.
