1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,700
So Charles and Michael just gave
you some of the general theory and

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:04,950
inspiration behind machine learning.

3
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:07,450
They also covered the three types of
machine learning that will make up a lot

4
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:11,270
of your work in this Nanodegree
program supervised, unsupervised, and

5
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:13,030
reinforcement learning.

6
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:15,770
Now let's cover some of the examples
of the applications of machine learning

7
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:17,320
a little bit more detail.

8
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:21,050
Like Sebastian self driving car or
health care or trading.

9
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:23,500
We've taken a few videos from some
other courses we've produced so

10
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:26,420
you can get an idea for
what machine learning can do.

11
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:29,010
Notice, especially how in every
case we can describe the problem

12
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:31,370
as learning concepts from raw data.

13
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:34,890
Learning concepts and building models
is the core of machine learning.

14
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:37,450
And every problem you tackle can
be described in these terms.
