1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:03,750
We can connect the subject's thinking
to several topics we have already

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:05,220
covered in this class.

3
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:07,470
You may recall that
early on in this course,

4
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:09,810
we used frames to understand
stories of this kind.

5
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:13,700
Now this story is actually capturing
some information about a system.

6
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:18,910
In this political system, there is
a country with people and a president.

7
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:22,610
It also had geological faults as
a result of which earthquakes occur

8
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:24,160
that killed some people.

9
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,510
So the components, the complex
relationships between these components,

10
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:31,540
the complex processes that emerge out of
this interaction between the components.

11
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:34,960
Scripts, too,
are related to system thinking.

12
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:39,240
Dining at a restaurant
is a complex system.

13
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:42,560
Once again, there are a number of
components, relationships, interactions,

14
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,390
processes, functions.

15
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:47,720
A script is a knowledge for presentation
that allows us to capture knowledge

16
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:50,910
of a stereotypical dining
experience at a restaurant.

17
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:52,440
When we discussed diagnosis,

18
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:56,060
at that time we talked about systems
thinking a little bit more explicitly.

19
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:59,980
To begin with, we said that diagnosis
is identification of a fault

20
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:02,520
responsible for a malfunctioning system.

21
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:06,100
Diagnosis begins with the observed
data about some system what are its

22
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:09,528
expectations of the behavior
expected of it.

23
00:01:09,528 --> 00:01:11,930
The diagnostic paths takes the data and

24
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:16,330
matches it to hypotheses of a fault
responsible for that behavior.

25
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:21,030
What makes a diagnostic task so hard,
again, is that there are a large number

26
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:24,970
of components that interact with each
other, and it is a complex behavior that

27
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:27,700
emerges out of the interaction
between these components.

28
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:29,070
Just think of program debugging.

29
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:32,920
Program debugging is hard because there
are a large number of lines in the code,

30
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:35,640
and these lines in the code
interact with each other, and very

31
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,720
complex behaviors, output behaviors,
emerge because of those interactions.

32
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:42,610
>> So another good example of how
diagnosis is a case of systems thinking

33
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:44,932
is if we look at ecological systems.

34
00:01:44,932 --> 00:01:48,840
Recently there's been a massive drop in
the population of bees around the world.

35
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:49,340
That's our data.

36
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:54,550
As it turns out, the cause for this drop
in bee population is the presence of

37
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:58,060
a poisonous substance in insecticides
used in the past several years.

38
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:02,800
However, we can't see the process of
bees getting poisoned by this chemical.

39
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:06,230
All we can do is infer it based on
higher level interactions of seeing

40
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:08,740
the bee populations drop and
seeing a rise in this chemical.

41
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:13,040
So, in this way, there's multiple
levels of abstraction in this process.

42
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,720
There's the visible bee population,

43
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,600
there's the visible use of pesticide,
but

44
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:20,330
there's also an invisible layer where
the pesticide actually poisons the bees.

45
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:22,760
So, we have to discern the interaction
between these multiple levels.

46
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:26,715
>> In any complex system there will
be many levels of abstraction,

47
00:02:26,715 --> 00:02:28,995
some invisible, some visible.

48
00:02:28,995 --> 00:02:33,325
The human eye, or human senses more
generally, can see only some of these

49
00:02:33,325 --> 00:02:36,245
levels of abstraction,
the visible levels of abstraction.

50
00:02:36,245 --> 00:02:39,765
System thinking helps us
understand the invisible levels.
