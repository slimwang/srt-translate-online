00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:03,219
That was fun.

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:05,620
I hope you enjoyed exploring
the boxes that you can build and

3
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:08,730
customize on the web, but
really you're just getting started.

4
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:12,510
In the next lesson, you'll learn how
you can take all these boxes and

5
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:13,990
lay them out on the page.

6
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:16,980
However, I think now's a good time for
some practice.

7
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:20,918
In the upcoming problem set, you'll
be challenged to read documentation,

8
00:00:20,918 --> 00:00:23,656
resize elements, and
use different semantic tags.

9
00:00:23,656 --> 00:00:26,211
You'll need to change their sizes by
playing with their box models too.

00:00:29,717 --> 00:00:32,130
>> Hey,
can you get your feet off the desk?

12
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:34,470
>> Good luck.
