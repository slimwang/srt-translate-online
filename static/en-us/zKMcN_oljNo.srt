[Evans] For this quiz your goal is to define a procedure, named sum_list,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
that takes as its input a list of numbers

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
and produces as its output the sum of all the elements in the input list.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
So here's an example.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
If we pass in the list containing the three numbers 1, 7, and 4,

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:23,000
the result of the call to sum_list should be 1 + 7 + 4, which is 12.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
See if you can define sum_list using the for-loop that we've just introduced.
