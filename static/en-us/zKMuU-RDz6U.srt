1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,610
So Dave has the same problem that Alice, Bob, and Carol also had.

2
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:08,119
If he uses a simple or a naive algorithm to solve shortest tour,

3
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:11,030
then this algorithm will not deliver an acceptable running time,

4
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:15,010
because what a simple algorithm would do to solve shortest tour is

5
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:19,560
that algorithm would simply try all possible orderings for the houses.

6
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,740
So, what I just asked you to fill out in the last quiz,

7
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:26,490
the computer would just go through all possibilities of saying

8
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:29,720
this is the first house to visit, this is the second house to visit,

9
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:32,720
and then go to the following house as the 3rd house, and so on.

10
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:35,860
So we have not even needed to go deep into the details

11
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:38,730
to see that this algorithm will quickly fail

12
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:41,400
once the number of houses grows,

13
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:46,270
because the number of possible orderings here will grow enormously with n

14
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:47,880
where n is the number of houses.

15
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:50,330
So, let's do a little quiz to make this more explicit.

16
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:53,260
So, what I would like you to tell me is

17
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:56,990
if we had 5 houses to visit, not counting the base we start from and get back to,

18
00:00:56,990 --> 00:01:00,260
but 5 houses where we can decide in which order to visit them,

19
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:03,380
how many ways are there to visit 5 houses,

20
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:06,700
and then how many different ways are there to visit 10 houses.

21
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:11,260
You are going to need a program or calculator for figuring out at least the second one;

22
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:13,010
the first one you can probably do in your head,

23
00:01:13,010 --> 99:59:59,999
but for this one you already need the computer to calculate the number.
