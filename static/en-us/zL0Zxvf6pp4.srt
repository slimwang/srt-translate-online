00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
We're looking at two different processes that counteract each other.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,000
The growth of the fish and the harvesting of the fish. Let's ignore harvesting for the moment.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
A simple assumption about the growth would be that the amount of fish increases year by year

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
by the same percentage similar to compound interest.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
To make things simple, we are measuring the amount of fish

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
as a number of tons not by counting.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Here is a quiz for you. Let's not include harvesting.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
What should the right of change of the amount of fish be: 0.5 per ton times the amount of fish

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:44,000
minus 4 * 10⁵ years per ton, or minus 0.5 per year times the amount of fish

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:51,000
plus 4 * 10⁵ tons per year, or plus 0.5 per year times the amount of fish

11
00:00:51,000 --> 99:59:59,999
minus 4 * 10⁵ tons per year.
