1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,610
So let me just show you some of
the results that you can get using that.

2
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:04,250
All right?

3
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:08,860
So here are again, this is taken
from the the Berkeley database.

4
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:13,070
And because Shi and Malik, Jianbo Shi
and Jitendra Malik did normalized cuts.

5
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:16,260
And you can see that there
are some pretty good results here.

6
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:19,730
You know, you like, I especially like
this one here where it breaks up

7
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:23,170
the picture of the people in,
in a particular way.

8
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:29,230
Now, of course, these, segmentation
is tremendously influenced by that

9
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:33,890
affinity matrix, and the affinity matrix
is defined by that distance function.

10
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:36,780
So, we're back to feature spaces again,
right?

11
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:39,860
We have to know what features we
should be computing a space over.

12
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:42,860
We may have to scale the features
because all of that determines

13
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:43,870
the distances.

14
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:45,930
But, once you do that and
you play with that,

15
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:49,410
you could end up with a really powerful,
segmentation method.

16
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:51,340
By the way,
you'll notice that there are more than,

17
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:53,530
two segments in these pictures.

18
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:54,690
Well, so how do you do that?

19
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:58,800
Well, the simplest is you partition
your graph, and then what do you do?

20
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,700
You partition again, partition again,
and you need a stopping criteria based

21
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:06,310
upon, sort of the affinities of the,
the links that you're cutting.

22
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:10,343
Here are some more examples also
taken from the Berkeley database for

23
00:01:10,343 --> 00:01:11,260
segmentation.
