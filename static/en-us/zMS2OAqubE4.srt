00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,480
Its actually quite straightforward
to make your apps content provider

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:05,840
available to third party apps.

3
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:11,445
The key is to modify the export flag
in the manifest entry here to true.

4
00:00:11,445 --> 00:00:14,931
As simple as that, any app that knows
the content URI can use the content

5
00:00:14,931 --> 00:00:17,850
resolver to access it,
the same way that you do.

6
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:21,480
Now depending on the sensitivity of
your data, you may want to protect it

7
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,020
by requiring specific permissions
to read or write to the database.

8
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:25,770
So if you want to,

9
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:29,340
you can effectively limit access only
to other apps you've created, or

10
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:33,530
to third party apps which know other
permissions and users agree to.

11
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:35,350
Then you just need to
publish this contract to

12
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:37,330
interact with the content provider.

13
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:39,870
Specifically the URI and column names.

14
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:44,020
And as simple as that, you've created
a new API just for your data.

15
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:47,810
This is exactly the same approach used
by many of the native content providers,

16
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:51,390
including the context database,
media store, calendar and call log.
