To reflect the function F of X in the Y axis, we need to replace X in the

2
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:10,550
original funtion with negative X. This gives us G of X equals log base 4 of

3
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:15,280
negative X. Note that we need parentheses around negative X to show that both

4
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:19,960
the negative sine and the x have the log operator applied to them. To shift f

5
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:25,820
of x three units to the left, we need to replace x with x plus 3. That gives us

6
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:30,910
h of x equals log base four of x plus 3. Once again, our parentheses are super

7
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:34,830
important here. Think about what would happen if they weren't there. That would

8
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:40,161
mean that the plus 3 was outside of the log part of the function. What would

9
00:00:40,161 --> 00:00:40,369
the graph look like then?
