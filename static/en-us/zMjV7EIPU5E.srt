00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:03,120
We'll be getting to our Sunshine
updates at the end of this lesson.

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:04,970
In the meantime, though,

3
00:00:04,969 --> 00:00:09,489
we're going to take a deep dive into
an app called Visualizer Preferences.

4
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:11,250
It's a little known fact that Larry,

5
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:14,410
our creative lead,
mixes beats in his free time.

6
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:17,121
Lately, him and
I did a collaboration of sorts.

7
00:00:17,121 --> 00:00:21,289
And, [LAUGH] no, it's not me singing,
I will spare you that.

8
00:00:21,289 --> 00:00:24,169
Instead, Larry wanted to
make a cool visualization

9
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:28,470
to go along with his demo tracks,
and thus, Visualize was born.

10
00:00:28,469 --> 00:00:32,789
Visualize shows an auto visualization
of one of Larry's songs, with a circle,

11
00:00:32,789 --> 00:00:33,640
square, and

12
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:37,200
triangle bumping to the different
frequencies of the sound of the music.

13
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,480
Now Larry loved this visualization, but
he wanted a way to be able to fiddle

14
00:00:41,479 --> 00:00:43,959
around with the parameters
of the visualization.

15
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:47,259
Things like the color, or
the size of the shapes, or,

16
00:00:47,259 --> 00:00:50,000
even, which of those shapes
appeared on the screen.

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,880
Now I have actually already written
all the code to be able to do that,

18
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:54,890
but there's no way for

19
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:59,020
Larry to be able to actually modify
these parameters in the app's UI.

20
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:00,520
This is where you come in.

21
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,020
You'll be making a settings screen for

22
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:06,085
this application that will let any
user modify the following attributes.

23
00:01:06,084 --> 00:01:10,704
First, which shapes are shown, second,
the color of the visualization, and

24
00:01:10,704 --> 00:01:12,905
finally, the size of the shapes.

25
00:01:12,905 --> 00:01:14,215
Let's go ahead and dive into the code.
