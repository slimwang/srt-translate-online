1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:05,200
The L stands for Linux, and that's the operating system on which

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:09,765
probably the server side of the application is going to run.

3
00:00:09,765 --> 00:00:15,130
Linux is a well controlled and uniformed operating system family,

4
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:18,280
and you can take advantage of that as a way of

5
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:22,030
controlling the variation that's going on in the system.

6
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:26,040
The A stands for Apache, and what's meant here is the Apache web server.

7
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:32,090
The Apache web server is the most popular web server, and using it and

8
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:38,510
its configuration file enables you to evolve in a controlled fashion.

9
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:41,860
The M stands for MySQL, which is now part of Oracle.

10
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:46,130
It's the database engine, it supports a standard relational type of

11
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:50,620
database access using the SQL language, so there's another standard.

12
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:53,740
And the P stands for PHP, which is a means of

13
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:57,820
essentially embedding the database interactions into your HTML program so

14
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:03,120
that on the server side, that can then become SQL transactions to the database.
