00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,719
When Mobile browers first came along the content on

2
00:00:02,719 --> 00:00:06,090
the Web wasn't designed for narrow small screen devices. It

3
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:09,700
was designed for Windows that were around 1,000 pixels wide

4
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:13,180
and wider than they were tall with easy scrolling. To

5
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:16,059
Shoehorn this content into a tiny Mobile screen since

6
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:19,890
rendering a Web Page designed for 1,000 pixels across and

7
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:22,200
a 320 pixel wide screen would mean you'd be scrolling

8
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:25,740
a lot. Mobile browsers basically lied about the Window width.

9
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:28,520
They made the Window act as if it were

10
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:33,230
980 pixels wide, even though the original iPhone was only

11
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:36,260
320 pixels across. This enabled sites that were designed for

12
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:40,460
a 1024 by 768 screen, that is, that were around

13
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:43,890
980 pixels wide to fit on the Mobile screen. Although

14
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:45,370
you needed to a do a lot of Zooming to

15
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:48,920
read the text sometimes. Unfortunately if your site did not

16
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:52,200
happen to match that 980 pixel width you were either

17
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,350
going to overflow or underflow the screen. Either wasting

18
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:58,370
space or forcing the User to Zoom. In order

19
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:01,640
to control this, Apple provided a viewport meta tag

20
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,690
to be added to your HTML to control the

21
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:06,830
default For how big should my screen act on

22
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:10,780
this page? The default is 980. So, if you

23
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:13,520
put 980 here, it would have no effect. The

24
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,430
Mobile browser already defaults to 980. But setting a viewport

25
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:19,500
tells the browser how wide the content is

26
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:22,170
intended to be, and then the browser scales

27
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:23,930
to make that size fit on the device's

28
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:26,660
screen. There are two ways to use this tag.
