1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,910
Let's now consider static power, which is what

2
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:05,990
prevents us from lowering the voltage too much.

3
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:10,380
Our transistors are really like electronic faucets. Water

4
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:13,500
comes here, and if the valve is open,

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:19,410
water will flow out. If the valve is closed, no water. But in a transistor it's

6
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:22,630
like this valve is controlled by water pressure

7
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:25,470
from another faucet. So if the power supply

8
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:28,770
voltage is dropped, there is less pressure when the

9
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:31,920
faucet is closed and as a result, because there is

10
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,845
water pressure here and the valve is not closed

11
00:00:34,845 --> 00:00:38,230
very well. There will be some leakage of water, because

12
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:41,300
the faucet is not totally closed. So, one component

13
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:44,530
of static power is this leakage. So the problem is

14
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:47,160
that, as we lower the voltage, this leakage goes

15
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:50,940
up. So we reduce dynamic power by lowering the voltage.

16
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:53,716
But that increases the static power. If we

17
00:00:53,716 --> 00:00:56,340
have already lowered this voltage by a lot, then

18
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:59,092
the pressure on this valve here is relatively wimpy

19
00:00:59,092 --> 00:01:03,040
already. If we still lower the voltage further, what's

20
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:05,624
going to happen is we're going to get a much

21
00:01:05,624 --> 00:01:09,250
larger stream of leakage here. So if we draw

22
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:13,010
the voltage on the horizontal axis and the power

23
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:16,206
on the vertical axis, what we get is when

24
00:01:16,206 --> 00:01:19,496
the voltage is very high our dynamic power

25
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:22,786
is also very high, but it drops quickly as

26
00:01:22,786 --> 00:01:25,990
we lower the voltage. So this is our

27
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:29,740
dynamic power. However, our leakage power is very low

28
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:32,360
when the voltage is high. And it grows

29
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:35,330
up very, very quickly because of the increase in

30
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:38,550
leakage as the voltage is dropped. So our total

31
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:41,600
power does something like this. There is a voltage

32
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,620
at which the overall power is lowest. If you

33
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:47,750
increase the voltage further, you're spending too much dynamic power,

34
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:49,890
so the overall power goes up and you're not

35
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:53,694
reducing the static power by much anymore. Whereas, if you

36
00:01:53,694 --> 00:01:56,400
go much further down from this voltage, then the

37
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:59,560
static power becomes very large. And you are no longer

38
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:02,670
reducing the dynamic power to compensate enough for it.

39
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:06,600
So this is why modern processors cannot just arbitrarily lower

40
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,870
the voltage to decrease the dynamic power. And also

41
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:12,060
why they are starting to have problems with static

42
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,280
power because we have already lowered voltage to the

43
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:17,970
point where the static power becomes an issue. Also

44
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:22,130
note that the leakage through the transistor like this

45
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:25,260
is not the only source of leakage that results

46
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:28,250
in static power consumption. Because the transistors are very

47
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:31,800
small they're acting as faucets who's valves are now

48
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:35,540
leaky too simply. Some water is coming through

49
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:38,700
here. Some of the water that is building up

50
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,930
the pressure is also leaking out and so on.

51
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:44,050
So there are multiple other sources for why the

52
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:48,070
static power exists. But to understand the relationship

53
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:51,486
between static and dynamic power, it's efficient to understand

54
00:02:51,486 --> 00:02:54,597
that, for example, for voltage, dynamic power and static

55
00:02:54,597 --> 00:02:57,037
power are trying to pull the voltage in opposite

56
00:02:57,037 --> 00:03:00,010
direction, and the optimum is somewhere in between.
