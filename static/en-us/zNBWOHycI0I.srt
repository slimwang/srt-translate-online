00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,030
Recognizing what's in an image is
the essence of computer vision.

2
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:06,200
When we look at the world
through our own eyes,

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:09,589
we're constantly performing
classification tasks with our brain.

4
00:00:09,589 --> 00:00:10,859
>> That's right.

5
00:00:10,859 --> 00:00:14,190
And in the case of self-driving cars,
reliable object detection and

6
00:00:14,191 --> 00:00:17,746
classification are essential to giving
the car to see the world just like we

7
00:00:17,746 --> 00:00:17,981
do.

8
00:00:17,981 --> 00:00:21,446
In this lesson, your goals to learn how
to identify vehicles and images but

9
00:00:21,446 --> 00:00:23,001
it doesn't end there.

10
00:00:23,001 --> 00:00:26,009
You'll need to come up with the methods
for separating false positives from

11
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:30,590
real detections and in track the real
detections from one frame to the next.

12
00:00:30,589 --> 00:00:32,368
So Arpan, where would you like to begin?

13
00:00:32,368 --> 00:00:34,640
>> Well,
like any good machine learning problem,

14
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,119
it all begins with feature extraction.

15
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:39,989
So, first we'll look at how
to compute features that

16
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:42,730
we can use to reliably
identify cars in our images.
