00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,190
Hidden columns essentially
hides columns based on

2
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:06,270
their importance as
the viewports size gets smaller.

3
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:09,570
Let's see how you might do this
with a baseball scoreboard.

4
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:12,090
As you can see all of the data is there.

5
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:14,690
The short name, the long name and

6
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:19,400
the runs scored during each of
the innings plus the final score.

7
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:23,740
I'm going to start small and ask myself
what's the most important information.

8
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:29,980
In this case, I'm going to go with
the short team name and the final score.

9
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:33,180
I'm going to use display none,
to hide everything else.

10
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:38,220
Then as the viewport size gets bigger,
let's swap out the full team name and

11
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:40,960
start showing each of
the runs per inning.

12
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,150
The biggest problem of hidden columns
is that you're hiding content

13
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:45,240
from the user.

14
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:49,370
What happens if I need to know how many
runs were scored in the 7th inning?

15
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:53,990
If I'm a device with a narrow viewport,
it's just not there, I can't see it.

16
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:55,860
So use this technique with caution.

17
00:00:55,860 --> 00:01:00,090
And if possible, use abbreviated data
instead of hiding it completely.
