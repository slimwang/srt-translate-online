1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,670
Let's take a look at the page's structure and

2
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:04,790
see if something needs to be changed.

3
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:08,900
In the instructor's notes you'll find a dom built from the design.

4
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:10,080
Check the link.

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,490
I'll go ahead and open it here by going and

6
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:15,270
opening the file because I have it saved to my local machine.

7
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:17,030
And we can see the design here.

8
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:20,050
It doesn't quite look like our orignal mock up.

9
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:22,020
Let's see if we can change it so it does.

10
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:24,210
I'll go ahead and open up the Developer Tools.

11
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:26,340
For that I'll press Command option i on my Mac.

12
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:29,070
There will be links in the instructors notes for

13
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:31,570
instructions on different operating systems.

14
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:34,340
Now that I've got my Developer Tools open.

15
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:35,480
Let's take a look.

16
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:38,240
First off, let's go a ahead and modify the header.

17
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,830
I will open up the div and

18
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:43,180
we can see that the header at the top of the screen is highlighted.

19
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:45,370
And let's go head and make some modifications.

20
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:47,010
Around the whole thing we need a row.

21
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:50,690
So, I'll right-click on this div and click add attribute.

22
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:54,120
I'll type in class equals row.

23
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:58,740
By adding row here you've changed the way this element on the page looks.

24
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:01,030
Inside of our row we needs some columns.

25
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:04,230
So I'll right-click on the first and click at attribute.

26
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:10,850
Here I'll type in class equals column medium 6,

27
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:15,660
indicating that we want the column here to take up half the page.

28
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:18,760
This is supposed to be the logo that's on the left side of the header.

29
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:19,970
I'll press enter and

30
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:24,300
we can see that now, this div only takes up half the screen.

31
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:25,468
Let's do the same for our name.

32
00:01:25,468 --> 00:01:28,820
I will right-click on the div and click Add Attribute.

33
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:30,600
And, once again,

34
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:34,860
we wanted to take up half the screen, so we'll type class equals column.

35
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:36,950
Medium six.

36
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:38,040
Press enter. And

37
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:42,860
now we can see our two divs are each taking up half of the header.

38
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:45,120
Now, I'd like you to go through the divs for

39
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:48,550
the rest of the page and add some classes.

40
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:51,200
Do your best to make this website look like the mockup.

41
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,710
But be warned, you might have some structural problems.

42
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:56,210
Make sure you've got all the right divs on the page.

43
00:01:56,210 --> 00:02:00,780
You might find you need to add some divs to this page in order to structure it

44
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:01,740
properly for Bootstrap.

45
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:08,190
What steps did you take to meet Bootstrap's requirements for the page structure?

46
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:11,730
Did you add a container div outside of your rows?

47
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:15,120
Did you add divs to organize your columns in to rows.

48
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,280
Or did you add columns inside rows to organize your content?

49
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:19,980
Check all that apply.
