00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:04,444
The solutions were negative 3 halves, and 1 6th. Nice work if you found both of

2
00:00:04,444 --> 00:00:09,130
these. You've really mastered factoring if you got these correct. If this gave

3
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:11,968
you some trouble, you definitely want to review your factoring techniques, and

4
00:00:11,968 --> 00:00:16,740
try solving some quadratic equations on your own. We start factoring by finding

5
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:22,796
the factor pair of negative 36 that sums to positive 16. Those two factors are

6
00:00:22,796 --> 00:00:27,142
negative 2 and 18. We use these as the coefficients of x to rewrite this middle

7
00:00:27,142 --> 00:00:32,960
term. Then we use factoring by grouping to get 2 x plus 3 times 6 x minus 1.

8
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,580
Next, we set each of these factors equal to 0. We solve each equation for x to

9
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:42,401
get x is equal to negative 3 halves, and x is equal to 1 6th. This is our

10
00:00:42,401 --> 00:00:43,490
solution set.
