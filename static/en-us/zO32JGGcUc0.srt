1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,060
So, wait.

2
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:06,200
Brute force, 2 to the power of N, and now we have a 3 in the base of the exponent?

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:08,700
Well, we probably need to do a little calculation here.

4
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:12,950
So what I would like you to tell me is what 3 to the power of N/2

5
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:15,140
can actually also be expressed as.

6
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:21,430
So 3 to the power of N/2 is a certain number to the power of N,

7
00:00:21,430 --> 99:59:59,999
and I would like you to enter this number with 3 digits after the decimal and please round it up.
