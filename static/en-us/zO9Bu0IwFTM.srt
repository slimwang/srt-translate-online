00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:04,850
Welcome to
the Android Basics Nanodegree.

2
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:07,610
My name is Chris and
I'm a curriculum lead here at Udacity.

3
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:10,820
>> And my name is Catherine and
I'm a developer advocate at Google.

4
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:14,306
>> There are over 1.4 billion
active Android devices today.

5
00:00:14,306 --> 00:00:17,070
So becoming ian Android developer
means being able to build software

6
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:20,300
that can reach and impact the lives
of tons of users around the world.

7
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:23,230
>> Yeah, this is a pretty incredible
time in history because mobile apps

8
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:25,870
are changing the way that we live and
work.

9
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:28,120
So we're super excited that
you're taking the first step

10
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:29,700
to becoming a developer.

11
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:32,500
For this Nanodegree, you don't
need any programming experience.

12
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:35,585
If you know how to use a computer and
a smartphone you're ready to go.

13
00:00:35,585 --> 00:00:36,486
>> Yeah, that's right.

14
00:00:36,486 --> 00:00:38,340
No programming experience needed.

15
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:40,386
So if you've ever had
an awesome idea for an app but

16
00:00:40,386 --> 00:00:43,590
didn't know how to get started,
then this is the program for you.

17
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:46,390
>> We'll walk you through how to
build several simple Android apps.

18
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:48,980
And along the way you'll learn
the Java programming language.

19
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:50,840
And also some key computer
science concepts.

20
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:53,280
>> Yeah, we're going to focus
on what's important and

21
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,460
how to directly apply what you've
learned to the apps you're building.

22
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:59,040
>> It's going to be challenging and
that's expected.

23
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,780
But that's why we're going to teach
you how to think like a developer.

24
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:04,325
We'll explain the decisions that
arise when building an app.

25
00:01:04,325 --> 00:01:08,552
You'll learn how to read documentation,
search for online resources,

26
00:01:08,552 --> 00:01:09,787
plan out your tests.

27
00:01:09,787 --> 00:01:11,643
And also figure out how to get unstuck.

28
00:01:11,643 --> 00:01:13,986
>> And signature to every
Nanodegree experience,

29
00:01:13,986 --> 00:01:16,970
you'll also have the opportunity
to complete projects on your own.

30
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:18,400
And get invaluable
feedback on your code.

31
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,003
>> And by the end of the program, you'll
have completed a whole portfolio of apps

32
00:01:22,003 --> 00:01:24,250
that you can share with your family and
friends.

33
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,413
>> We hope that you become
inspired to learn more and

34
00:01:26,413 --> 00:01:27,796
go on to build some great apps.

35
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:29,244
>> Yeah, let's go get started.

36
00:01:29,244 --> 00:01:29,820
>> Let's do it.

37
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:30,674
