1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The answer is all we need is this one word change.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
So far we're returning the first value we found, but if we print it,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
then we can see that and the loop will keep on going,

4
00:00:12,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and we can see all the possible Fs--the filled-in formulas that are valid solutions.
