00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,950
So, this quiz asks us to insert
the proper slicing indices for

2
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:06,220
the substring variable so

3
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:10,560
that the slicer turns the string that
contains everything after a noun.

4
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:13,850
So, this piece right here,
is what we want.

5
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:14,860
To solve this,

6
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:19,760
you need to find the first position
in sentence that starts after a noun.

7
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,440
Let's take a look at the sentence
variables index values.

8
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:27,650
The beginning of the string, or
index zero, has a value of A.

9
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:33,915
Index one is a blank space,
index two is N,

10
00:00:33,915 --> 00:00:40,180
index three is O Index four is u,

11
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:45,010
and index five is n, and
index six is a space.

12
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,510
Now we've found where noun ends.

13
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:51,360
Let's use this index as
the beginning of our slice.

14
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,180
Since you want to keep
everything after noun,

15
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:57,240
we can leave the right hand
side of the colon blank.

16
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,290
And there we have it.

17
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:01,960
Those are the indices used that will
give us everything after A noun.

18
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:05,140
As we see, string slicing allowed us
to keep the parts of the string that we

19
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:06,580
wanted to use and

20
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:10,360
let us cut out the parts,
like a noun that we didn't want to keep.

21
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:13,280
We'll see very soon how string
slicing will help us build a simple

22
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,210
mavericks generator.
