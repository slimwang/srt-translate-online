1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,340
Let's add a service worker
to the Wittr project and

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:04,750
start messing around
with these requests.

3
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:07,840
To make things easy the project
already contains a script file

4
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:11,500
at public > js > sw > index.js.

5
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:13,760
And it's currently empty.

6
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:15,219
So lets add a quick console log.

7
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:18,020
The build system picks this up and

8
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:22,540
the final result is served at
sw.js at the root of the server.

9
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:26,006
The extra code here is the output
of Babel which the script runs.

10
00:00:26,006 --> 00:00:28,850
Babel lets you use some of
the newer JavaScript features but

11
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:30,077
I'm going to stick with ES5.

12
00:00:30,077 --> 00:00:33,120
But if you feel like writing
newer JavaScript, go ahead.

13
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:37,800
As we talked about before,
the service worker receives events.

14
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,500
Lets add a listener for one of these.

15
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:40,950
Fetch.

16
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:44,060
When the user navigates to a page
within your service worker scope,

17
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:45,460
it controls it.

18
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:48,870
The network requests for its HTML,
goes to the service worker, and

19
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:50,820
triggers a Fetch event.

20
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:53,270
But not only that,
you also get a Fetch event for

21
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:55,330
every request triggered by that page.

22
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:58,030
CSS, JavaScript, images,
you get a Fetch event for

23
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:01,270
each, even if the requests
were another origin.

24
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:03,570
And we can inspect them with JavaScript.

25
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:08,530
So in my Fetch event,
I'm going to log event.request.

26
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:11,020
To find out what kind of
information is in that object,

27
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:12,240
click through to the next lesson.

28
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:16,370
That was me trying to build
up some dramatic tension.

29
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:20,612
I mean event.request it's clearly going
to be information about the request.

30
00:01:20,612 --> 00:01:22,932
Or is it.

31
00:01:22,932 --> 00:01:23,896
Yes.

32
00:01:23,896 --> 00:01:24,750
Yes it is.
