00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
[Narrator] Let's look at the grid world, again,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
and let me ask you a question.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
I wish to find an optimal policy

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
for all these states that

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
with maximum probability leads me to

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
the absorbing state plus 100,

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
and as I just discussed, I assume

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
there's 4 different actions,

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
north, south, west, and east

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
that succeed with probability 80% provided

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
that the corresponding grid cell is actually attainable.

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I wish to know what is the optimal action

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
in the corner set over here, A1,

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
and I give you 4 choices,

15
00:00:34,000 --> 99:59:59,999
north, south, west, and east.
