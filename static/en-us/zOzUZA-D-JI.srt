00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:05,621
I'll show you a nifty photot that needs math function to work. We want to take

2
00:00:05,621 --> 00:00:11,282
any old photo and make it appear as if it happened at sunset. And the idea is

3
00:00:11,282 --> 00:00:15,840
simple. We'll just add some extra red, like this. But there's a potential

4
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:22,346
problem. What if red is already 255 or close to it. Then if we ad 25 to it,

5
00:00:22,346 --> 00:00:28,972
then we'll get a value that's larger than 255 and that won't work. So I want

6
00:00:28,972 --> 00:00:35,764
red to be red plus 25 but at most 255. And one of the math functions that we've

7
00:00:35,764 --> 00:00:39,710
just seen will solve this for you. I'll even give you a hint. It's either

8
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:45,612
Math.max or Max.min. So go ahead and implement the redden method in the color

9
00:00:45,612 --> 00:00:48,470
class and then try out the effect.
