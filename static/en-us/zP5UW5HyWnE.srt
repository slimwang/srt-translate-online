00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:01,350
So, I want to show you one more

2
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:04,400
thing. Here, we have two loops. This one arranges

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,210
the pictures. The one over here draws the

4
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:11,310
pictures. Now, the second loop is so simple and

5
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:14,020
so common, that there is a shorthand for

6
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:17,920
it called the enhanced for loop. Instead of letting

7
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,700
the index value, i, go from zero, through

8
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:25,540
all the valid values. And then using the index,

9
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:27,950
to get the ith picture, you can do the

10
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:31,550
following. You can simply write for, then you make a

11
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:34,830
variable for the picture. Then you write a colon, and

12
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:38,260
then the array list that you want to traverse. This loop

13
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:41,290
sets pic to the first element in the gallery.

14
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:44,250
Or I guess I should say the zeroth element, then

15
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:47,506
to the element within index one, then to the element

16
00:00:47,506 --> 00:00:50,772
with index two, and so on. So pic assumes and

17
00:00:50,772 --> 00:00:56,700
turn all of the values off the array list each time the loop is entered

18
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:01,250
and in this case, pic is drawn. You could do other things as well, of course.
