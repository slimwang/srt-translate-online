1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,370
So let's see if we understand the types of partners and suppliers that are available

2
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:07,810
and remember, none of these come with a memo that says

3
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:09,670
they look exactly like these.

4
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:11,720
Some of these might actually blur the lines,

5
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:14,080
but let's take a look and see if we can understand

6
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:19,080
who would fit under strategic alliances, joint ventures,

7
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:25,020
traffic partners, coopetition, joint business development, and suppliers.

8
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:30,250
Match the type of relationship with each of these partnership examples.
