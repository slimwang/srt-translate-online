00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:02,969
Okay, in this lesson we will talk about spam

2
00:00:02,969 --> 00:00:06,650
or unwanted commercial email. Now, you might not think

3
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:08,400
that you receive a lot of spam but the

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,560
fact of the matter is that most of it goes

5
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:13,720
to your spam folder. So one might think what's

6
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:17,720
the problem? Well, in fact, spam remains a scourge for

7
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:21,180
network operators. In particular, someone has to design the

8
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:25,690
filters that separate the good traffic from the bad traffic.

9
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:28,280
Additionally, even if email is classified as spam,

10
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:31,400
if it's accepted for delivery, the internet's mail

11
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:34,190
protocols dictate that the server has to keep

12
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:36,690
the mail. Because it's told the receiver that it

13
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:39,350
has accepted the mail. This creates the potential

14
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:42,740
for spam to consume a significant amount of

15
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:46,330
storage space on email servers. Finally, spam can

16
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:50,700
create security problems for users who receive spam emails.

17
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:54,360
If the spam messages contain a payload that could

18
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:57,850
be harmful such as malware or a phishing attack,

19
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:01,270
or an attempt to steal a user's private or

20
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:04,170
sensitive information, such as a password. Now even though

21
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:06,830
you don't see the mail because of these filters,

22
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:10,760
something like 95% of all email traffic is spam.

23
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:13,510
Some reports from the Anti-phishing Working Group suggest that

24
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:17,160
something like one in 87 emails was a phishing

25
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:21,260
attack and there's something like 50,000 unique

26
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:24,460
phishing attacks in a month. A common approach

27
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:27,180
for getting rid of spam messages is to

28
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:30,720
filter. In other words, prevent the message from

29
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:35,520
reaching the user's inbox in the first place. Now this begs the question of how

30
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,870
to differentiate spam, or the bad messages, from

31
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:42,370
ham, or the legitimate messages. There are three

32
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:46,760
different ways to construct filters. One is content-based. In

33
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,820
other words, you can look at what's being said in

34
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:52,440
the mail. For example, if the mail contains particular words,

35
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:56,820
such as Viagra or Rolex, a content-based filter might pick

36
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:59,630
up on those terms and decide to filter the mail.

37
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:02,740
Second, a filter might make a decision about whether an

38
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:04,920
email message is spam or ham based on the IP

39
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:08,229
address of the sender. This method is often called blacklisting.

40
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:11,360
Third, we can construct filter based on behavioral features,

41
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,970
or how the mail is sent. So for example,

42
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:19,410
if the mail is sent at a particular time of day, or if it's sent in a batch of

43
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:22,420
emails that are all roughly the same size, then

44
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:25,150
we may be able to figure out that a message

45
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:28,840
is likely spam simply based on the sender's sending

46
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:33,654
behavior. Now each of these approaches are complementary, but content-based

47
00:02:33,654 --> 00:02:37,275
filtering and IP-based filtering each have problems.

48
00:02:37,275 --> 00:02:40,270
Content-based filters are relatively easy for attackers

49
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:44,820
to evade. A recent large commercial mail operator recently told me that he saw

50
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:48,620
something like 80,000 different spellings of Viagra.

51
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:51,840
But additionally, messages can be carried not

52
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,480
only in texts, but in images, Excel

53
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,760
spreadsheets, or even mp3s or movies. Therefore,

54
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:02,870
spammers can easily alter the features of an email's content and adjust those

55
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:08,940
features and change them to evade content based filters. On the flip side, those

56
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:11,530
maintaining the filters suffer a relatively high

57
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:13,860
cost because the filters must be continually

58
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,890
updated as content changes and the means

59
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:19,880
of carrying the content become more sophisticated.
