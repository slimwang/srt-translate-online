00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,110
So let's try this out on this page. Let's add a device with meta element to

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:06,360
our Lorem Ipsum page, and refresh it on

3
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:09,350
the mobile browser. This is what our page looked

4
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:12,610
like before. Now with the meta tag in

5
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:15,510
place. Let's try reloading it. And you can see,

6
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:17,690
the page now chooses a better size because

7
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:19,930
it's reflowing at the native size of the screen.
