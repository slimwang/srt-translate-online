Since the conference app doesn't use touch that much, we're

2
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:05,400
going to have you take a look at adding touch support

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:08,130
to a different example. Let's take a look at how we

4
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:13,270
would code a simple drawing application on a web page. First,

5
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:15,670
let's look at this, as we would write it for the

6
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:19,430
mouse. You can see where we've hooked the mouse down, mouse

7
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:22,660
move and mouse up events. And you can see are handlers

8
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:25,820
for each one of these simply creates a new stroke and

9
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:28,560
the adds points to that stroke as we go.

10
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,690
Now, we'd like you to change this code to use

11
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:34,610
pointer events. Don't forget to set the touch action attribute

12
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:37,269
on the HTML element that you're using as an event

13
00:00:37,269 --> 00:00:40,420
listener. We've already included the polymer polyfill, so you

14
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:42,990
don't need to worry about doing that. Just change the

15
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:45,980
event handlers to be pointer events and then make any

16
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:49,080
appropriate changes to the handlers themselves if there are any.
