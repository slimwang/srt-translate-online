00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,868
Next, we have disorganized speech, which is sometimes called word salad,

2
00:00:03,868 --> 00:00:09,184
because of the way the words are arranged. Meaning that the speech of a person

3
00:00:09,184 --> 00:00:12,824
with schizophrenia often involves grammatical rules, but the content makes

4
00:00:12,824 --> 00:00:17,963
little sense. Therefore, it's difficult or hard to understand what the person

5
00:00:17,963 --> 00:00:24,613
is saying. Their sentences make little sense. Also, topics of conversations can

6
00:00:24,613 --> 00:00:29,528
change with little or no connection between the sentences. And finally, speech

7
00:00:29,528 --> 00:00:34,226
may be completely incomprehensible. Let's give an example of what we mean by

8
00:00:34,226 --> 00:00:39,295
disorganized speech, or as we said, some people refer to as word salad. In the

9
00:00:39,295 --> 00:00:43,455
following example, a woman who believes she was the only female professor at

10
00:00:43,455 --> 00:00:47,810
the University of Smithsonian, in England, now mind you, there's no such place,

11
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:53,637
uses words to produce a word salad. So let's try to go through this. Take a

12
00:00:53,637 --> 00:00:57,420
moment and see if you can read it out loud clearly.
