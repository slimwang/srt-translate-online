00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:03,890
There are several advantages of
deploying host based firewalls.

2
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:07,920
For example, specific security policies
for service can be incremented

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:11,590
with different filters for
servers used for different applications.

4
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:15,280
Since the firewall is not at the network
parameter, both internal and

5
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:18,510
external attacks can be stopped
by the host based firewall.

6
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:21,270
That is, while an attack coming
from the internal network

7
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:23,910
is missed by the firewall
at the network perimeter,

8
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:26,800
it can be stopped by
the host based firewall.

9
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:31,310
We typically deploy host based firewall
in addition to network firewall, so

10
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:35,220
therefore, host based firewalls provides
an additional layer of protection.
