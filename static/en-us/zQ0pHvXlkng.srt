00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:04,558
Here are our final answers. Great work if you got those correct. This cube root

2
00:00:04,558 --> 00:00:07,418
and this 5th root might have been tricky, so if you struggled with them, that's

3
00:00:07,418 --> 00:00:12,541
okay. For the first one, we split 32 into 2 times 16. The square root of 16

4
00:00:12,541 --> 00:00:16,132
equals 4, and the square root of x squared is x, and the square root of y

5
00:00:16,132 --> 00:00:20,726
squared is y. This leaves us with a 2 in the radical, which gives us our final

6
00:00:20,726 --> 00:00:27,260
result. For the second one, we want to split up 75 into 3 times 25. The square

7
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:30,266
root of 25 equals 5, and then we leave the 3 inside of the square root since

8
00:00:30,266 --> 00:00:36,800
it's not a perfect square. Next, we use our idea of power divided by root. We

9
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,914
have a square root, so we want to take this power and divide it by 2, 3 divided

10
00:00:39,914 --> 00:00:45,140
by 2 equals 1 with a remainder of 1. So, one a will be on the outside, and one

11
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:50,100
a will be on the inside. For b, we'll have 8 divided by 2 which is 4, so e to

12
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:55,628
the 4. And finally, for c, we'll have c squared since c to the 4th divided by 2

13
00:00:55,628 --> 00:01:01,350
equals c squared. This is our final result. For the next problem, we rewrite a

14
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:06,160
as 2 cubed. We know that cube root of 2 cubed is just 2 since that this factor

15
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:10,610
appears three times. Now we us power divided by route to simplify each of these

16
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:16,955
variables. 5 divided by 3 is 1 remainder 2. For c, 4 divided by 3 equals 1

17
00:01:16,955 --> 00:01:21,870
remainder 1. And for d, we have 6 divided by 3 which equals d squared, and no

18
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:27,289
d's inside the radicals since the remainder is 0. And finally, for our last

19
00:01:27,289 --> 00:01:30,652
one, we can't take the 5th root of 36, since we don't have a factor that

20
00:01:30,652 --> 00:01:36,100
appears 5 times. Nothing simplifies. But for our variable factors, we can

21
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:40,734
simplify 10 divided by 5 equals 2. So, we'll have w squared, with no w's inside

22
00:01:40,734 --> 00:01:46,800
our radical, since the remainder is 0. For x, we'll have 6 divided by 5 which

23
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:51,654
equals 1 remained 1. And for y, we'll have 12 divided 5 which equals 2

24
00:01:51,654 --> 00:01:56,213
remainder 2. Here's our final answer.
