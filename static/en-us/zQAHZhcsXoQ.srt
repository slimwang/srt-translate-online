00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,080
Of course there's one more thing that I should always be doing when I'm

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:04,200
practicing machine learning.

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:08,480
And that we've neglected so far which is visualizing our results so

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,260
let me do that right now.

5
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:13,660
So what I do here, I make a scatter plot of all my data points and

6
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:15,225
then I also write a line like this.

7
00:00:15,225 --> 00:00:18,340
plt.plot is going to draw a line.

8
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:22,660
The x values of some of the points along the line will be the ages.

9
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:24,660
And the y values will be the predictions for

10
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:26,950
the ages that are given to me by the regression.

11
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:29,060
So these are kind of like the features and

12
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:32,750
the predictions and then this is just some formatting information.

13
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:35,340
Then I apply some labels and I show it.

14
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:37,520
And I use the show command to see it and

15
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,630
it gives me a picture that looks like this.

16
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:42,800
Where these are all the points that we had just like before, and

17
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,180
now I've overlayed them with this blue line.

18
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:48,170
And just by eye you can tell the regression isn't doing anything crazy.

19
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:52,380
Always a good sanity check is just to look at the results of your regression.

20
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:55,500
Especially if it's a one dimensional regression like this where you only have

21
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,820
one input variable, like the ages.

22
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:00,420
Then it's very straightforward to just look at it by eye and

23
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:01,360
see how things are going.
