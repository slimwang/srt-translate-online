1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:00,980
Alright, so what does this have to

2
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:03,170
do with function approximation or regression. So

3
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:06,850
how does this notion of regression of falling back toward the mean have to do

4
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:09,290
with this idea of approximating functions, mapping

5
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:12,120
inputs to outputs, it seems kind of odd.

6
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:13,970
So it turns out that the relationship

7
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:16,890
is, here's the, here's the connection between them.

8
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:21,460
I'm going to draw a graph and on this axis

9
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:26,550
will be the parent height. And on this axis

10
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:29,460
will be the average child height. So if we

11
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:32,470
plot these against each other, let's let me put

12
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:35,020
the mean up here. Let's say that this is

13
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:38,918
mean height for the population. And now say that

14
00:00:38,918 --> 00:00:40,770
you know pair, we sort of imagine that parents

15
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:45,210
of average height will have children of average height.

16
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:48,580
But parents that are really tall, like that

17
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:51,750
hypothetical person from before, will have children that

18
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:54,610
are taller than average but not as tall

19
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:59,470
as themselves. And similarly people that are very

20
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:02,640
let's say of smaller stature will have children

21
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,680
that are also you know short. And, but

22
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,500
not quite as short again closer to the

23
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,460
mean. And it turns out that you have this,

24
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:16,144
this very nice linear relationship between these quantities, and, there's an

25
00:01:16,144 --> 00:01:20,210
important aspect to this. Which is that the slope of this

26
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:23,520
line is less than one, it's two thirds. Right. If the

27
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,650
slope of this line was one, what would that mean Charles?

28
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:29,150
>> That would mean that everybody's children had

29
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:31,360
the, would, the same height of their parents.

30
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,770
>> Right, right, and so that's exactly right, and so

31
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:35,570
but if this slope is less than one, like it is,

32
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:39,920
it turns out to be in, in real populations. Then what's happening is the

33
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,490
children are little shorter than the parents.

34
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:43,786
Children of taller parents are shorter than they

35
00:01:43,786 --> 00:01:47,235
are. And the children of short parents are taller than they are. And that's the

36
00:01:47,235 --> 00:01:51,130
fact that this is less than one is what makes it regression to the mean.

37
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:57,692
Now this, this was worked out in I believe in

38
00:01:57,692 --> 00:02:00,464
the late 1800s and it was just such a beautiful

39
00:02:00,464 --> 00:02:04,320
way of connecting all these different quantities together. To kind of

40
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,570
think of them as being related in this functional way.

41
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:09,508
That people said, oh this is really great. I'm going to

42
00:02:09,508 --> 00:02:12,430
use this idea of regression. And what they started to

43
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:15,330
mean actually was this not this idea of regression to

44
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:20,410
the mean. But this idea of finding a, a mathematical

45
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:25,560
relationship based on a bunch of measurements of points. So this term ended up

46
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:30,600
getting misused. But that's the term that we have now. So regression now refers

47
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:36,470
to not this idea of collapsing back towards, towards the mean, but, the idea of

48
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:41,000
using functional form to approximate a bunch of data points. Isn't that weird.

49
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,360
>> That's pretty cool.

50
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:45,850
>> There's another example of this sort of idea where where a reasonable

51
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:49,250
word, like, like regression which we're referring to some physical thing

52
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:52,290
in the, in the world due to experiments like psych experiments at

53
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:55,270
this point became this mathematical concept where the name doesn't really

54
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:58,490
fit anymore, like there isn't really anything regressing in what we're doing.

55
00:02:58,490 --> 00:02:59,331
>> Mm-hm.

56
00:02:59,331 --> 00:03:00,910
>> There's another, really important example

57
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:01,750
that we're going to get to the later

58
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,540
in the course. Do you, do you know what I'm thinking of Charles?

59
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:04,300
>> No.

60
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:06,490
>> So reinforcement learning is my field

61
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:08,970
of study. And often your field of study.

62
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:09,640
>> Often.

63
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:10,890
>> Often.

64
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:15,380
And it turns out that reinforcement learning doesn't mean what

65
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:17,540
the words mean anymore. That this was a concept that

66
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:20,130
the psychologist used to explain what they were observing. And

67
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:24,580
then some mathematicians, well let's call them computer scientists, took

68
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:26,970
the word themselves, started to use it and used it

69
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:30,180
wrong, but now it stuck. [LAUGH] And regression is another

70
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:31,870
example like that. They, the word is sort of being

71
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:33,750
used wrong, but it stuck and that's what we're going to use.

72
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,950
>> This explains why every time I have a conversation

73
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:40,170
with a psychologist about reinforcement learning, we talk past each other.

74
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:43,850
>> Yes, they get very confused. I tried it to tell them upfront that's not

75
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:45,290
really what I mean, but I'm going to use

76
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:47,310
the words anyway, but it still confuses them.

77
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:47,810
>> Hmm.
