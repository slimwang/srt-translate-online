1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,594
So we're in great shape. We have an expression for x. But are we really done

2
00:00:04,594 --> 00:00:08,028
yet? I don't think so. We know that what we have over here is actually just

3
00:00:08,028 --> 00:00:12,680
equal to a number, but what number is it? Since we can't rewrite 121 off the

4
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:16,515
top of our heads, as a power of 4, we going to need to do a little bit of work

5
00:00:16,515 --> 00:00:22,788
here. What property of logs do you think we need to use to find out the value

6
00:00:22,788 --> 00:00:28,536
of log base 4 of 121? Should we use the product property, the quotient

7
00:00:28,536 --> 00:00:34,280
property, the power property, or the change of base property? Think about

8
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:38,099
what's keeping us right now from evaluating this side of our equation.
