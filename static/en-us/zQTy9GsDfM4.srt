1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:02,672
Oh, and
one more thing before we get started.

2
00:00:02,672 --> 00:00:06,820
I want to take a minute to acknowledge
that lesson two is a significant jump in

3
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:08,660
difficulty from lesson one.

4
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:11,140
We're really getting into
the thick of UI Kit now, and

5
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:12,880
learning some powerful skills.

6
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,350
So get your game face on,
don't forget to take breaks, and

7
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:18,230
make sure to reach out for
help if you get stuck.
