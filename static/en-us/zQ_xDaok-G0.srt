00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
[Thrun] And the answer for this one is really interesting.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
A is clearly not independent of E because through C we can see an influence of A to E.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Given B, that doesn't change.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
A still influences C, despite the fact we know B.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
However, if we know C, the influence is cut off.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
There is no way A can influence E if we know C.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
A is clearly independent of B.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
They are different entry variables. They have no incoming arcs.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
But here is the caveat.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Given C, A and B become dependent.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
So whereas initially A and B were independent,

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
if you give C, they become dependent.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
And the reason why they become dependent we've studied before.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
This is the explain away effect.

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
If you know, for example, C to be true,

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,000
then knowledge of A will substantially affect what we believe about B.

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
If there's 2 joint causes for C and we happen to know A is true,

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
we will discredit cause B.

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
If we happen to know A is false, we will increase our belief for the cause B.

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,000
That was an effect we studied extensively in the happiness example I gave you before.

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
The interesting thing here is we are facing a situation

22
00:01:19,000 --> 99:59:59,999
where knowledge of variable C renders previously independent variables dependent.
