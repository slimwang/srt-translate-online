IAN LAKE: Welcome to Android Development Patterns, where

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:04,460
we help you build better apps.

3
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:05,570
I'm Ian Lake.

4
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:07,510
Let's get to work.

5
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:10,930
Let's think about how you navigate through an app.

6
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:14,440
You navigate to a detailed view from the parent view,

7
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:17,470
or you can navigate between sibling views.

8
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:21,570
That's where tabs and ViewPagers come in.

9
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:23,900
So what is a ViewPager?

10
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:28,200
That's what controls the actual swiping between different pages

11
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:30,270
of content.

12
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:34,410
ViewPager gets its content from a PagerAdapter.

13
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:36,620
This could be a generic view-- one

14
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:39,880
for each page-- or whole fragments,

15
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:41,970
if you use a FragmentPagerAdapter

16
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:45,480
or FragmentStatePagerAdapter.

17
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:49,980
FragmentPagerAdapter keeps each fragment

18
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:51,130
it creates in memory, making it lightning fast to switch

19
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:53,480
between already loaded tabs.

20
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:56,180
However, this can get expensive, memory-wise,

21
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:59,330
if you have a large number of fragments.

22
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:01,760
Something FragmentStatePagerAdapter

23
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,910
solves by destroying and recreating fragments as needed,

24
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:09,220
only saving the state.

25
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:12,600
There isn't a lot to a PagerAdapter.

26
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,750
You'll need to override getCount to return

27
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:16,630
the number of pages you have.

28
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:19,720
Then, in the case of a FragmentPagerAdapter,

29
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:21,830
you'll need to implement getItem,

30
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:25,350
which returns the fragment associated with each position.

31
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:27,670
Here, we'll just do a simple switch statement,

32
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,810
selecting the right fragment for each position.

33
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:35,250
But you have the flexibility to use any approach you want.

34
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:38,210
The other thing we might want to override

35
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:41,830
is getPageTitle, returning a string describing each page.

36
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:43,970
Why would you want a page title?

37
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:46,810
Well, those page titles will be really helpful

38
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:50,620
if you want to have some tabs associated with your ViewPager.

39
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:52,840
Tabs give users a great way to see

40
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,810
exactly what those pages contain without having

41
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:58,230
to scroll through each one.

42
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:00,650
They also allow users to jump between pages

43
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:03,210
by tapping on a tab.

44
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:07,250
The TabLayout class, part of the Android Design Support Library,

45
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:10,530
makes it easy to implement tabs, with all the material design

46
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:11,520
styling.

47
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,740
And it's backward compatible to Android 2.1.

48
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:17,660
Let's hook everything together.

49
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:20,230
First, we need to hook our ViewPager up

50
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:23,890
to a PagerAdapter using setAdapter.

51
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:27,820
Then, hooking up a TabLayout is just a single method

52
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:29,850
setupWithViewPager.

53
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:34,920
With just that, you get tabs from the PagerAdapter's titles.

54
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:38,390
And swiping through pages will change the tabs,

55
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:43,480
and tapping on tabs will change the pages-- as you'd expect.

56
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:46,130
Get started with the TabLayout and ViewPagers

57
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:47,980
by adding the Design Library.

58
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:50,000
Be sure to check out the design guidelines

59
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,340
and the detailed training docs.

60
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:55,800
Thanks for joining me here on Android Development Patterns.

61
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,000
Use tabs and ViewPagers to build better apps.

62
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,950
