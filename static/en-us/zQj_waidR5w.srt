00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:02,710
If you're ready, let's go through the code to reshape our

2
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:06,590
data frame into a new one. First, let's install and load the

3
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:10,340
R reshape two package. Now, let's create a variable for a

4
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:13,300
new data frame that will be in wide format. I'll use the

5
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:15,950
same variable name for the data frame and just add wide

6
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:18,760
to the end. Now, we're going to make use of the dcast

7
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:22,310
function, which comes with the R shape two package. The letter d

8
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:25,760
is used since we want the result to be a data frame.

9
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,250
If we wanted an array or a matrix we could use a

10
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:31,890
cast. We specify the data set we are going to change and then

11
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:34,820
we put in a formula. So, here's the data frame I want to

12
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:38,960
modify and then this is where I'll enter my formula. Now, the first

13
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,200
part of the formula, or the part to the left of the Tilly

14
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,220
sign, will list the variables I want to keep with an addition side in

15
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:48,050
between them. Here I just want to keep h. On the right side

16
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:51,400
of the tilda, we use the gender variable since we want male and

17
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:54,430
female users to have their own columns for median friend count

18
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:58,180
in the data frame. And finally, we set value dot var equal

19
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:02,360
to median friend count because value dot var holds the key measurements

20
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:05,019
or their values in our new data frame. And it looks like

21
00:01:05,019 --> 00:01:07,900
that I forgot quotes around this variable. So let me add

22
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:11,210
that. Now, we should get a new data frame. And let's look

23
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:13,020
at some of these data frames, so that way, we can make

24
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:16,590
sure we understand this dcast function. Here are some of the rows

25
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:20,970
printed out and notice I have my age column, my female median friend count and

26
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:25,190
my male median friend count. See if you can recreate these steps on your own and

27
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:26,990
try playing around with the D cast and

28
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:29,640
Nill functions, and the reshape to package. The

29
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,430
Nill function will allow you to convert the

30
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:34,210
Y data back to the original long format
