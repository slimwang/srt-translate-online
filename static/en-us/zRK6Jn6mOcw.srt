1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,510
Now, you should have determined
that message is a global variable.

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:06,920
And you can tell this from looking at
where it's declared, which is up here.

3
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:11,000
It is not declared in
any of these methods.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,980
It's declared, in fact,
outside of any methods.

5
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:16,600
It is, though,
declared between the curly braces

6
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,200
of what we've been calling
the main activity class.

7
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,070
Okay.
So the next question is,

8
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:23,050
should message be a global variable.

9
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:28,430
Well, whenever we use message,we
see that we set what message is,

10
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:30,040
and then we immediately display it.

11
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:34,230
When we set what message is, we don't
look at a previous value of message.

12
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:38,140
Global variables are good for keeping
track of a previous value between

13
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:41,290
things like button clicks or
other events you might have in your app.

14
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:43,800
They're a way to save
the state of an app.

15
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:44,870
What they're not good for

16
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:48,370
is when you're using a variable
as a sort of intermediate value.

17
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:51,300
Remember, when you're executing
the code inside one of these

18
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:54,990
blocks called a method,
you do each statement sequentially.

19
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:59,187
If your variable is only needed within
the sequence of those statements then it

20
00:00:59,187 --> 00:01:01,293
doesn't need to be a global variable.

21
00:01:01,293 --> 00:01:02,959
It's being used locally.

22
00:01:02,959 --> 00:01:04,918
It's being used just in the method.

23
00:01:04,918 --> 00:01:06,320
And that's the case with message.

24
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,240
It's a kind of intermediate
value used just at that moment.

25
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:12,640
So, message should not
really be a global variable.

26
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,810
Now, will the program not work
because it's a global variable?

27
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:20,110
No, it'll work just fine, but let's
say I forgot to type this line here.

28
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:22,350
Okay, so if I click the No button.

29
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:25,770
What it's going to do is, well first
it's going to take healthLevel and

30
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:27,180
subtract one from it.

31
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:29,540
Now as a side note you might
be wondering what the value of

32
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:30,670
healthLevel is.

33
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:33,200
And well,
we'll talk about that in the next video.

34
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,230
But for now let's just assume it's zero.

35
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:37,070
So we take zero, we subtract one.

36
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:38,920
Their healthLevel is at negative one.

37
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:41,560
And well,
we don't have this line anymore, so

38
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,820
we just print out whatever message is.

39
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:45,280
Well, what is message?

40
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,530
When a global variable is created and

41
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:52,290
it isn't given an initial value,
it's given a default initial value.

42
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:55,760
For strings, the default initial
value is the empty string,

43
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:58,280
which is basically is a string
that has no text in it.

44
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,924
This would mean that the user doesn't
see anything when the no message

45
00:02:00,924 --> 00:02:01,920
clicked.

46
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,180
That's not great, but
not entirely unexpected behavior.

47
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:06,780
When things get really kind of funky,

48
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:09,520
is let's say that you hit
the Yes button first.

49
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,910
This will make it, you answered yes,
current healthLevel is one, and

50
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:14,620
show it on the screen here.

51
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:17,700
Let's say then after that,
you hit the No button.

52
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:21,530
It'll subtract one for the health level
making the health level zero again.

53
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:24,790
But it won't set message to
another value because let's say we

54
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:25,970
deleted this line.

55
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:28,940
So message will have
the old value from up here.

56
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:32,190
You answered yes,
current health level is one.

57
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:33,770
And it will display that again.

58
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:37,330
Again, this all happens because
healthLevel now exists between

59
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:38,540
multiple methods.

60
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:42,500
So whatever value was here before,
if we don't change it here,

61
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,890
we'll still be there.

62
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:46,340
And no sort of compile
error will be thrown.

63
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:49,930
Now if message was a local variable,
when you forget to set it to anything

64
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:53,140
here, it will complain and
actually not let you run your app.

65
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:55,800
But because you've made it a global
variable, it won't complain.

66
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,010
It will just print out what it had
before from the previous method.

67
00:02:59,010 --> 00:02:59,920
Which is wrong.

68
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,170
So to summarize,
message should not be a global variable.

69
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:03,700
Why?

70
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:06,370
Well it's not really
used in between methods.

71
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:09,150
Or it'll have some value
from another time that

72
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:11,410
the variable was used in another method.

73
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:14,780
Because a global variable will
have a default value set, or

74
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:18,650
it will have an old value from when it
was used in one of these other methods.

75
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:21,500
Now it's only if we make an error,
and we forget to set it to the correct

76
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:24,300
thing, but we shouldn't make our
job any harder for ourselves.

77
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,770
Okay, that's only one of
the variables in this example, so

78
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:28,153
let's look at the other one,
healthLevel.
