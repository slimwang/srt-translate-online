00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,961
It's easy in 3JS to hook up the mouse, keyboard, and other devices as

2
00:00:02,961 --> 00:00:07,660
interactive controls for objects in a scene. We've been doing this all along

3
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:11,292
with demos such as the robot arm. There's much JavaScript code to draw upon for

4
00:00:11,292 --> 00:00:15,630
getting inputs connected to programs, such as the dat.gui library for sliders.

5
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:18,204
However, up to this point we've had little direct interaction with our virtual

6
00:00:18,204 --> 00:00:22,192
worlds. By direct interaction I mean using the mouse to click on the world

7
00:00:22,192 --> 00:00:25,940
itself and change its appearance. The main direct interaction so far has been

8
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:29,614
using the mouse to move the camera. As an example of another direct interaction

9
00:00:29,614 --> 00:00:32,890
in this demo by Max Ogden and James Halliday I'm clicking to remove blocks or

10
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:37,520
add them. Programs can be seen limiting without these sorts of direct

11
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,634
interactions with what the user sees. Even when moving around the scene with

12
00:00:41,634 --> 00:00:44,280
the mouse, in many demos it says if we're a ghost, we can walk through walls or

13
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:48,374
drop through the floor, there's nothing stopping us. By instead performing

14
00:00:48,374 --> 00:00:51,318
what's called collision detection between objects, and having the program

15
00:00:51,318 --> 00:00:55,473
respond to those collisions, we can create a more believable world. We can also

16
00:00:55,473 --> 00:00:58,434
use physics to determine how our actions and the movements of other objects

17
00:00:58,434 --> 00:01:02,413
change what we see. If you've played any computer game, you know how various

18
00:01:02,413 --> 00:01:07,230
button pushes and so on are tightly tied to what you see on the screen. How the

19
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:09,550
world reacts to inputs such as these is often shown through animation

20
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:13,272
techniques of one sort of another. Up to this point, we've mostly been ignoring

21
00:01:13,272 --> 00:01:17,141
this fourth dimension, time. Once we start changing elements in our scene over

22
00:01:17,141 --> 00:01:20,683
time, we're performing animation. Animations can also be run in their own

23
00:01:20,683 --> 00:01:24,822
right. Streams flow down a hillside. People walk past you in a marketplace. The

24
00:01:24,822 --> 00:01:28,575
sun sets over ocean waves. Animation, such as shown in this demo by Daniel

25
00:01:28,575 --> 00:01:31,365
Heat, gives a scene life and a sense of engagement even when there's little

26
00:01:31,365 --> 00:01:35,670
interaction. What I'm going to cover in this unit is a sampling of interaction

27
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:38,850
and animation techniques. So let's get going.
