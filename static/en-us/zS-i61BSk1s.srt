1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:03,910
Alright. I want to make a lookup that relates bands and stages.

2
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:04,260
>> Right.

3
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:06,530
>> So I've got it. I'm ready to drop it. Do

4
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:08,270
I drop it on bands or stages, I always forget this?

5
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:08,270
>>

6
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:09,590
[LAUGH]

7
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:13,630
So, when creating any relationship, whether it's Master Detail or Lookup

8
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:17,200
you should always create the relationship field on the child record.

9
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:19,470
>> Right. Each band I want to know.

10
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:21,030
This is the stage you're pla-, playing in.

11
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:21,600
>> Exactly.

12
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,480
>> because each stage is going to have a bagillion bands.

13
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:23,980
>> Yup.

14
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:28,040
>> All right. Okay, make sense. Right. So, Field Label, I'll call it stage.

15
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:28,510
>> Stage.

16
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:30,410
>> It's just the stage the band is playing

17
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:34,150
in. And the fun step is that it's related to

18
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:39,750
Stages. Cool. And it already populated this stuff. So, I

19
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:45,560
save. Haha. We got our line. We got our relationship. That's pretty cool.
