1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,880
Now, I don't know about you, but every time I come across the halting problem,

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:08,510
I cannot buy the mathematical arguments, but I still feel some would cheat it.

3
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:14,780
It's important I think to realize what is being implied by undecidability and what is not being implied.

4
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:18,540
Informally, all that the undecidability of the halting problem says

5
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:24,960
is that you cannot analyze every aspect of computation using computation.

6
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,270
Let's say this program here is supposed to solve the halting problem.

7
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:31,170
This would be the program halt here.

8
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:37,120
The difficulty lies in the fact that all this required not only to be able to say what one given program

9
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,070
program two does, and of course, we'll assume there's also an input,

10
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:45,000
but basically, it's supposed to be able to say this for an infinite number of programs.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,910
Now, the following is by no means a scientific explanation,

12
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:50,050
but I think it's a good way to think about it.

13
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:55,110
If we have the requirement that halt must be able to look at every other problem here

14
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:57,810
then halt will also be part of this list.

15
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:00,180
So somewhere in that stack of programs, you will have halt.

16
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:05,019
Now, if you say halt must be more complex, and again, this is not a scientific explanation

17
00:01:05,019 --> 00:01:07,810
must be more complex that any program it's looking at,

18
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:10,990
well, then halt must be more complex than halt itself,

19
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:14,230
which of course is to an infinite cycle of complexity.

20
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:20,210
So here, we cannot have this spiral of infinity, which of course cannot be so there's the error right there,

21
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:23,410
and again, this is just an intuition a way which I like to think about it.

22
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:25,020
You may find other ways more convenient.

23
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:28,760
What I find is with undecidability and especially the halting problem

24
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:31,250
there is a lot of misunderstandings and pitfalls.

25
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:35,020
And actually, I would now like to go with you through one of the most common pitfalls

26
00:01:35,020 --> 99:59:59,999
regarding the halting problem and its undecidability.
