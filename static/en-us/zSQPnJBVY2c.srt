00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:08,090
substitution. Let's try and come up with one more method. Here's a system of two

00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:12,116
equations, and what I want you to do is I want you to add these two equations

4
00:00:12,116 --> 00:00:16,085
together. What would you get? You could write your answer in this box.
