You're given three points of a triangle. Given these three points, two vectors

2
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:08,440
are formed. What vector operation do you need to perform to compute the normal?

3
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:13,130
Is it the dot product, multiplication, inversion, transposition, subtraction or

4
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:18,176
cross product? Don't worry about the normal being normalized, I just want to

5
00:00:18,176 --> 00:00:21,010
know how you get the direction.
