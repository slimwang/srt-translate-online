00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:02,600
The last plot that we'll make for this course is called

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:05,330
a Heat Map. For our data set we want to display

3
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:08,790
each combination of gene and sample case, the difference in gene

4
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:13,290
expression and the sample from the base line. We want to display combinations

5
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:16,550
where a gene is over expressed in red. in combinations where

6
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:19,620
it is under expressed in blue. Here's the code to make that

7
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:22,610
Heat Map. First, we'll run all of this in order to

8
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:25,500
melt our data to a long format. And then we just run

9
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:29,090
our ggplot code using the geom, geom tile. Now,

10
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:31,530
this last line is going to give us a scale gradient.

11
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:33,710
And we're going to use the colors from blue to red.

12
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:36,450
So, let's see what the output looks like. And, there's

13
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:40,160
our Heat Map. Even with such a dense display, we

14
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,650
aren't looking at all the data. In particular, we're just

15
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:46,468
showing the first 200 genes. That's 200 genes of over

16
00:00:46,468 --> 00:00:50,350
6,000 of them. And since this data set was produced.

17
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:53,020
Genomic data sets of these kind, sometimes called

18
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:57,140
micro data are only getting larger, and more complex.

19
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:00,110
What's most interesting, is that other data sets also

20
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:03,030
look like this. For example, internet companies run lots

21
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:07,040
of randomized experiments. Where in the simplest versions, users

22
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,820
are randomly assigned to a treatment like a new

23
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:11,680
version of a website or some sort of new

24
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,370
feature or product or a control condition. Then the

25
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:17,810
difference in outcome between the treatment and control can

26
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:20,770
be computed for a number of metrics of interest.

27
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:22,990
In many situations, there might have been hundreds or

28
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:26,150
thousands of experiments and hundreds of metrics. This data

29
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:28,250
looks very similar to the genomic data in some

30
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:31,320
ways. And this is why the useful maxim plot

31
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,700
all the data might not always apply to a

32
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:35,840
data set as it did to most of this course.
