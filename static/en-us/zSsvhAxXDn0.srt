00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Let us now assume that P = 0.8, which means actions fail with probability 0.2.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Again, the cost is -4, and gamma equals 1.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I want you to run exactly one value calculation for the state in red up here.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Assuming that the value function is initialized with 0 everywhere,

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
what will be the value after a single value iteration for the state up here.

6
00:00:29,000 --> 99:59:59,999
This is the state a4.
