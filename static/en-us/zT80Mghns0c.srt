00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:01,000
In this session,

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,670
we're going to learn how to utilize
existing classes through inheritance.

3
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:08,740
Inheritance allows us to reuse or
inherit methods, properties, and other

4
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:12,830
characteristics from existing classes,
so that we don't repeat our selves.

5
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:16,010
This keeps the code we write clean and
maintainable.

6
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:16,630
Let's get started.
