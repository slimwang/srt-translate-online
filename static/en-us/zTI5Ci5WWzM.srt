1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:02,500
So let's see if we can get an intuition.

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:05,170
And the following examples are clearly contrived.

3
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:07,270
And there's usually no simple answer to it.

4
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:11,870
But bear with me and try to take the most obvious guess.

5
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:13,510
I'm going to ask you the question.

6
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:18,290
Which of the six datasets I'm drawing over here likely has some sort of

7
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:19,500
an outlier?

8
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,140
So I'm giving you six different diagrams.

9
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:24,620
And again, the answer is not obvious, but if you feel you'd call this

10
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:28,500
an outlier, check the box and see if you can guess the way we will assess it.
