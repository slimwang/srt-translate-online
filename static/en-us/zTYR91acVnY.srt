1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,260
The second statement is correct
because IP spoofing only works for

2
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:06,310
unidirectional communication.

3
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:10,760
For bidirectional communication, the
server will not reply to the attacker,

4
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:14,835
but to the spoofed IP address,
which will not respond appropriately.
