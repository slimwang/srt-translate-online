To finish up our last problem, we simply simplify the denominator. The cube

2
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:07,910
root of 3 cubed is 3, the cube root of x to the 9th is x cubed, and the cube

3
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:12,980
root of y to the 6 is y squared. Remember, the whole idea here was to

4
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:17,151
rationalize this denominator. We wanted a denominator that didn't contain a

5
00:00:17,151 --> 00:00:21,508
radical. So we multiplied by enough factors underneath of a cube root, in order

6
00:00:21,508 --> 00:00:25,750
to change our denominator to something that we could simplify. For our

7
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:29,215
numerator, we just had 1 time this cube root, and then we simplified the cube

8
00:00:29,215 --> 00:00:34,352
root, 3 squared is 9, and then I have my variables x squared y squared. We know

9
00:00:34,352 --> 00:00:36,914
we can't simplify this cube root of all, since all the factors only appear

10
00:00:36,914 --> 00:00:41,571
twice. And it's okay that we can't simplify the numerator, because our ultimate

11
00:00:41,571 --> 00:00:46,697
goal was to rationalize this denominator. We wanted to get rid of this radical

12
00:00:46,697 --> 00:00:48,383
symbol here.
