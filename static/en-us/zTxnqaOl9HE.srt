00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:05,689
I've already got my generator set up, and I imported java.util.Random. I know

2
00:00:05,689 --> 00:00:08,984
exactly how many times I want to generate a random number, so I'll use a for

3
00:00:08,984 --> 00:00:14,330
loop. I want it to generate 100 numbers, and I want to generate numbers between

4
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:20,914
one and six. If I use it this way, it'll give me numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

5
00:00:20,914 --> 00:00:24,576
So I have to add one. Now I have a die roll, but I don't just want to roll the

6
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:29,914
die 100 times, I want to count how many sixes there are. So if the value is

7
00:00:29,914 --> 00:00:33,391
six, I should increment the number of sixes, which means that I had to

8
00:00:33,391 --> 00:00:38,973
initialize it, and at the time I had seen zero so far. But I better not do that

9
00:00:38,973 --> 00:00:43,555
inside the loop because then I would reset it every time. Now after the loop

10
00:00:43,555 --> 00:00:48,678
completes, I'll print out the number of sixes. If you run this you should get

11
00:00:48,678 --> 00:00:49,781
17.
