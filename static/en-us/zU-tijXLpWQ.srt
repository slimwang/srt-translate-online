1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,900
So to quickly summarize.

2
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:05,900
I introduced a concept of how we can actually use cuts where we

3
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:10,240
find the seams to allow us to blend images or merge images that does

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,750
not require us to do blending or fading between two pixels.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,330
Basically, the concept of seam is very valuable as it can be used to kind of

6
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:21,330
generate original images or new images that actually use all of

7
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:25,230
the original pixels from the source and target images.

8
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:28,070
And we looked at various advantages of each one of the methods.

9
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:29,610
Both of them are powerful methods and

10
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:32,570
should be used, again, depending on what you want to accomplish.

11
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:36,240
The effects of ghosting and blurring are much more popular with blending.

12
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:38,930
Less so with any kind of seam calculations,

13
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:43,076
because you're actually giving you the same exact pixels from both views.

14
00:00:43,076 --> 00:00:46,240
As we get into more advanced topics, I will get in the habit of also show,

15
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:48,480
sharing with you a variety of papers.

16
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,420
Here's a list of papers that I talked about a little bit.

17
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:52,820
Again, they will be made available off the course website for

18
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:54,120
you to look at too.

19
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:57,200
And what I'm going to do next is, I'm going to get into the whole topic of

20
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,860
detecting and finding features in images,

21
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:03,350
because those are the ones that'll actually allow us to do more advanced things.

22
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:06,070
And here are just some cri, you know, sources that I've been picking up

23
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:09,580
information from for a variety of the topics I've discussed so far.
