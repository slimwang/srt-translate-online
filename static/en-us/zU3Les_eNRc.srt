1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:03,553
So here you can see my
button_custom.xml file.

2
00:00:03,553 --> 00:00:05,980
Now you'll notice I put
it in res drawable and

3
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:07,920
I just called it button_custom.xml file.

4
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:10,100
On it I have my selector,

5
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:13,130
and my selector uses
the Standroid Android naming scheme.

6
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:17,830
And within my selector,
I then have four items.

7
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:22,180
These items are for signin_pressed
where state_pressed is true,

8
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:27,430
signin_focus drawable when stay_focused
is true, signin_disabled drawable

9
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:32,810
when enabled is false, and then just
the normal drawable for everything else.

10
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:36,870
It's good practice to put your normal
drawable at the bottom of the list.

11
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:41,059
So remember state_pressed is true, will
give you your signin_pressed graphic,

12
00:00:41,059 --> 00:00:44,630
state_focused is true,
will give you your signin_focus.

13
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:47,310
The slightly different one
is when it's disabled and

14
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:49,430
you want that ghosted image
that we saw earlier on.

15
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:52,140
And that's where
state_enabled equals false,

16
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,600
there's no state_disabled equals true.

17
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,590
Just watch out for that one.

18
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:59,070
And then of course like I said,
your normal one is last.

19
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:02,510
Now let's take a look at how that
changes my button definition

20
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:03,730
within my main activity.

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,460
So here's my activity main layout,
and you can see the button here.

22
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:13,300
First of all notice that I've just
change my button from being the sign in

23
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:16,420
button to just a standard button.

24
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:20,698
So then the standard button,
if you look at the background setting,

25
00:01:20,698 --> 00:01:23,650
I've set it to drawable/button_custom,
so

26
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:27,291
that's telling the system
to use button_custom.xml.

27
00:01:27,291 --> 00:01:29,841
If you have named your
xml file something else,

28
00:01:29,841 --> 00:01:33,260
just make sure that you
use the drawable here.

29
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:35,190
I've also made a couple
of other changes.

30
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:40,460
Buttons in Android always default so
that their text is all in capitals.

31
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:43,650
But we wanted to have a sign
in with capital S, capital I.

32
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:46,960
So I change it so
that text all caps is false and

33
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,290
then my Android text sign
in will work properly.

34
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:51,260
I get capital S, capital I.

35
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:54,500
You could also take that text and
load it into a string resource, but

36
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:57,950
I've just hardcoded it here,
just for brevity.

37
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:00,760
You can also take that string and
load it into a string resource, but

38
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,950
I've just left it in here, for brevity.

39
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:06,120
Finally, because we've changed
our sign in button to a button so

40
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:09,550
that we can customize it, we have to
refactor our a code a little bit.

41
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:12,450
So let's go and take a look at
the changes on the main activity.

42
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:13,510
It's pretty straight forward.

43
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:16,750
Earlier I had a sign in button
called M sign in button.

44
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:19,050
I'm just changing that to be a button.

45
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:23,440
Then when I'm creating the click
handler, I just cast the fine view by ID

46
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,640
sign in button to a button
instead of a sign in button, and

47
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,280
then nothing else changes.

48
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:31,550
Let's take a look at what the app would
look like now with a nice Google sign-in

49
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:35,540
button, instead of the red branded
button that you saw earlier.

50
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:36,890
And here, you can see the same app.

51
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:38,370
I've just laid out
the buttons differently,

52
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:41,030
I laid them out vertically
instead of horizontally.

53
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:44,000
But, now you can see I have this
Sign In button instead of the red

54
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,790
Google Plus Sign In button.

55
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:47,865
And when I touch that,
I Sign In as before.

56
00:02:47,865 --> 00:02:51,280
As you can see I'm signed into my
app and I still have to sign out and

57
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,640
revoke access button similar
to what we had earlier on.

58
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,850
So that's just what the new customized
Sign In button looks like and

59
00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:00,350
that's more in line with
the web sign in etc.

60
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:01,240
etc.
And it adheres

61
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,820
to the sign in guidelines that
we saw in the earlier videos.
