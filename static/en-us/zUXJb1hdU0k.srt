1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,570
Okay Michael so you, let's make certain that

2
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:05,120
you really grasp this concept of weak learning okay?

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:05,883
>> Mm-hm.

4
00:00:05,883 --> 00:00:09,200
>> So, here's a little quiz that I put together to test your knowledge.

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,170
So, here's the, here's the deal. I've got a little matrix here, it's a

6
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:16,960
little table, and across the top. Are

7
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,610
three different hypotheses. So, hypothesis one, hypothesis

8
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:22,170
two, and hypothesis three. So your entire

9
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:25,560
hypothesis base consists only of these three hypothesis,

10
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,110
hypotheses. Got it?

11
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:27,580
>> Got it.

12
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:33,100
>> Okay, your entire instance space consists entirely of

13
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:37,160
only four examples; X1, X2, X3, and X4. Got it?

14
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:37,520
>> Got it.

15
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:44,810
>> I have an X in a square, if that particular hypothesis does not get the

16
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:48,410
correct label for that particular instance, and I

17
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:50,870
have a green check mark if that particular

18
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:54,290
hypothesis does in fact get the right label for that

19
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:59,420
example. So, in this case hypothesis one gets examples 2, 3,

20
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:03,100
and 4 correct. But gets example one wrong, while hypothesis

21
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:06,160
three gets one in four correct, but two and three incorrect.

22
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:09,320
>> I see. So, there's no hypothesis that gets everything right.

23
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,050
>> Right.

24
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:12,010
>> So does that mean that we don't have a weak

25
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:16,120
learner, because then there's some distributions for which any given hypothesis

26
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,210
is going to get things wrong.

27
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:21,340
>> Maybe. Maybe not. Let's see. Here's what I want you to do. I want

28
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:24,340
you to come up with the distribution over

29
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:27,470
the 4 different examples, such that a learning

30
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:29,850
algorithm that has to choose between one of

31
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:32,280
those 3 hypotheses will in fact be able

32
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,550
to find that does better than chance. That

33
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:37,860
is, has an expected error greater than half.

34
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:41,170
>> Okay. Then if you can do that, I want

35
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:44,770
you to see if you can find a distribution which might not exist,

36
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:47,210
such that if you have that distribution

37
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:49,360
over the four examples, a learning algorithm

38
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,380
that only looked at h1, h2 and h3 would not be

39
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:57,349
able to return one of them that has an expected error greater than half.

40
00:01:57,349 --> 00:02:02,020
>> So greater than half in this case would mean three out of four, correct?

41
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:04,190
Oh no, no. Oh, you're using, you want to

42
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:06,210
use that definition that you, that actually took

43
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:07,670
into consideration the distribution.

44
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:10,960
>> Exactly. That's the whole point. If you, if you always need to

45
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,000
have some distribution over your examples to

46
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,475
really know what your expected error is.

47
00:02:14,475 --> 00:02:17,320
>> Alright. And if there is no such evil distribution, should I just fill in

48
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:21,480
zeroes in all those boxes? Yes, all zeros means no such distribution. You can do

49
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:24,480
it in either case. So if you put in all zeros you're saying no such

50
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,700
distribution exists. But otherwise it should add

51
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,260
up to one down each of the columns.

52
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:30,470
>> It had better add up to one.

53
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:31,250
>> Alright, I think I

54
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:33,830
can give that a shot. Okay, go.
