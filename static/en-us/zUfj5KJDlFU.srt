1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,440
Let's try a few more of these P vs. NP questions.

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:07,400
And again, I'd like you to check whichever boxes you think correspond to true statements.

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:15,530
The first one is--If P≠NP, then all problems solvable in polynomial time

4
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:18,740
on a nondeterministic RAM will require exponential time

5
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:20,780
on a deterministic RAM.

6
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:21,870
The second one is--

7
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:25,070
If a problem requires exponential time to solve on a deterministic RAM,

8
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:28,710
then a nondeterministic RAM can solve it in polynomial time.

9
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:30,380
The final statement is--

10
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:35,010
Showing P≠NP would mean that all NP-complete problems

11
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:37,690
effectively become solvable in practice.

12
00:00:37,690 --> 99:59:59,999
So, check whichever ones you feel are true statements.
