00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,465
Now that we've seen solving a system of equations using substitution and

2
00:00:04,465 --> 00:00:08,626
elimination, let's see how we can use those skills to solve some more

3
00:00:08,626 --> 00:00:13,478
interesting problems. Let's try one with interest. You invest $10,000 in two

4
00:00:13,478 --> 00:00:18,122
funds, one of the funds pays at 7.5% and another fund pays at 8%. You earned a

5
00:00:18,122 --> 00:00:23,217
total interest of $787.50. So, how much money did you invest at each rate? Maybe

6
00:00:23,217 --> 00:00:27,257
you lost your tax forms or maybe you don't have your bank statements. Either

7
00:00:27,257 --> 00:00:31,353
way, you can use algebra to help figure out how much money you invested in your

8
00:00:31,353 --> 00:00:35,681
trade. When creating a system of equations, we know that we need two variables,

9
00:00:35,681 --> 00:00:39,826
x and y. This question actually indicates what variables we should use. We're

10
00:00:39,826 --> 00:00:44,351
looking for how much money was invested at 7.5% and at 8%. So that's going to be

11
00:00:44,351 --> 00:00:48,800
our two variables. I'm going to go ahead and let x be the amount we invested at

12
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:53,124
7.5% and y be the amount we invested at 8%. Using these two variables, what

13
00:00:53,124 --> 00:00:57,637
equation could you write involving the amount of money you invested? You want to

14
00:00:57,637 --> 00:01:01,734
use an amount plus the amount should equal your total amount. Write that

15
00:01:01,734 --> 00:01:06,749
equation here. And remember, it should involve x and y.
