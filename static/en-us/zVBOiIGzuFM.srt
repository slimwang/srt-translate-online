00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,200
Now before we move on to the combined approach with Greg, let's do a quick

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:08,293
recap of the psychological therapies. Let's first start with psychodynamic

3
00:00:08,293 --> 00:00:12,870
therapy. The goal of psychodynamic therapy is to uncover the repressed or

4
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:17,855
unconscious thoughts, feelings, and motives one has. The techniques of

5
00:00:17,855 --> 00:00:21,275
psychodynamic therapy are things like dream interpretation, and free

6
00:00:21,275 --> 00:00:26,576
association. Now let's move on to humanistic therapies. The goal of humanistic

7
00:00:26,576 --> 00:00:32,322
therapy is to create conditions for optimal personal growth. The techniques for

8
00:00:32,322 --> 00:00:37,360
humanistic therapy are unconditional positive regard, and empathic listening.

9
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:42,244
The goal of behavioral therapy is to change reinforcers and rewards, to change

10
00:00:42,244 --> 00:00:47,754
maladaptive behavior. The techniques include classical and operate

11
00:00:47,754 --> 00:00:53,581
conditioning, token economies, and systematic desensitization. The goal of

12
00:00:53,581 --> 00:00:59,000
cognitive therapy is to change emotions or irrational thoughts. The technique

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,550
used in cognitive therapy is critical questioning, and challenge a person's

14
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:08,500
thoughts with logic. The goal of cognitive behavioral therapy is to change

15
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:13,700
behavior and thoughts. The technique used in cognitive behavioral therapy is to

16
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:18,460
restructure thoughts, and use incentives for acquiring more adaptive thoughts

17
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:24,424
and behaviors. There's also the use of appraisal. The goal of group therapy is

18
00:01:24,424 --> 00:01:28,572
to create a support group in a community to show the person that he or she is

19
00:01:28,572 --> 00:01:34,374
not alone. The technique for group therapy is something like a support group or

20
00:01:34,374 --> 00:01:39,244
a 12-step program. Now that we've done a brief overview of the psychological

21
00:01:39,244 --> 00:01:42,530
therapies, let's go on to Greg for our final section, which is the combined

22
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:44,369
approach.
