What's going on, Gabrielle?

3
00:00:08,041 --> 00:00:10,167
It doesn't look too good,
I'm not going to lie.

>> I'm pretty bored,

5
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:15,260
this Xcode download is taking forever.

6
00:00:15,259 --> 00:00:17,670
I wish it would hurry up so
I can start building something.

7
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:22,160
>> You know, the last time I downloaded
Xcode I think it took maybe an hour,

8
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,559
two, three, I don't know,
it wasn't that bad though.

00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:25,669
While I was waiting for

10
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:28,380
it to finish downloading I spent
some time looking on the forums.

11
00:00:28,379 --> 00:00:29,769
I saw what students were saying,

12
00:00:29,769 --> 00:00:33,060
what some of our mentors were saying,
learned a couple things.

13
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:35,210
Before I knew it
the download was finished.

14
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:38,042
>> Yeah, you're right,
I should totally check out the forums.
