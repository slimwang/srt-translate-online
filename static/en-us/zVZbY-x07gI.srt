00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:05,380
So, imagine that you were a programmer implementing the internal logic of

2
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:09,750
the clock radio. You would have to take into account all of the different

3
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:14,750
events, okay? And all of the possible combinations of those events.

4
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:19,360
So, ultimately, you have to deal with all those cases. And consequently,

5
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:23,410
it makes sense during the analysis phase, to list them all, okay?

6
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:27,180
To give a fairly precise description of what are all the different events.

7
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:30,015
What information comes in along you know,

8
00:00:30,015 --> 00:00:33,700
its parameters to those events. And ultimately then, what the system,

9
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:38,020
how the system's going to respond to those events. And for the purposes of this

10
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:43,320
exercise, I've expressed that in a table in which we have numbered events, and

11
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:47,930
we have the the description of the event, and then the systems response to

12
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:51,210
that event. So, listed here at the beginning of that table
