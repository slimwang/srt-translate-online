00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:03,000
So how can we use what we've just learned? Well let's say that we have a

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,486
polynomial like this one that's pretty tough to factor. Here we have y equals x

3
00:00:07,486 --> 00:00:12,750
cubed minus 4 x squared plus x plus 6. And I'll say It again. I think this is

4
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:16,657
really hard to factor. So how can we guess what the zeros might be? Remember

5
00:00:16,657 --> 00:00:20,446
that's going to tell us what our factors are. Well, we know that the constant

6
00:00:20,446 --> 00:00:25,588
terms in the factors need to multiply to equal 6. So, what then are all the

7
00:00:25,588 --> 00:00:30,180
factors of 6? Please separate your answers by commas and don't forget the

8
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:34,299
negatives. They're perfectly valid factors, too, as long as they're integers.
