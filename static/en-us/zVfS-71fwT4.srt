Let's review some problems that
front-end developers work on.

00:00:03,719 --> 00:00:07,830
This popular new site is often where
I go to read the daily headlines.

00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:11,880
But if I need to shrink the screen size,
I can't see all the content.

00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:14,110
How can front-end developers
solve this problem?

5
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:19,260
Should they use responsive
design in HTML and CSS?

6
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:22,380
Or can they work with designers to
create mockups for the website?

7
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:27,440
Or should they focus on organizing
their code to optimize their website

8
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:28,970
loading speeds?

9
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:31,760
Or should they think about
storing data in a database?
