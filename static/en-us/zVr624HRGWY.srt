1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:05,470
So we can technically use the mean integrated square error or

2
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:11,320
AMISE to select the optimal bandwidth for a kernel density estimation.

3
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:16,210
However, for general kernels, this is very difficult to estimate.

4
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:20,960
So the first rule of thumb is given by Silverman's Rule of Thumb.

5
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,840
This works only for one dimensional data.

6
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:29,890
The optimal bandwidth is given by H, which is four times sigma raised to

7
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:35,560
the power of five, divided by 3n, the entire thing to the one fifth power.

8
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:41,930
In this case sigma is the standard deviation of the distribution.

9
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:48,620
In this case, the kernel is also assumed to be Gaussian.

10
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:54,570
A more generalized way to obtain a bandwidth is given by Scott's Rule.

11
00:00:54,570 --> 00:01:00,500
This shows you the formula to obtain the general bandwidth in D dimensions.

12
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:04,420
For a one dimensional case, we put D equals one.

13
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:05,030
In this case,

14
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:10,160
the Sigma here shows the covariance matrix in the D dimensions of the data.

15
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:17,840
In fact, when we determine the kernel density estimate of our data here,

16
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,860
we used the Scott's rule to find our bandwidth.

17
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:28,250
All the different factors we obtained was simply some fraction of

18
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:31,510
the bandwidth obtained using Scott's rule.

19
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:35,740
Notice we also used the Gaussian kernel here to get the KD.
