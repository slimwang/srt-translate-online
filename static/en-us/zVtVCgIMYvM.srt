1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:01,080
As I just mentioned,

2
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:05,320
we're going to briefly explore a new
sample app called Did You Feel It?

3
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:08,400
This app will look at specific
earthquakes and let you know what

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,000
the perceived strength was of the quake
among the people that might of felt it,

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,340
and reported their experience
to the USGS website.

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,144
Here's what the app should look like.

7
00:00:18,144 --> 00:00:20,213
Let me show you where
this data comes from.

8
00:00:20,213 --> 00:00:24,223
On the USGS website,
there's a page called Did You Feel It?

9
00:00:24,223 --> 00:00:26,926
This data is crowd sourced
from earthquake events.

10
00:00:26,926 --> 00:00:31,038
If you feel the earth literally shaking
beneath you, you can go to the USGS

11
00:00:31,038 --> 00:00:34,971
website, find your event and
enter whether or not you felt the quake.

12
00:00:34,971 --> 00:00:36,840
So, let's find recent
earthquake to look up.

13
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:41,027
[BLANK_AUDIO]

14
00:00:41,027 --> 00:00:42,600
If I go to
Significant Earthquake Archive.

15
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,953
[BLANK_AUDIO]

16
00:00:46,953 --> 00:00:51,245
We can look around for earthquakes
that have happened recently and have

17
00:00:51,245 --> 00:00:55,909
a significant magnitude, and I really
want to find one that happened near me.

18
00:00:55,909 --> 00:00:58,431
Here's one that happened in
Borrego Springs, California.

19
00:00:58,431 --> 00:00:59,415
So, let's try this one.

20
00:00:59,415 --> 00:01:04,518
So here, we can see that the earthquake
is a magnitude 5.2 that happened

21
00:01:04,518 --> 00:01:09,226
20 kilometers north northwest
of Borrego Springs, California.

22
00:01:09,226 --> 00:01:10,280
Cool.

23
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:15,650
Right below the event title,
there's an indicator for DYFI.

24
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:18,937
DYFI stands for Did You Feel It and
if I click this item,

25
00:01:18,937 --> 00:01:23,099
it takes me to a map that displays
a colorful map of postal code areas.

26
00:01:23,099 --> 00:01:27,528
This DYFI value is a precede intensity
value that is aggregated across all of

27
00:01:27,528 --> 00:01:31,956
the people who visit the USGS website
and recorded what they felt by clicking

28
00:01:31,956 --> 00:01:35,297
the Did You Feel I,
tell us link near the top of each page.

29
00:01:35,297 --> 00:01:39,330
If you click the Tell Us link,
I can see what form looks like.

30
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:43,010
I can enter my location,
click here the yes or

31
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:46,400
no to indicate whether I felt
the earthquake and then send it away.

32
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:49,050
There's a bunch of
other information I can

33
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:54,750
fill in on this form about what was
my situation during the earthquake?

34
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:56,040
Did it wake me up?

35
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,510
And so on.

36
00:01:57,510 --> 00:02:01,550
For those of you who want to know how
the value for DYFI is calculated,

37
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:03,929
you can follow the link below the video.

38
00:02:03,929 --> 00:02:07,942
For this next exercise, please download
the code for the Did You Feel It app

39
00:02:07,942 --> 00:02:11,391
from the GitHub project link in
the lesson notes below the quiz.

40
00:02:11,391 --> 00:02:15,039
Once you've imported it into Android
Studio, run the app on your device.

41
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:17,180
Here's a secret.

42
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:21,511
When you run this app on your device,
the app is going to crash and

43
00:02:21,511 --> 00:02:23,769
this error dialog will appear.

44
00:02:23,769 --> 00:02:27,563
You need to figure out what exception is
causing the app to crash on launch and

45
00:02:27,563 --> 00:02:29,591
then write your answer in this text box.

46
00:02:29,591 --> 00:02:32,665
There's no need to fix the bug
until later in the lesson.

47
00:02:32,665 --> 00:02:36,870
Just read the logs for now in Android
Studio and see what you can find.
