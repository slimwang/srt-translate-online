00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,520
So, another question is which one of these two do we like better. The choices

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,859
are, we like the first one better, the one that uses isinstance, because its

3
00:00:06,859 --> 00:00:10,316
clearer and easier to understand. The second choice, we like the second one

4
00:00:10,316 --> 00:00:13,999
better, the one that uses hasattr, since that's more versatile and tastier. And

5
00:00:13,999 --> 00:00:17,627
the third choice is, it doesn't really matter since Dave gets eaten either way.

6
00:00:17,628 --> 00:00:20,616
This is somewhat subjective but if you think about the way we might use this

7
00:00:20,616 --> 00:00:22,393
method, I think you can get the right answer.
