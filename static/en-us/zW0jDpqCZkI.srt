1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,070
So, the Python Standard Library suggests that the

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:06,670
function open returns an object of the file

3
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:10,400
type. Now this word object is really interesting

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,930
because we have seen it before. Remember the time

5
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:14,980
when we were drawing squares using the class

6
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:18,490
Turtle? We were writing lines of code like this.

7
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:21,630
This meant that Brad was an object or

8
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:25,340
instance of the class Turtle. Similarly, when we write

9
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:28,900
lines like this, which is quotes equal to open

10
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:31,680
file location, and the file, in our case, was

11
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:34,990
a movie quotes file. We are saying that quotes

12
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:38,560
is an object or an instance of file. Now let's

13
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:41,150
think for a moment, what happens when we run

14
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:43,590
this line of code. When we do run this

15
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:47,050
line of code, a function called _init_ is called

16
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:50,590
from inside the class Turtle. And what that does is

17
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:57,280
that it creates space in memory for the object Brad. Now in the case of open,

18
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,350
even though on surface it looks like we

19
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:02,000
are merely calling a function, and that there

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,480
is no class involved. If you look deep down inside the code for how open was

21
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:11,910
actually implemented inside Python. We will find that

22
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:16,370
open, in turn, is calling some init-like function

23
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:20,410
to create an object of file. All right, that's enough

24
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:24,100
jargon for now. We will talk about instances and objects a

25
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:27,410
little bit later in the course. For now, we can rejoice

26
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:30,450
in the fact that part one of profanity checker is done.
