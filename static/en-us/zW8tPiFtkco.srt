00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,910
The right answer is modula -3 pointers

2
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:06,784
are type-specific. That is, pointers in modula-3

3
00:00:06,784 --> 00:00:09,460
cannot be forged, there's no way to

4
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:13,144
subvert the protection mechanism that is built into

5
00:00:13,144 --> 00:00:19,175
the language. So if I have a data structure defined In Modula-3. And if

6
00:00:19,175 --> 00:00:25,255
I have pointer to the data structure, the only way you can use that pointer,

7
00:00:25,255 --> 00:00:31,109
is as a pointer to that type of data structure. You cannot take a data structure

8
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:35,849
and cast it to appear like something else, this is something that we as C

9
00:00:35,849 --> 00:00:38,851
programmers, maybe very used to doing, but

10
00:00:38,851 --> 00:00:42,723
that's not something that is possible in Modula-3.

11
00:00:42,723 --> 00:00:45,667
And that is what allows us to implement

12
00:00:45,667 --> 00:00:50,359
logical protection domains in Modula-3 Using objects and

13
00:00:50,359 --> 00:00:56,480
capabilities to objects as pointers supported by the programming language.
