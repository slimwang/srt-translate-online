1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,885
Okay, so we want someone with the closest answer to the number of candies in the

2
00:00:05,897 --> 00:00:11,627
jar. So I could do the number of candies in the jar minus the number of candies

3
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:17,478
guessed. So for Katie, there were 734 candies in the jar, minus 743, her guess.

4
00:00:17,599 --> 00:00:24,173
I have positive 734, and negative 743. I know that this number is more negative.

5
00:00:24,311 --> 00:00:31,112
It's nine more negative. So I have negative 9. For Kogure I had 734 candies in

6
00:00:31,124 --> 00:00:37,444
the jar minus 728, her guess. And I got 6. For Andy, he was off by 20. And

7
00:00:37,456 --> 00:00:42,912
Kathleen negative 12. There's one problem with these results. We want to know

8
00:00:42,924 --> 00:00:47,999
who was the closest to the number of candies in the jar. Katie's guess was off

9
00:00:48,011 --> 00:00:53,137
by 9. She guessed 743. And she was actually over by 9. She went too high. So in

10
00:00:53,149 --> 00:00:58,224
this case, a negative sign means we were over our guess. Kogure was 6 candies

11
00:00:58,236 --> 00:01:03,235
off. She was under. She guessed 728. 728 is less than 734. So in this case, a

12
00:01:03,247 --> 00:01:08,135
positive 6 would mean that she was under. Andy guessed 714 and that was 20

13
00:01:08,147 --> 00:01:13,360
candies away from the answer. Kathleen was also over. She guessed 746, so she

14
00:01:13,372 --> 00:01:18,585
was 12 units above. The positive and negatives mean something in this context.

15
00:01:18,697 --> 00:01:23,808
The negatives mean that we were above the guess like Katie and Kathleen. For

16
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:28,112
Kogure and Andy, however, they guessed below the number of candies in the jar,

17
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:32,222
so they wound up with a positive answer, based on our model. Remember, I

18
00:01:32,234 --> 00:01:36,684
shouldn't really care about the negative and positives here. I just want to know

19
00:01:36,696 --> 00:01:41,074
who was the closest to the number of candies in the jar. I'm only concerned with

20
00:01:41,086 --> 00:01:45,134
how far away everyone's guess was from 734. I don't care if the result was

21
00:01:45,146 --> 00:01:49,913
negative or positive. If I want to know the absolute difference, I should use

22
00:01:49,925 --> 00:01:54,633
absolute value. This is the symbol that we saw at the start of this lesson.

23
00:01:54,742 --> 00:01:59,763
Absolute value is the distance from zero. It just says how far away we are from

24
00:01:59,775 --> 00:02:04,771
zero. So Katie's guess was really 9 candies off. Kogure's guess was 6 candies

25
00:02:04,783 --> 00:02:09,491
off. Andy's guess was 20 units off, and Kathleen's guess was 12 units off.

26
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:13,887
Notice that the absolute value took the positive res ult of all the numbers.

27
00:02:13,985 --> 00:02:16,039
Let's look at this in another example.
