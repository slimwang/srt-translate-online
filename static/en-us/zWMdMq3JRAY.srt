1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:04,580
But what if we wanted to rationalize the denominator that looked like this. If

2
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:08,346
we multiplied our original fraction by the root of 7 divided by the root of 7.

3
00:00:08,346 --> 00:00:12,798
We would still wind up with a radical in our denominator. So this wouldn't

4
00:00:12,798 --> 00:00:16,752
work. Keep in mind, when we're multiplying, we would just distribute this root

5
00:00:16,752 --> 00:00:21,311
7 to each of these terms, to get 7 minus root 35. Likewise, if we were to

6
00:00:21,311 --> 00:00:24,914
multiply by the root of 5 divided by the root of 5. We would still get an

7
00:00:24,914 --> 00:00:29,944
expression that contained a radical in our denominator. And that's no good. So

8
00:00:29,944 --> 00:00:33,535
we need a different way to be able to simplify this denominator so it doesn't

9
00:00:33,535 --> 00:00:35,803
contain these radicals.
