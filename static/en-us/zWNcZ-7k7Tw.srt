1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:00,990
All right, so

2
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:05,410
your goal is to select the top level
Udacity navigation bar up here.

3
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:08,160
So let's start out like we always do,
and try and inspect this element.

4
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:13,020
When I inspect this element,
I get taken to this navbar-header,

5
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:16,710
and it doesn't seem like I'm
selecting the entire navbar.

6
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:20,460
If I look one level up, I have a
container, and then if I look one level

7
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:25,180
even higher, I have a nav element,
which looks like my topmost element.

8
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:27,120
All right, this must be it.

9
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,620
So this element has a lot
of different class names.

10
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:34,180
I have navbar, navbar-inverse,
and navbar-static-top.

11
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:37,370
So let's try one of these to see if
it will work in our query selector.

12
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:41,450
So just trying the first one,
I'm going to run this, and

13
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:44,090
sure enough,
I get the DOM node that I want.

14
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:47,150
Now, it's also worth mentioning that
these other class names would have

15
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:47,805
worked, as well.

16
00:00:47,805 --> 00:00:51,715
navbar-inverse also returns
the correct DOM node, and

17
00:00:51,715 --> 00:00:54,300
navbar-static-top works, as well.

18
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:57,730
And if you're wondering if a combination
of the class names would work, well,

19
00:00:57,730 --> 00:00:59,350
in this case it wouldn't, but

20
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:03,116
this is because I've separated
the class names by a space.

21
00:01:03,116 --> 00:01:06,790
If I would have looked for two class
names or an element that has a class of

22
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:11,800
navbar and a class of navbar-inverse,
then I would get the correct DOM node.

23
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:14,230
So any single class
name would have worked,

24
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:19,051
as well as any pair of class names, or
all three class names would have worked.

25
00:01:19,051 --> 00:01:22,650
This just goes to show you that there's
many different ways to select elements,

26
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:24,420
so keep that in mind
throughout this course.
