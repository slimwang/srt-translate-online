1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,910
I want to introduce we're going to
keep doing this Kalman Filter now on

2
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:04,560
the 1D state.

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:07,620
And I want to introduce
a little bit of nomenclature.

4
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:10,640
Some a way of writing things down.

5
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:15,230
So what we have here is, we have this
inner loop that we talked about.

6
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:19,220
Where we predict, make a measurement
correct and then time advances.

7
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:20,090
Okay.

8
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:23,930
So we time advance we predict,
we make a measurement we correct.

9
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:27,030
The first thing I want to show is,
in our prediction,

10
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:31,050
which is probability of x t given
the measurements up through t minus 1,

11
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:36,670
our prediction in Kalman land here
is going to be model written as,

12
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:40,330
mu minus sigma minus,
sigma squared minus right.

13
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:43,120
This is and see of timed t.

14
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,130
So mu minus sub t, sigma squared or

15
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:51,010
sigma minus sub t,
that's the prediction of the mean and

16
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:55,500
the co-variance before I take
the measurement at time t.

17
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:58,950
That's why it's referred to as minus.

18
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:01,420
Then I take my measurement.

19
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:02,060
All right.

20
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:04,470
And my corrected version, which is now,

21
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:09,480
the, the distribution of x given
the new measurement y sub t is referred

22
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:14,350
to as mu plus sub t sigma squared or
sigma plus sub t.

23
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:15,890
So I have these two things.

24
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:17,140
I have mu minus.

25
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:20,645
Sigma minus the time t that's
the prediction before the measurement.

26
00:01:20,645 --> 00:01:22,770
Mu plus sigma plus at time t,

27
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:25,640
that's my correction after
I've taken my measurement.
