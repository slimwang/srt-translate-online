1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:01,050
Jessica.
>> Hm?

2
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:02,200
We need to talk.

3
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:02,900
>> What?
What's up?

4
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:06,510
>> We've been hand-holding them way
too much, and it has got to stop.

5
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:07,300
>> What?
>> Okay,

6
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:09,760
we've been in the kiddie pool for
way too long.

7
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,420
We've been giving them
all these instructions,

8
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:12,470
telling them what to do next.

9
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:16,030
But then when they're out in the real
world working on their own project,

10
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:17,020
they're going to get stuck.

11
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:19,110
They're not going to
know what to do next.

12
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:21,140
And when they're in the deep end,
they might drown.

13
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:22,850
You don't want them to drown, right?

14
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:24,590
Whoa, whoa, whoa, that's super extreme.

15
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:25,930
All right, so let's compromise.

16
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:30,192
So how bout for the next feature of
adding images to the app we'll help them

17
00:00:30,192 --> 00:00:34,748
by thinking of strategies to execute and
then what orders to execute those in.

18
00:00:34,748 --> 00:00:35,510
>> Okay.

19
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:36,720
I could see that working out.

20
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:39,510
But no more hand holding after that.

21
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:42,650
>> All right, so we've come to a key
point in every developer's workflow.

22
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:46,890
The app is functioning and it tells the
users about the Miwok translations for

23
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:48,210
the English words.

24
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:52,590
Now a feature request has come in to add
images to the app, and we discussed it

25
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:55,890
with our designer, and this is what
we'd like the app to look like.

26
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:57,720
So if you're on a team it's common for

27
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:02,620
you as a developer to take on a single
feature, like adding images to the app.

28
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:06,860
It's also common for a Program Manager
or Tech Lead of your team to ask you for

29
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:10,160
a time estimate of how long it'll
take you to build out a feature.

30
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:12,460
So I won't ask you for a time estimate.

31
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:14,650
But I do want you to estimate
the scope of your work.

32
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:20,010
So at a high level, what changes
to the app needs to be made?

33
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:23,950
So you may be thinking,
I understand what we need to achieve and

34
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:28,110
why, but I'm not sure
the next steps to get there.

35
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:31,240
And I'm not even sure how to
determine the scope of the work.

36
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:33,990
Well all those thoughts
are perfectly normal and

37
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:36,110
that's why we're here to help.

38
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:39,090
So one of the first things we can
do to plan is to make sure we have

39
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:41,080
a mental map of our code base.

40
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:43,130
And review how everything fits together.

41
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:48,060
So you may have noticed,
our code has gotten quite complex.

42
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:51,780
There's multiple layout files,
a few Java files, and

43
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,940
a couple more resources as well.

44
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:58,300
So using a mental model, we can peer
into our code and anticipate and

45
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:01,600
visualize all the medications
that we'll need to make

46
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,550
to the different parts of the code base.

47
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:07,690
Depending on the feature it could
mean affecting many different files.

48
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:10,660
So having a mental map
will help us anticipate

49
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:11,839
where we'll need to make changes.

50
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,800
So let's revisit our mental
diagram from lesson one.

51
00:02:17,458 --> 00:02:21,200
We filled out a lot more
features since then, and

52
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,140
we've made some modifications
to it slightly.

53
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:28,410
Now there's no rules for
how to create a proper mental model

54
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:31,050
as long as you can keep track of
all the major parts of the app.

55
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:36,600
So since the app is getting more
complex we can zoom out a bit,

56
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,830
meaning we don't have to include all
the details that we originally had.

57
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:44,230
So we know that they're still there but
they're just not at the top of our mind.

58
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:48,834
So currently this is
a model of our app flow so

59
00:02:48,834 --> 00:02:53,116
tapping on each category takes
us to the appropriate activity.

60
00:02:53,116 --> 00:02:56,207
[BLANK_AUDIO]

61
00:02:56,207 --> 00:02:59,070
We've also taken a look at
how each activity, gets and

62
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:00,820
displays the appropriate data.

63
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,930
So let's focus in on
the NumbersActivity.

64
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:08,310
We store data in word
objects inside an array list.

65
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:11,880
And retrieved and
display that information

66
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:15,710
in each list item using the list
view and array adapter combination.

67
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:20,280
So in the next node you'll see
the two diagrams of our current mental

68
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:20,859
model of the app.

69
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:27,000
So to help us scope out our new
feature of adding images to each word,

70
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,890
what changes will we need to make
to each of the two diagrams?

71
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:34,210
Now assume that the PhrasesActivity
will not be showing images,

72
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:36,969
and will be a special case
that will be handled later.

73
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:39,600
So ignore that difference for now.

74
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:44,810
Now remember this is a thought
exercise to help you began planning

75
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:46,770
how you'll build out your next feature.

76
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:48,590
So there's no right or wrong answer.

77
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:51,620
And when you're done,

78
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:55,110
I'd like you check this box when you've
sketched out your potential solutions.
