00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:05,530
The structural models that we have been looking at so far express properties of

2
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:10,620
systems that are true at all times. Although, these models are general,

3
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:15,950
they fail to convey interesting behavioral aspects of the systems.

4
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:22,300
That is how the systems respond to external stimuli. UML provides a variety

5
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:28,960
of alternative diagrams that do support the behavioral modeling of systems.

6
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:34,330
We will look at these and later we will also go into detail on the state chart

7
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:39,870
diagramming technique. Which is the one which provides you the ability to.

8
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:44,250
Precisely describe the system properties.
