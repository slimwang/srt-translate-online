This can be written as log base 5 of 25 equals 2. Nice thinking if you found

2
00:00:07,464 --> 00:00:12,417
this. Remember that the base for this equation becomes the base of our

3
00:00:12,417 --> 00:00:18,764
logarithm, and that the logarithm of any number Is an exponent. This means log

4
00:00:18,764 --> 00:00:25,380
base five of 25 must equal 2. We're asking ourselves, what do we raise five to

5
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:29,290
in order to get 25? That power is 2.
