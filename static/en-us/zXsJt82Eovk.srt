00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:03,114
We've seen how we can use the product rule to simplify a radical by splitting

2
00:00:03,114 --> 00:00:07,516
it up into the multiplication of two different radicals. We can also use this

3
00:00:07,516 --> 00:00:11,440
product rule to multiply two radicals together, but note that we can only do

4
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:15,688
that when the radicals have the same root. In this case, they're both square

5
00:00:15,688 --> 00:00:18,900
roots, so we can multiply them together. If we had two third roots or two

6
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:23,528
fourth roots, then we could also multiply them together. This number, which is

7
00:00:23,528 --> 00:00:28,370
our index, just needs to match. So use our product rule here to simplify each

8
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:32,456
of these multiplication problems. And don't worry about simplifying in the end,

9
00:00:32,456 --> 00:00:35,373
because you actually can't in these cases.
