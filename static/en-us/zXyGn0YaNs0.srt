00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:03,110
Let's now talk about various problems that

2
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:07,630
resulted from IPv4 and the growth of the

3
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:10,750
internet routing tables, and two different solutions

4
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:14,140
to internet routing table growth: network address translation,

5
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:20,720
or NAT, and IPv6. So the main problem that we are seeing is that IPv4

6
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:25,720
addresses have only 32 bits, which means that there are, can only be a total of

7
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:31,150
2 to the 32 unique IP addresses. Not only that, as we've seen, IP

8
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:34,770
addresses are allocated in blocks, and fragmentation

9
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:38,640
of this space can mean that IPv4 addresses

10
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,520
can be quickly exhausted. In fact, we've

11
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,130
already seen the last slash eight from IPv4

12
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:48,750
address space allocated to the registries. So

13
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:51,070
we're well on our way towards running out

14
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:55,100
of IPv4 addresses. In some sense, you can say that we've

15
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:58,010
essentially already run out. In this lesson, we're going to look at

16
00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:03,310
two solutions: network address translation, or NAT, and IPv6, whose main

17
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:07,670
feature is 128 bit addresses. Let's first take a look at NAT.
