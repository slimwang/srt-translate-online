1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:02,000
So this is what your end
result should look like.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,310
It's going to be a public void, and

3
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:06,070
accepts a status
parameter incall status.

4
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:09,980
If status.isSuccess is true, then you're
just going to make a toast called

5
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:12,550
Geofences Added, and show that toast.

6
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:15,660
Otherwise, create an error message and

7
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:19,720
get this status code from the status
itself, and then log this out.

8
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:22,610
And this will happen if adding
the geofences actually failed.

9
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:23,780
That's the complete OnResult.

10
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:24,730
It's pretty straightforward.
