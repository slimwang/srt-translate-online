00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,920
To help you learn new material, we created a unique

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:07,720
concept map for each lesson. Here's an incomplete map for lesson

3
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:11,120
1 that you can also download from the instructor's notes.

4
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,420
Print it out or just keep it handy, and see if

5
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:16,090
you can fill in the empty blanks. As you go

6
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:19,110
along. At the end of the lesson there will be an

7
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:22,280
opportunity for you to fill in the missing words to see

8
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:25,520
a complete version. If you prefer to have the complete version

9
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:28,930
as you go through the lesson just skip to the end of this lesson and

10
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:30,200
look in the instructor's notes for the

11
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:33,120
complete concept map of Lesson One. I highly

12
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,750
encourage you to try using the incomplete

13
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:37,350
version now though. Filling in your own notes

14
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:39,360
as the lesson progresses and then checking out

15
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,640
the completed map at the end after finishing.
