1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,029
We'll need to pass in some values in order to

2
00:00:02,029 --> 00:00:03,830
meaningfully discuss this question.

3
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:05,220
So, let's make some here.

4
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:08,440
Furthermore, I'm going to make the variable names reflect the color of

5
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:09,830
the value that they store.

6
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:13,590
At this point, now that we have some values, we can finally call the function,

7
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:15,670
passing in a couple of the objects that we've made, so

8
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:17,070
we can see how they're treated.

9
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:20,240
Input parameters to a function only have bindings when that

10
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,850
function is actually running.

11
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:24,750
So only now that we have an example of invocation can we really

12
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:29,180
meaningfully evaluate what we expect parameter two to be bound to.

13
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:31,280
So what do you expect to be logged in this example?
