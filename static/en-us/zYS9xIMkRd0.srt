00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,073
So, I really just want to add 4/10 and 3/10. So, here's another kilometer bar,

2
00:00:05,179 --> 00:00:10,453
and I'm going to fill it with both the 4/10 and the 3/10. This would be 4/10 of

3
00:00:10,465 --> 00:00:15,363
a kilometer and this would be another 3/10 of a kilometer. So, altogether, I

4
00:00:15,375 --> 00:00:18,216
have 7/10. If you said 7/10, nice work.
