00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:03,500
Microservices architectures,
what does that term even mean?

2
00:00:04,522 --> 00:00:08,420
>> Well, microservices is just
a architectural approach to designing

3
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:13,840
applications in a way that's modular,
easy to deploy, and scale independently.

4
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,870
>> But given all the benefits,
doesn't make sense for

5
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:16,770
everyone to just move to them?

6
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,180
>> A lot of the benefits of
the microservices design pattern

7
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:24,965
applies to any application,
even your traditional web application.

8
00:00:24,965 --> 00:00:28,070
Microservices just happen to benefit
more from rapid deployments and

9
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:29,640
continuous delivery.

10
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,915
Microservices also push the limits
of most automation tools and

11
00:00:32,915 --> 00:00:35,555
infrastructure in place
today to their limits.

12
00:00:35,555 --> 00:00:38,030
>> Okay, that makes sense now.

13
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:41,665
Microservices are one of the reasons we
need advanced tools, like Kubernetes.
