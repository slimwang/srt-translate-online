00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:05,141
So let's see if we can figure out how we
should allocate memory in a NUMA System

2
00:00:05,141 --> 00:00:06,910
so that it works well.

3
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:10,620
Our operating system should
put the stack pages for

4
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:13,400
core N in the memory slice N.

5
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:19,020
Put all data pages ever touched by
core N in the memory slice N, and

6
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:24,730
put all data pages mostly accessed
by Core N in the memory slice N.

7
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:28,270
More than one of these
could be correct or

8
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:30,750
potentially, none of them are correct.

9
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:32,920
You need to select all that are correct.

10
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:34,550
What should the operating system do?
