00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:04,360
We can represent these finite state machines in a variety of ways.

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:07,650
Let's start with a tabular form called a state transition table.

3
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:12,070
Here the rows correspond to states and there are four columns. One column for

4
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:17,120
the name of the state. Another for the input event which is going to

5
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:21,590
cause a transition. The third for whatever output action is going to

6
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:26,590
be taken upon the transition, and the fourth for the next state. That is,

7
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:31,390
the state transition table is going to capture the idea that a system in

8
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:36,240
a given state, when given a certain stimulus, and when a stimulus occurs.

9
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:41,400
Is possibly going to produce some action or response, and

10
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:47,500
leave itself in a in a state, possibly the same or possibly a different state.

11
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:52,915
To see how this works, let's imagine a garage door opening system. In fact, a,

12
00:00:52,915 --> 00:00:58,080
a simplified version of my garage door opening system. Okay. It's gotta motor

13
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:02,630
and that motor can be lifting the door up, it can be pushing the door down, or

14
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:08,450
it can be stopped. There's a button that can be pressed to turn the motor on and

15
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:14,220
off. The door itself can be all the way open, all the way closed,

16
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:18,120
or stopped at some intermediate intermediate state along the way.

17
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:24,470
Importantly, the, is what happens when you press the button, and

18
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:30,026
in this particular garage door situation, okay. What happens when you

19
00:01:30,026 --> 00:01:33,650
press the button can be one of three things depending upon what state you're in.

20
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:38,080
If the motor is stopped and you press the button, it starts going but

21
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:43,400
in the opposite direction it was going before. If the motor is going upward and

22
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:49,200
you hit the button, it stops, leaving the door wherever it was at that time.

23
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,250
However, for security or safety reasons, if the motor's going downward and

24
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:57,460
you press the button, it not only stops but then it immediately turns on and

25
00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:02,130
goes in the other direction. Presumably because something was detected that

26
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:06,910
might be damaged by the door going down on it. And implicit in this is

27
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:10,850
some sensors. One sensor determining whether the door is all the way up, and

28
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:13,300
another sensor saying whether the door is all the way down.
