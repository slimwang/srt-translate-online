1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,680
Okay, let's take a look at the code.

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:06,510
Over here, in activity_main.xml
is the code for the new button.

3
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:11,130
It's very similar to the other buttons,
and the onClick is showDailySpecial.

4
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:11,950
And see here.

5
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:12,760
Just the third button.

6
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:15,380
It just shows up as another
button on the main screen.

7
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:18,040
And here's the code in main
activity that gets invoked

8
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:20,250
when the user clicks show
daily special button.

9
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:23,310
Very simple, takes a view,
because it's a button on click and

10
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:26,565
it sends an intent to start
the show daily special activity.

11
00:00:26,565 --> 00:00:30,215
Let's take a look at
the Show Daily Special Activity itself.

12
00:00:30,215 --> 00:00:32,335
So here I hard wired the daily special.

13
00:00:32,335 --> 00:00:34,565
You can make that be whatever you want.

14
00:00:34,565 --> 00:00:37,395
This is the same code for
putting information into the info box.

15
00:00:37,395 --> 00:00:39,567
This is for
the other screens like show recipe.

16
00:00:39,567 --> 00:00:41,487
We get the TextView.

17
00:00:41,487 --> 00:00:42,827
We set the heading.

18
00:00:42,827 --> 00:00:46,397
And we put information into the info
box in this case the DailySpecial.

19
00:00:47,457 --> 00:00:50,297
And then down here, the order online,
this is just the method

20
00:00:50,297 --> 00:00:54,717
that gets invoked by the order
online button, as before.

21
00:00:54,717 --> 00:00:57,875
We just send an intent to
start the OrderDinnerActivity.

22
00:00:57,875 --> 00:01:00,620
Passing the dinner,
in this case, the daily special.

23
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:03,580
Now moving onto the layout file for
show daily special.

24
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:05,890
It's a scroll view with a linear layout.

25
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:09,240
It uses the info box fragment
to display the daily special.

26
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:13,600
And it has a button for
ordering online, and that's it.
