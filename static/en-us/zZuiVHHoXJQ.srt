00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:01,800
What did you write down, David?

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:04,120
>> So, in this case,
the only difference between this and

3
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:07,470
the previous positive example is that
now it's lunch instead of breakfast.

4
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:10,070
So, the only thing we're going to
generalize here is that now it can be

5
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:12,850
any meal instead of just
being breakfast, but

6
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:15,300
we're still going to say that
it has to be Kim's on Friday.

7
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:17,380
It has to be cheap,
and it can't be vegan.

8
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:20,540
>> And note that they could have put
here breakfast or lunch, but for

9
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:22,380
simplicity has generalized
it to any meal.
