day that will not bring a new challenge.

challenges that students will face

00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:27,190
less, will convert and pay for it?

8
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:31,790
In many cases, you should focus and
narrow this search.

9
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:32,580
Less is more here.

10
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:38,280
If you can focus on a niche segment in
the market, you will get a better chance

of the users drove 95% of the revenue.

26
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:35,844
