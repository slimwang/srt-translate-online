1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The answer is the MDPs are designed to do stochastic control.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
POMDPs are designed to deal with partial observability.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Reinforcement learning deals with an unknown environment,

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
and the heuristic function and A* search and Monte Carlo techniques

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
are used to deal with computational limitations.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Monte Carlo techniques gives us an approximation.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
The heuristic function, if we use the right one, still gives us the right answer,

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
but deals with the computational complexity.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 99:59:59,999
We don't as yet have any technology that's specifically designed to deal with adversaries.
