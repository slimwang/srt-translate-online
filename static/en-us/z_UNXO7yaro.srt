00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:06,010
All of us routinely use file systems. Quite often, not the one that is

2
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:11,480
on our local machine, be it a desktop or laptop, but one that is on a local area

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:15,770
network, connecting us to a workplace or university.

4
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:19,910
NFS, which stands for Network File System. And

5
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:26,190
just like the word xerox is used often as a verb, to denote copying, NFS has

6
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:28,680
become a generic name to signify any file

7
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:32,540
system that we access remotely. So here is

8
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:37,466
a trivia quiz for you. NFS is a name given to the first network file system that

9
00:00:37,466 --> 00:00:42,700
was ever built. In this question I want you to name the company and the year

10
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:46,570
that NFS was first built. And the company

11
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:50,600
choices for you are all familiar names: IBM, Sun

12
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:55,410
Microsystems, HP, Apple, Microsoft, and

13
00:00:55,410 --> 00:01:01,684
Google. And here are the choices of years for you 1975, 85, 95, 2005.
