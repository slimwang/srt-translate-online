00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Let me ask you another question.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
What is the value of this function if we go to the point where it's maximum,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
which is x = µ? That's the way to write this.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Compute for me in your head this what this thing will be when x = µ.
