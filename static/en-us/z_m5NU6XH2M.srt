1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,380
The second important decision is the design of the

2
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:05,890
interconnect, or how the line cards should be connected to

3
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:08,760
one another. Now one possibility is to use a shared

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:12,510
bus. But the disadvantage of a bus for the interconnect

5
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:14,692
is that it can only be used by one

6
00:00:14,692 --> 00:00:18,530
input-output combination. In any single time slot. What we'd like

7
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:22,430
to do is enable input output pairs that don't compete

8
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:25,440
to send traffic from input to output during the same

9
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:28,260
time slot. For example, one should be able to send to

10
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:31,350
four, two to six and three to five, all in the same

11
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:35,260
time slot. The solution to this problem is to create what's

12
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:40,360
called. A crossbar switch, or sometimes is also called a switched backplane.
