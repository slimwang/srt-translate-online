00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,180
Here's another example, which basically
talks about the registration and

2
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:07,380
blending effects that we have talked
about with panoramas, except,

3
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:08,410
now applied to video.

4
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:11,530
Again, something done in my group,
just showing you an example.

5
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:15,120
Here, you basically see
us warping around, and

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,570
moving the different view points.

7
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:20,420
There are five players still
moving around, and basically,

8
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:22,510
it comes from four different views.

9
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:27,050
All of them have some overlap,
we can register them together, and

10
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:30,920
as we move around different view points,
they get warped and morphed.

11
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:34,610
Of course, sometimes the view changes,
you can see some things kind of vanish,

12
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:36,850
but they appear from
a different view point.

13
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:40,880
So, in essence, in this instance what
we've done is basically, interpolated

14
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:46,070
and generated novel views by basically
being able to look for information

15
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:52,080
on the playground, and apply that to
be able to then model a virtual views.

16
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:55,650
Again, something we looked at when we
looked at things like morphing and

17
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:58,880
panoramas, except,
this time around applied to videos
