00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:04,680
In this section, we'll learn about
aggregating or summarizing data.

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:08,940
For example, you might want to summarize
transactional data that list each

3
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:12,749
product sold within one
transaction as separate records.

4
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:17,790
So if you wanted to calculate
the total sale of a transaction,

5
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:21,560
you'd need to sum up the products
within each transaction.

6
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:24,980
Or maybe you want to count
the number of tweets associated

7
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:27,850
with a store location
in a particular month.

8
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:30,630
Then you'd need to count these
up within that time frame.

9
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:34,800
If we think back to the example
mentioned at the beginning of

10
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,700
the lesson,
we have daily sales data, and

11
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:42,310
we want to build a forecasting
model to forecast monthly sales.

12
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:46,260
Then the data going into the model is
going to need to be aggregated, so

13
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:48,600
that each record represents
a monthly value.

14
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:53,720
If you were going to summarize
this data by month in Excel,

15
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:57,060
you'd need to create a pivot
table from the daily sales data.
