1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,890
Since the fetch weather task is in the fragment, the

2
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:05,930
menu option to trigger that task should be inside the fragment

3
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:08,320
too. That means we should create a new menu layout

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,390
for the fragment and we'll call it forecastfragment.xml. The file will

5
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:15,770
live within the menu folder under the Resources directory. Inside

6
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:19,200
that file, we'll declare the new menu option for refresh and

7
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,140
give it this menu item ID. We'll also need to define

8
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:25,290
a string label for this word, Refresh. We're taking this one

9
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:27,440
step at a time, so just make the menu xml

10
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:30,250
file change in this exercise. If you compile and run

11
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:33,060
the app, there'll be no visible change. It won't show

12
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:35,500
up on the device yet because we haven't inflated the menu

13
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:38,270
item. Inflating it will be in the coding test after

14
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:41,550
this. See how the menu main.xml is implemented as an

15
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:44,860
example. For an additional hint, see the menu training guide

00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:47,150
below. When you're done, you can click on this box here.
