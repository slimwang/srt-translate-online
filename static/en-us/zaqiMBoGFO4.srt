00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:05,450
Next concept is information hiding, developed by David Parnas. And

2
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:11,010
it has to do with encapsulating the capabilities that a particular module

3
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:16,160
has behind an abstract interface. After all, if the rest of the world

4
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:21,430
that's going to make use of that module only knows the abstract interface.

5
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:25,990
It gives you freedom later to change the implementation details without breaking

6
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:30,420
all the client programs. One key example of information hiding is if

7
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:35,230
you're dealing with a system that has access to many hardware devices,

8
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:39,100
hiding that access to the devices behind an abstract interface.

9
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:43,600
See if you can come up with some other good examples of places in

10
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,870
the system where you might like to hide information behind abstract interfaces.

11
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:54,240
Some typical examples include access to a database or some server some place,

12
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:59,320
the specifics of an algorithm or how you're implementing, a data structure.
