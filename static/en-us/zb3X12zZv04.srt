00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,481
So you probably noticed in the
Conference Central code that as we build

2
00:00:03,481 --> 00:00:07,383
up a query with filters, we've been
re-assigning the variable q like this.

3
00:00:07,383 --> 00:00:09,125
But there's a somewhat
neater way to do this.

4
00:00:09,125 --> 00:00:13,513
Every one of these filter and order
methods returns an updated query object.

5
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:16,312
That means we can just use
method chaining, like this.

6
00:00:16,312 --> 00:00:19,390
We can compose a complex query
all on one line of code, or

7
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:23,069
a few lines of code with backslashes
as continuation characters.

8
00:00:23,069 --> 00:00:27,441
So how would you write a query to filter
for conferences in Tokyo with at least

9
00:00:27,441 --> 00:00:32,220
one, but less than ten seats available,
sorted by the number of seats available,

10
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:35,247
then by the conference name,
and then by the month?

11
00:00:35,247 --> 00:00:36,640
Fill in the query here in Python.
