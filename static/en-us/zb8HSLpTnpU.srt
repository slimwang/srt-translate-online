1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:05,300
Operating systems play a really
important role in computer systems.

2
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:09,880
In fact, when we talk about computers,
we often say the operating system

3
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:15,970
running on a certain kind of computer,
a Windows machine, or an iOS device.

4
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:20,870
We're going to see that operating
systems play an extremely important and

5
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:23,780
critical role when it
comes to protecting and

6
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:27,950
securing resources that we
have in our computer systems.

7
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:31,900
So let's look at what
a computer system is actually.

8
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:34,028
So we actually start with the hardware.

9
00:00:34,028 --> 00:00:39,510
Your hardware consists of a CPU,
perhaps you have memory,

10
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:43,990
and other IO devices, so
that's the hardware that we have.

11
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:46,440
Now if you wanted to use
the hardware directly,

12
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:47,880
it's going to be pretty difficult.

13
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:50,840
In fact no one does that.

14
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:54,980
What we really do is run
a really important program,

15
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:57,760
actually operating system
is kind of a program,

16
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:02,320
that handles the low level
hardware resources that we have.

17
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,660
So your operating system
may be Windows or

18
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:08,440
Android, or
a number of these operating systems.

19
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:11,020
What we generally start
with the hardware

20
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:14,150
run the operating system on
that device that we have.

21
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:19,120
And the applications that we directly
deal with, that we run on our systems,

22
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:25,030
so this could be your browser, let's
say, or this could be your mail client.

23
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:29,160
So these applications then actually
running on top of the operating system.

24
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:33,420
One way to think about this picture
that we have for a computer system is

25
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:38,110
that hardware is where we have
the real or physical resources.

26
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:42,490
We're going to run an operating
system to control access to those

27
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:47,040
hardware resources, and those resources
then are going to be made available to

28
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,920
the various applications that we have.

29
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,035
So, if any of the these resources
had to be protected in case

30
00:01:54,035 --> 00:01:56,315
we have different
applications running here.

31
00:01:56,315 --> 00:01:59,335
The reason the operating system plays
a really important role is because

32
00:01:59,335 --> 00:02:02,875
the operating system gets
between these applications and

33
00:02:02,875 --> 00:02:04,515
how they can access the resources.
