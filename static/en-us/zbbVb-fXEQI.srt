00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:02,560
Here's how I found the answers.

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:05,450
To evaluate A at these
fourth roots of unity,

3
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:09,620
I first evaluated this polynomial
Ae at the second roots of unity.

4
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:16,900
Note that Ae here is 1 plus x.

5
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:22,560
Thus Aee, the even of those terms,
is just 1.

6
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:27,970
And Aoe is the odd of those terms,
the coefficient here is 1 as well.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,770
So I can just write 1 and
1 in those slots.

8
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:37,670
Applying these formulas then
tells me that Ae of 1 is 2 and

9
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:39,678
Ae of negative 1 is 0.

10
00:00:39,678 --> 00:00:47,680
With this done, now I'm ready to find
the values of Ao at its roots of unity.

11
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:55,240
Ao consists of the odd coefficients
here, so it's 0 minus x,

12
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:59,952
and the even of these is the 0 and
the odd of those is negative 1.

13
00:00:59,952 --> 00:01:03,870
So I go ahead and
write those in those slots.

14
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:09,340
Applying these formulas then tells
me that Ao of one is negative 1 and

15
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:12,120
Ao of negative 1 is 1.

16
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:15,550
With all these values computed
we can now apply the rules for

17
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:21,070
our final layer to obtain the answer
which I calculated to be this.
