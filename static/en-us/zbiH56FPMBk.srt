1
00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:05,590
You've just worked with the question class and now its time to form a Subclass.

2
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:09,370
We've all seen these multiple choice questions, as a question and there're

3
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:14,044
multiple choices hence the name. By the way, if you ever want to know what's

4
00:00:14,044 --> 00:00:17,702
the original name of the Java language, it was Oak, which was a name that was

5
00:00:17,702 --> 00:00:23,308
so dull and boring that they changed it. Now, of course, one could put this

6
00:00:23,308 --> 00:00:28,180
entire text here into a question class and set the answer to this string three.

7
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:31,962
But that too would be dull and boring. It would be better to have a class that

8
00:00:31,962 --> 00:00:36,245
specifically deals with multiple-choice questions. So that we could declare an

9
00:00:36,245 --> 00:00:41,020
object, somewhat like this. We make a Choice Question, that's what I'm calling

10
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:44,604
this class. We still need to set the text of course, but then for the choices I

11
00:00:44,604 --> 00:00:47,628
want to be able to call a method that I call addChoice that adds the particular

12
00:00:47,628 --> 00:00:52,600
choice and then specifies whether it's false or true. When I formed the Choice

13
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:56,360
Question class, I didn't want to start from scratch. I want to inherit as much

14
00:00:56,360 --> 00:01:01,409
as possible from the question class that's already written. Let's see how to do

15
00:01:01,409 --> 00:01:06,090
that. I'll define the ChoiceQuestion class and then I specify that it extends

16
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:10,314
the question class, that's the Java keyword for denoting that ChoiseQuestion

17
00:01:10,314 --> 00:01:15,821
should become a subclass of question. Into the body of the subclass, I put in

18
00:01:15,821 --> 00:01:20,634
any new methods that are present in the subclass but not the super class. Such

19
00:01:20,634 --> 00:01:24,320
as the Add Choice Method. You also put in the implementations of any methods

20
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:28,247
that needed to change in the sub class. For example, we'll need to change the

21
00:01:28,247 --> 00:01:31,161
display method, since displaying a choice question must also display the

22
00:01:31,161 --> 00:01:35,648
choices. And finally, you of course need to add any instance variables that the

23
00:01:35,648 --> 00:01:40,648
choice question class needs to do its job. In our case, that would be the list

24
00:01:40,648 --> 00:01:45,912
of the choices. The key point is what you don't put in here. When you define a

25
00:01:45,912 --> 00:01:48,984
subclass, you never include any of the methods from the superclass that work

26
00:01:48,984 --> 00:01:53,466
just fine. For example, the set text method will work fine, and we can simply

27
00:01:53,466 --> 00:01:57,486
inherit it from the superclass. Also, you don't want to include any fields from

28
00:01:57,486 --> 00:02:00,910
the superclass. You get those automatically, and if you were to include them

29
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:05,725
again, you'd get 'em twice, which is not good. The point is that, what you put

30
00:02:05,725 --> 00:02:09,905
inside here is the difference from the superclass. Everything that the subclass

31
00:02:09,905 --> 00:02:12,772
has, that the superclass doesn't have at all or that it doesn't have in the

32
00:02:12,772 --> 00:02:17,280
same way. Let's have a closer look at exactly how that works for question and

33
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:23,993
choice question. Here is our question class, here is the choice question class.

34
00:02:23,993 --> 00:02:28,088
Now have a close look and tell me, which methods does the choice question class

35
00:02:28,088 --> 00:02:32,858
inherit? Just give me the names of all those methods that choice question

36
00:02:32,858 --> 00:02:38,179
doesn't redefine, that it simply picks up from question. Which methods does

37
00:02:38,179 --> 00:02:42,543
choice question overrides? That is which method does choice question need to

38
00:02:42,543 --> 00:02:47,668
redefine because the one's from question are not satisfactory. And finally,

39
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:51,380
which method or methods does choice question add that weren't present in the

40
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:56,976
question class in the first place? Just give me the names of the methods, all

41
00:02:56,976 --> 00:03:00,024
together there are 5 of them.
