00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:04,130
So so far we have talked about a journal script of going to a restaurant, or

2
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:08,192
an abstract script for going to a restaurant. This is like a class. We can

3
00:00:08,192 --> 00:00:13,200
instantiate it. So let's do this same script instantiated with these values with

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,080
the greatest variables. So, Salwa is not a customer. Lucas is the waiter.

5
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:22,880
And so on. And this instantiation is an important aspect of intelligence. Let's

6
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:28,040
go back to our intelligent agent. It might be that Salwa is really a robot. Now,

7
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:31,980
how would a robot know what to do in a restaurant? How do we program a robot

8
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:36,400
in such a way that it would know what actions to take in a particular situation?

9
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:41,850
Well, suppose that, Salwa the robot, in its memory, had a number of scripts like

10
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:46,170
this one? And when it entered a restaurant, it invoked the restaurant script,

11
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:50,460
which told it exactly what kind of actions to take. We could also see how this

12
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:55,160
script allows Salwa, the robot, to generate expectations, to guess what will

13
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:59,870
happen even before it happens. There is one more thing worth noting here.

14
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:02,650
Notice how we are composing scripts of these primitive actions here,

15
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:05,770
the same primitive actions that occurred in the last lesson.

16
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:10,230
So, these primitive actions are now providing the fundamental units of

17
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:15,740
frames that compose together in some causally coherent sequence, make a script.

18
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:20,030
This brings up another point. Notice how some knowledge structures

19
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:24,330
are composed out of other knowledge structures. Earlier, we had frames for

20
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:27,540
these primitive actions, gave them social knowledge structures. Now,

21
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:30,860
we have scripts which are composed out of these framelike knowledge structures.
