1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Now we keep using the words get, keep, and grow, but this get, keep, and grow

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
actually refers to human beings not just random ideas.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
And one of the things we need to understand is what's the archetype

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
or the persona of our customers that we're actually wanting to get and so one of the things

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:24,000
that's kind of hard for startups is to realize that getting customers isn't some abstract idea--

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
you really need to understand who your customers are

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
and this is not just thinking about selling to consumers.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Even in corporations, there are human beings with titles that you need to figure out

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
almost the same things as you would in a consumer company.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
And so what you need to understand--what are the roles of these individuals you're trying to sell to.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Who are they? If its in a company, what's their position? What's their title?

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
What's their organization, and by the way not just on the org chart.

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
How do they get influenced to? Who do they influence?

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
And if there are actually buyers, how do they buy. I mean how do they hear of our products,

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
how do they know about you, and as we'll see later one of the interesting things is

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
there are some customers that are users like in Google--

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
There are people who use search, but there are people who are payers

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
who are actually a whole different customer segment.

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
You need to understand that these people--this archetype I'm trying to define

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
are they users or the payers, are they regulators, or they're somewhere else in the buying process.

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
And what you really are trying to understand, if you remember from the value proposition

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,000
and customer segment lectures, is you're trying to understand what pain is being solve for them

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
and what gain is your product creating for them, and if the core is you're trying

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
to derive an archetype of who they are and so what we tend to do is suggest there are startups that

25
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
you would literally start with a series of hypothesis and you get out of the building

26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
and in your customer discovery process, you're going to start refining archetypes.

27
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
It turns that most companies are selling to multiple archetypes.

28
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
If you have two or three, don't worry--that's probably fine.

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
If you have 20, it means you voted none of the above and you really need to refine it more,

30
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,000
but then we suggest the company is actually pick a representative picture of who that persona is--

31
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
who the person would most represent that archetype.

32
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Put together a poster and post it on the wall of your engineering department

33
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
and say, "Here's who you're building the product for"--it's they.

34
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,000
He might be a young urban professional, 21 to 30, lives in the large cities, buys x or y.

35
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Or it could be Sally, a Midwest mother of 45 to 55 in the MIdwest of the United States or

36
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
someone in India or China--it doesn't matter.

37
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
What you need to do is have an opinion based on some fact that gets refined.

38
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
It helps you understand these are the people we're trying to acquire

39
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
and don't angst about your first hypothesis,

40
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
but understand the whole goal of customer discovery is to continually to refine--

41
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
these are the people we think are most likely to buy in the early stages of our company.
