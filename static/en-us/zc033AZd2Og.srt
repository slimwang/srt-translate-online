00:00:00,058 --> 00:00:03,364
The answer--1,000 bins will probably be fastest.

2
00:00:03,364 --> 00:00:08,093
Since you're likely going to be limited by atomic performance, the histogram that offers the most bins is

3
00:00:08,093 --> 00:00:11,816
probably going to have the highest throughput--with a 1,000 bin histogram,

4
00:00:11,816 --> 00:00:16,556
1000 threads can be updating the histogram at any given time, whereas with a 10 bin

5
00:00:16,556 --> 00:00:22,218
or a 100 bin histogram, only 10 or 100 bins can actually update the histogram at any time.
