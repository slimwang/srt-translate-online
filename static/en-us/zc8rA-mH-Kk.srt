00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,550
Now that you've learned more
about your learning zones,

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:05,190
it's time to map your own journey.

3
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:07,900
Think about different skills
you've learned in the past, and

4
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:10,880
reflect on how you felt as
you were learning each skill.

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:17,990
It could be playing an instrument,
or a sport, or a new subject.

6
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:21,040
For me,
I've been dancing since I was young.

7
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:22,740
I was a dance major in college.

8
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:26,210
So I'm very comfortable and
familiar with dance.

9
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:28,220
So dance is in my safe zone.

10
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:31,830
When I graduated from
college I became a teacher,

11
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:33,900
which was something
I'd never done before.

12
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:35,930
I was definitely feeling stretched.

13
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:38,590
So teaching was in my stretch zone.

14
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:43,800
When I started learning how to program
it was totally unfamiliar territory.

15
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,120
And there are definitely moments
I was in my strain zone.

16
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:48,900
I was completely overwhelmed sometimes.

17
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:51,050
And I struggle to learn new concepts.

18
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:53,780
So programming was in my strain zone.

19
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,650
However over time with
the help of a community I

20
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:01,830
started to feel like programming
was more in my stretch zone.

21
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,250
Now it's your turn.

22
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:06,170
Chart your skills in
the learning zones below.

23
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:11,250
Write your current skills in the boxes
below for each learning zone.

24
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:14,810
They can be programming languages or
even different skills.

25
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:17,940
Remember there's no one correct answer.

26
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:20,810
Each person's journey into
the programming world will be different.
