00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:03,880
Now the coding solution is fantastic for a single file, but practical usage

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:08,023
fails. Once we want to load a suite of files, we effectively need to specify a

3
00:00:08,023 --> 00:00:12,592
callback for each one of them. Instead, we should add support to our asset

4
00:00:12,592 --> 00:00:16,875
manager to allow us to pass a list of files to load. And receive one callback

5
00:00:16,875 --> 00:00:20,705
once they've all been loaded. So what we'd like you to do, is modify the load

6
00:00:20,705 --> 00:00:25,550
assets function to taking a list of asset names in a single callback function.

7
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:29,232
Now just as a heads up, this process may be a little bit tricky. You'll

8
00:00:29,232 --> 00:00:31,920
probably want to do something right here in the onload function to keep track

9
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,104
of how many files have been loaded so far. Make note of it, so that you only

10
00:00:36,104 --> 00:00:40,715
have to issue one callback function. One other interesting aspect that you're

11
00:00:40,715 --> 00:00:43,724
going to have to change is what if all of the assets are loaded, or what if

12
00:00:43,724 --> 00:00:48,790
some sub-portion of them are loaded and other ones need to be loaded? In this

13
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:52,014
situation make sure you also take into account, what happens if half of the

14
00:00:52,014 --> 00:00:55,238
images are loaded, or none of the images are loaded, or all of the images are

15
00:00:55,238 --> 00:01:00,318
loaded? In these three different scenarios you should have a different logic

16
00:01:00,318 --> 00:01:04,634
path on when the callback function actually gets issued. So for example if all

17
00:01:04,634 --> 00:01:07,070
of the assets are loaded, you may only need to do one callback function

18
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:08,432
immediately.
