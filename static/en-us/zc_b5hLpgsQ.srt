I hope you took a few minutes to
look over the documentation for

2
00:00:03,305 --> 00:00:04,326
UIViewController.

3
00:00:04,326 --> 00:00:06,532
Don't worry if a bit of
it seems strange now.

4
00:00:06,532 --> 00:00:10,370
You will know this class inside and
out by the end of this course.

5
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:12,620
Here's a quick question
to test your knowledge.

6
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:16,801
Which one of these is called first in
the life cycle of our UIViewController,

7
00:00:16,801 --> 00:00:18,680
