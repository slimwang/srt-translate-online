00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:03,770
We'll teach you a lot about
the Gradle DSL in this class, but

2
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:06,830
you'll inevitably run into
use cases we haven't covered.

3
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:09,700
Fortunately, Gradle has fantastic
documentation that will allow

4
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:11,620
you to find the features you need.

5
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:13,910
In fact, let's get a little practice.

6
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:16,620
If you wanted to dynamically
decide at runtime whether or

7
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:21,120
not to run a task, to what method on the
task object would you pass a closure?

8
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,860
Write your answer in this box.

9
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:26,590
You can find a link to the Gradle DSL
reference in the instructor notes.

10
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:29,110
By the way, since we'll be back here
pretty often throughout the course,

11
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:32,209
this would be a good time to go ahead
and bookmark the Gradle DSL reference.
