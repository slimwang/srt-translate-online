00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The vital ingredient for stiffness is that the model includes to vary different time scales.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
That's not the case for this spacecraft and that's not the case for the 1D harmonic oscillator.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
But with the cloth simulation, we do have to vary different time scales.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Imagine this cloth to be composed of tons of tiny, tiny springs.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
This is actually how cloth simulation is being done.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
If you push the cloth in this direction, you're working against the stiff spring,

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
meaning you're working on a very small time scale.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
If you push the cloth up, you're rotating that spring, meaning you're working on a slow time scale.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
This is a very annoying problem for the simulation of pieces of clothing,

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
in video games, and for special effects in movies.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 99:59:59,999
You do not want to use time steps of microseconds for something that seems so simple.
