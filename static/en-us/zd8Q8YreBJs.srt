00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:05,469
You know Puff, it is so cool that we
were able to build an app in a weekend.

2
00:00:05,469 --> 00:00:06,538
>> Yeah, isn't it amazing?

3
00:00:06,538 --> 00:00:07,118
I told you, you could do it.

4
00:00:07,118 --> 00:00:07,753
>> It blows my mind.

5
00:00:07,753 --> 00:00:10,330
>> Yeah, now and that explains
through the power of Firebase.

6
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:10,612
>> Right.

7
00:00:10,612 --> 00:00:13,769
>> because it's really reused,
the real-time database.

8
00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:18,057
Firebase storage, authentication,
notifications, analytics, and

9
00:00:18,057 --> 00:00:19,379
we use remote config.

10
00:00:19,379 --> 00:00:21,161
And they all came from one source.

11
00:00:21,161 --> 00:00:23,673
So we didn't have to write any
surface head up codes, right?

12
00:00:23,673 --> 00:00:26,986
We really actually wrote surprisingly
little client-side code.

13
00:00:26,986 --> 00:00:29,092
>> I know, it's incredible and
like with all the database stuff,

14
00:00:29,092 --> 00:00:30,771
I don't have to fiddle
with foreign keys anymore.

15
00:00:30,771 --> 00:00:32,600
So I'm happy and I'm so happy,

16
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:35,439
I'm going to start planning
next weekend's app.

17
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:36,229
But between now and

18
00:00:36,229 --> 00:00:39,199
then with this really nice weather,
I'm going to go work on my tan.

19
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,679
>> Yeah, I can imagine that.

20
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:43,810
Well, thanks everyone for
joining us to learn about Firebase.

21
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:47,580
I hope this gives you a foundation that
you can start coming up with your own

22
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:49,619
app ideas using Firebase.

23
00:00:49,619 --> 00:00:51,699
But for more information and
inspiration,

24
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:56,884
check out the official Firebase
website on firebase.google.com.
