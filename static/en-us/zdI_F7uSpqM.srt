00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:06,640
I'm just going to give you guys a brief
overview of what Jasmine is and

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:10,190
how we are going to be
using it in our project.

3
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:13,084
So I'm going to be screen
sharing right now.

4
00:00:13,084 --> 00:00:13,940
>> Yep, there you go.
>> Okay,

5
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:18,470
as you can see I am in our
GitHub repo for feed reader.

6
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:22,792
So, whenever you go into,
you have this master branch where

7
00:00:22,792 --> 00:00:27,221
you have a bunch of different
folders index.html, readme.

8
00:00:27,221 --> 00:00:33,590
You go into Jasmine, and then you go
into spec where you see feedreader.js.

9
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:36,063
This is the file that you're going
to be writing your test soon in.

10
00:00:36,063 --> 00:00:37,015
>> Mm-hm.

11
00:00:37,015 --> 00:00:40,257
>> So, as you can see,
this file only has some stuff in it.

12
00:00:40,257 --> 00:00:43,550
So, it has a bunch of
documentation which is really good,

13
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:47,718
you guys have to go through it, since
all the tests that you will be writing

14
00:00:47,718 --> 00:00:50,025
are listed under To-Dos, right here.

15
00:00:50,025 --> 00:00:53,090
So let me just sort of, yeah.

16
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:54,110
Let me zoom into it.

17
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:56,290
Okay.
So you have all these To-Dos.

18
00:00:56,290 --> 00:01:00,965
So all these To-Dos are the tests
that you need to be writing.

19
00:01:00,965 --> 00:01:06,155
So about that, if you can see, there is
one little sort of code that is written.

20
00:01:06,155 --> 00:01:11,285
And it's actually written
using Jasmine documentation.

21
00:01:11,285 --> 00:01:16,535
So what they describe is
actually [INAUDIBLE] is it's

22
00:01:16,535 --> 00:01:21,780
defining a suite, and the name of
the suite is going to be RSS feeds.

23
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:26,400
So, this is going to be the start of
your test suite for RSS feeds for

24
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,813
testing RSS feeds.

25
00:01:27,813 --> 00:01:28,320
>> Mm-hm.

26
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,365
>> And then you have these

27
00:01:29,365 --> 00:01:30,355
documents in here,
>> [COUGH]

28
00:01:30,355 --> 00:01:32,153
>> That specifies this is our first

29
00:01:32,153 --> 00:01:36,147
test and a test to make sure that all
feeds variable have been defined and

30
00:01:36,147 --> 00:01:37,780
that it's not empty.

31
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:40,620
And you have to experiment
with this before you

32
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:42,390
get started with your project.

33
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:46,560
So what happens when you change allFeeds
and upload gs to be an empty area and

34
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,030
refresh the page?

35
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:52,486
As you can see, this is what Jonathan
was talking about in his last office

36
00:01:52,486 --> 00:01:53,360
hours-
>> Mm-hm.

37
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,580
>> Where he actually deleted
the allFeeds variable, made it empty and

38
00:01:57,580 --> 00:02:02,870
then he sort of tried running
this code and it failed.

39
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:07,452
So, what I'm going to do is,
the next part, line 24 is it,

40
00:02:07,452 --> 00:02:09,294
our defined function.

41
00:02:09,294 --> 00:02:14,790
So, what it is, is the it function
inside, is called a spec.

42
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:16,588
So, what is a spec?

43
00:02:16,588 --> 00:02:20,897
A spec is a JavaScript function
that says what some piece

44
00:02:20,897 --> 00:02:23,790
of your program should be doing.

45
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:28,240
So as you can see,
RSS feeds need to be defined.

46
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:32,340
That is essentially what you
have to do in this code.

47
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:35,940
And It is just a function that's
going to define your specs.

48
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:42,570
So, a test sweep can have a zillion
specs that define a zillion tests.

49
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:47,730
The next line when you go,
is the expect function.

50
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:50,190
So, what does the expect says?

51
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:54,845
So, the expect function acts on
the allFeeds variable and it says,

52
00:02:54,845 --> 00:03:00,400
toBeDefined, so
you need all the feeds inside

53
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,640
your JSON object to be defined and
the length should not be zero.

54
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:09,050
So as you can,
see this is fairly readable.

55
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:13,775
And if you want to explore all these
functionalities, the toBeDefined and

56
00:03:13,775 --> 00:03:17,300
toBeZero functionalities,
what you can do is you can go

57
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:22,026
back to the Jasmine folder, and
then go into the your Jasmine2.1.2.

58
00:03:22,026 --> 00:03:26,005
And when you open Jasmine.js,
what you can see is,

59
00:03:26,005 --> 00:03:29,190
I'm going to be searching toBeDefined.

60
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:31,701
So, as you can see,
there are four instances.

61
00:03:31,701 --> 00:03:35,872
So, the first one is actually
providing you a matchers, so,

62
00:03:35,872 --> 00:03:38,852
as you can see,
these are called matchers.

63
00:03:38,852 --> 00:03:41,222
So, whatever goes into your expect, and

64
00:03:41,222 --> 00:03:44,680
all these functions
are called your matchers.

65
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:50,150
So, you go down and you can see
that this is how the toBeDefined is

66
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:54,980
defined and
it's going to either return, I think,

67
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:59,930
a variable that is going to say,
no, is it true or is it false.

68
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:02,230
So that's what it's sort
of going to give you.

69
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:06,290
And you have a lot of other functions
called toBeFalse, toBeGreaterThan,

70
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:07,550
toBeLessThan.

71
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:11,910
You can make use of any of
these inside your test suite,

72
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:15,570
depending upon what sort of
tests you want to act on.

73
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:19,172
So yeah, that was a very quick and
short summary.

74
00:04:19,172 --> 00:04:24,070
But if you have more questions on p6,
feel free to post on the forums.

75
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:27,900
And I'm sure your peers or the
instructors will be glad to help you.
