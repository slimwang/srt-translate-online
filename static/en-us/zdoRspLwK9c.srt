00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:04,874
So, now this is something we should recognize. We have a quadratic equation on

2
00:00:04,874 --> 00:00:08,876
the right side, and 0 on the left side. So let's see if you can solve this

3
00:00:08,876 --> 00:00:13,124
quadratic equation. When you think you have the answers, enter them here and

4
00:00:13,124 --> 00:00:15,179
write your answer as a set.
