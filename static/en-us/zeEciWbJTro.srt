00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:03,404
For these four examples, we were able to complete the square and turn each

2
00:00:03,404 --> 00:00:08,295
expression into a perfect square by adding a certain amount. The amount that we

3
00:00:08,295 --> 00:00:13,020
added in each case depended upon the b coefficient for the x term. In the first

4
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:17,150
example, the b term was a 6 and we ended up having to add 9 to make a perfect

5
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:23,282
square. In the second example, our b was 12 and we ended up adding 36 pieces to

6
00:00:23,282 --> 00:00:29,513
get a perfect square. In this third case, b was negative 4 and we added four

7
00:00:29,513 --> 00:00:36,354
pieces. And in the last case, b was negative 10 and we added 25. So, for any

8
00:00:36,354 --> 00:00:39,546
value of b, how much do you think we need to add in order to complete the

9
00:00:39,546 --> 00:00:44,025
square? In other words, see if you can look and find a pattern between these

10
00:00:44,025 --> 00:00:49,947
two numbers. How do we go from this b to the added amount? Now, you might think

11
00:00:49,947 --> 00:00:54,038
the answer would be b plus 3, but we know that can't be correct. Sure, if we

12
00:00:54,038 --> 00:01:00,280
add 3 here, we get 9. But if I added 3 to 12, I would get 15 and not 36. So,

13
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:03,940
what expression could we write here that uses the letter b and gives us the

14
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:08,927
appropriate value? The expression should work for each of the four cases. And

15
00:01:08,927 --> 00:01:12,788
be sure to take some time to think about it. This one's tough. If you get

16
00:01:12,788 --> 00:01:15,580
stuck, look for a hint in the instructor's comment.
