00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:05,120
Now our goal is to send a text message using code, and I know of a Python

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:08,530
package that does exactly that. It's called twilio.

3
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:10,570
And I am going to place twilio on the board.

4
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:16,050
Twilio does not come with the Python Standard Library,

5
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:18,060
which is why I have kept it outside of

6
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:21,180
the yellow background. Twilio is one of the thousands

7
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:23,840
of external Python packages that are available for you

8
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,910
to download and use, and there is a link

9
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:27,850
in the instructor notes that points out some of

10
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:31,300
the more popular external Python packages. For now what

11
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:34,260
we are going to do, is being by downloading twilio.
