00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:05,978
Our polynomial is in the form ax squared plus bx plus c. We multiply the a and c

2
00:00:05,978 --> 00:00:11,270
together to get 12. This is the top number. This number will always come from

3
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:15,892
the product of the coefficient of the x squared term and our constant. The b or

4
00:00:15,892 --> 00:00:21,730
the bottom number comes from our x term, the 13. Great work if you put 12 and

5
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:22,067
13.
