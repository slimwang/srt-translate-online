1
00:00:00,552 --> 00:00:03,730
All right, now lets do something
that is a little bit magical.

2
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:06,880
Without changing any code at all,
we're going to run the exact

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:09,630
same game we just ran on our desktop,
but on an android device.

4
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:13,629
If you've worked through our mini
course on installing android studio,

5
00:00:13,629 --> 00:00:17,060
then you should already have installed
a hello world app on your phone.

6
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:19,950
And if you haven't done that yet, then
follow the link in the instructor notes

7
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:22,895
to learn how to set up your phone for
USB debugging.

8
00:00:22,895 --> 00:00:25,320
Allright, so I've got my test device.

9
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,760
And we'll go ahead and plug that in.

10
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:31,982
There we go, this little icon says
that we're now doing USB debugging.

11
00:00:31,982 --> 00:00:35,550
All right, now we'll switch our run
configuration from the desktop run

12
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:38,870
configuration back to the android
run configuration, and hit run.

13
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:42,240
When this device picker dialog pops up,

14
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:45,210
we want to select the actual test
device we want to use and hit okay.

15
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:49,540
And there we go,
we've got our game running on our phone.

16
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:51,639
Check it out,
it even does multi touch tracking.

17
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:56,130
Now it's time for you to try running
the Android version of the app.

18
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:57,860
Set up your phone for USB debugging.

19
00:00:57,860 --> 00:00:58,800
If you haven't done that yet

20
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,650
you can check out the instructions
in the instructor notes.

21
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:04,060
Change the run configuration
back to Android.

22
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:05,190
Hit the green arrow.

23
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:07,390
Select your phone and
in the device choose your dialog.

24
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:09,370
And then you just get to poke
at your phone for a while.
