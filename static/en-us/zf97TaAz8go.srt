1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:04,689
So we're looking for the bandwidth-delay
product of the Earth-Moon network link.

2
00:00:04,689 --> 00:00:08,310
In other words, at any moment, how much
data is in the pipe having been sent by

3
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:11,006
the earth endpoint but not yet
received at the moon endpoint?

4
00:00:11,006 --> 00:00:16,590
Okay, so
it's 384,000 kilometers to the moon,

5
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:21,471
and in one second our laser signal
travels 300,000 kilometers,

6
00:00:21,471 --> 00:00:24,360
and we're sending at a rate
of 1 gigabit per second.

7
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:28,730
Doing a little bit of algebra here, the
kilometers cancel, the seconds cancel,

8
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:33,674
and we end up with a value in
gigabits that's 384,000 divided by

9
00:00:33,674 --> 00:00:36,830
300,000 and
that works out to 1.28 Gigabits.

10
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:40,350
That's the amount of
data that's floating

11
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:41,500
in between the earth and the moon.
