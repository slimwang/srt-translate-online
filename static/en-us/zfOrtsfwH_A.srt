00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,580
Now, let's do a quiz on
the overall cache behavior.

2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:07,970
Let's assume we have a cache
that is only 256 bytes in size,

3
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:14,790
with a 32-byte line size, two way set
associative, write back, write allocate.

4
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:18,090
Let's say that the processor is
generating 32-bit addresses and

5
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:22,120
that the bits of the address
are numbered 0 through 31.

6
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:27,689
So the question for you is the tag
bits are bit what through what?

7
00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:31,100
The index bits in the address
are what through what?

8
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:33,540
And the offset bits are which
bit through which bit?
