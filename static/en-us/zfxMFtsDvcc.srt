1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
And the answer is 7.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
If you look at this for 1, 2, 3, all the way to 6,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
you won't be able to guarantee a negative class.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 99:59:59,999
You have to include the final point over here. That is the minimum.
