Hello, and welcome to this unit on file systems. We'll talk about

2
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:08,300
what a file system is, about how application developers interact with it,

3
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:10,890
and then see what an OS is doing behind the scenes and

4
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:13,010
discuss some common optimizations that make

5
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:15,460
file systems faster. I hope you enjoy.
