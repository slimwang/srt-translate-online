00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,830
The social readjustment rating scale looked at different types of life events

2
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:08,558
that could be considered stressers. Each event could be scored on a range from

3
00:00:08,558 --> 00:00:13,763
10 to 100, depending on how stressful it was. At the top of the list, we see

4
00:00:13,763 --> 00:00:17,938
death of a spouse being the most stressful life event. At the bottom of the

5
00:00:17,938 --> 00:00:23,354
list with a rating of 11, we see really minor legal violations. And with a

6
00:00:23,354 --> 00:00:27,663
rating of 12 there's Christmas. So. here we see that holidays are even on the

7
00:00:27,663 --> 00:00:32,400
scale of stressful life events, although they aren't necessarily bad things.

8
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,607
So, this shows that even positive things can be stressful. Have you ever the

9
00:00:35,607 --> 00:00:40,280
phrase, I need a vacation from my vacation? That's just another example to show

10
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:44,504
that stress is not just associated with uncomfortable or unwanted things like

11
00:00:44,504 --> 00:00:49,920
divorce or death of a spouse. It's also associated what what we consider to be

12
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,460
positive or fun events, like vacations or holidays.
