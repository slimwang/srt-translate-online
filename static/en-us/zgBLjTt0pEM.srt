1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,500
So, what was interesting was number 1, shared economics.

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:06,330
Well, that was right. You both have an economic reason to want a partner.

3
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:07,330
But you know what?

4
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:10,140
Number 2 is right as well, economies of scale.

5
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:12,470
You partnering with a much larger company

6
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:15,160
means you could take advantage of their supply chain

7
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:18,890
or their volume discounts or the massive sales force they have.

8
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:21,070
But you know, number 3 is right as well.

9
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:23,840
Large companies, just by definition because they're larger,

10
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,550
have more of everything than you do.

11
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:28,170
Wouldn't it be great if you could get your hands on some of it somehow?

12
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:31,510
And number 4. Access to customers.

13
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:34,260
Well, we have 3 million customers, and today you have 3.

14
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:36,580
That's a good idea too.

15
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:39,560
Finally, access to their marketing or their brand.

16
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:42,430
Wouldn't it be great to have the General Electric label

17
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:47,630
or the Intel label or be a Facebook partner next to yours?

18
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:50,630
And so the answer is: they all apply.
