00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,100
In the previous video, you learned
that virtually every device that

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:06,180
communicates across the Internet
has a physical layer, and

3
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:09,370
these intermediate communication
protocol layers that sit on top of it,

4
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:12,400
in order to enable the transmission
of packets and data streams.

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,650
Sitting on top of these layers
is the application layer.

6
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:16,870
This layer is responsible for

7
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:20,620
setting all of the protocols in
which applications exchange data.

8
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:22,830
The most popular
application level protocol

9
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:26,570
is the Hypertext Transfer Protocol,
or HTTP.

10
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:30,600
HTTP functions via a series of requests
and responses between clients and

11
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,490
servers respectively.

12
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:39,180
You may be familiar with other
acronyms like FTP, IMAP, SSH, and POP.

13
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:42,790
These are also some other popular
application level protocols.

14
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:46,410
The original OSI model has the
application layer sitting as the highest

15
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:49,720
level set of protocols for
communicating across the Internet.

16
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:51,820
But other protocols and
technologies for sending and

17
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:54,360
receiving information
via APIs also exist.

18
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,150
In order to better understand and
organize these technologies,

19
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:02,240
I would like to introduce two more
layers to our existing model.

20
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:05,700
Let's call these two layers the web
service and message formatting layers.
