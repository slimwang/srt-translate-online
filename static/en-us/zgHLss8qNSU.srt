00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,950
Say we have a prior of a Gaussian with a mean mu and covariance sigma squared,

2
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:12,950
and our measurement has exactly the same mean and same covariance.

3
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:18,450
Suppose we multiply both and get a new mean, which is the same as the old mean,

4
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:23,000
and we get a new covarience, sigma squared,

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
which as you all know, corresponds to a more peaked Gaussian.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,750
I want you to express nu squared as a multiple of sigma squared.

7
00:00:32,750 --> 99:59:59,999
Just put the answer here as a real number.
