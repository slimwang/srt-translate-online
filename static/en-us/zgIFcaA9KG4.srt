1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,771
The International Classification
of Disease is the oldest data

2
00:00:04,771 --> 00:00:07,783
standard dating back to the 1800s.

3
00:00:07,783 --> 00:00:11,947
And in a sense, even to earlier
centuries when researchers first became

4
00:00:11,947 --> 00:00:15,500
interested in the causes
of human mortality.

5
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:19,379
Traditionally, it's been a list or
classification of medical diagnoses.

6
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:25,740
It's maintained by the World Health
Organization, and is updated every ten

7
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:31,490
years, with the latest version being
ICD-10, which was adopted in 1994.

8
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:34,773
Here in the US, where still using ICD-9,

9
00:00:34,773 --> 00:00:38,715
even though most other countries,
are using 10.

10
00:00:38,715 --> 00:00:46,700
ICD-10 is a major expansion capable of
representing many more clinical details.

11
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:50,460
We can see that, here, by comparing
the coding systems' capabilities for

12
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:51,280
breast cancer.

13
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:57,319
In ICD-9, we know what portion
of the breast is involved.

14
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,610
The central portion, here, but
we don't know which breast.

15
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:08,100
In ICD-10, we not only know which
portion of the breast is involved,

16
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:11,068
but we know whether it's the right or
the left breast.

17
00:01:11,068 --> 00:01:17,460
So in ICD-10, laterality is represented,
which greatly increases the number

18
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:21,632
of codes, which is a big part of the
objections to using it here in the U.S..

19
00:01:21,632 --> 00:01:26,140
In fact, ICD-10 really becomes
an ontology capable of

20
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:28,900
representing clinical relationships.

21
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:33,925
Here, we can see that
the patient has gout, affecting

22
00:01:33,925 --> 00:01:38,180
their left shoulder.

23
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:43,020
But they have not yet
developed a uric acid deposit,

24
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:46,360
called a tophus, in that shoulder.

25
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:51,300
We can also see that the etiology,
or the reason for

26
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:53,978
their gout, is kidney failure.

27
00:01:53,978 --> 00:02:01,120
The current U.S. target date for
ICD-10 adoption is October 1st, 2015.

28
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:04,510
But given how close we are to ICD-11,

29
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:08,639
there are some proposals
to skip ICD-10 entirely.
