1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,500
The app you will build will let us record our voice and

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:06,930
will also let us add different effects to it.

3
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:09,510
Although, to make things easy in this lesson,

4
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:11,590
we will start with the version 1 of our app.

5
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:15,760
In this version we will not record any audio.

6
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:20,920
Except that we will play a famous movie quote.

7
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:25,120
>> My momma always said, life was like a box of chocolates.

8
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:26,630
>> Let's make this app.

9
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:30,240
Before we start writing code however, let's think for a moment

10
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,660
about all the steps we will need to do to make this version one of our app.

11
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:37,880
I can already tell you that we will need to figure out how to

12
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:39,560
add buttons to our app.

13
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:42,450
We will also need to figure out how to transition between two different

14
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:44,200
screens on our app.

15
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,790
So it seems like we will need to answer a lot of,

16
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:50,490
how would you do blank in Swift type questions.

17
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:53,070
Here is your chance to expand on this list.

18
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:56,120
And think a little bit more deeply about what are some of the other things you

19
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,790
will need to do to make this app.

20
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:02,710
You should know that one thing experts in Swift do really well is that they

21
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:06,100
will take a large problem like making an app.

22
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:09,520
And then they will come up with a bunch of smaller tasks.

23
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,060
So see if you can come up with eight or

24
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:15,380
more things that you will need to learn do in Swift to complete this app.
