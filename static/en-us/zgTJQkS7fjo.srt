00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,510
A little while ago, you started
this course by grabbing x code, and

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:06,310
learning a little bit about
the swift programming language.

3
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:09,970
In lesson two, you created the first
part of the pitch perfect app.

4
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:15,035
Added labels and buttons, and wired
them up to code in your view controller.

5
00:00:15,035 --> 00:00:18,905
You even took some time to learn about
the model view controller pattern.

6
00:00:18,905 --> 00:00:22,765
In this lesson we're going to learn
how to play audio from the app and

7
00:00:22,765 --> 00:00:26,385
navigate between two
screens in the iOS app.

8
00:00:26,385 --> 00:00:27,005
Let's get started.
