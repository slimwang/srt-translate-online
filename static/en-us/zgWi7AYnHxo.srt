1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:04,019
So far, we have seen how to add and
subtract vectors, and

2
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:06,930
we have seen how to multiply
vectors by scalars.

3
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:10,560
This might lead you to ask,
can we multiply two vectors?

4
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:13,250
It turns out that there are several
different notions of vector

5
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:14,550
multiplication.

6
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:18,520
Perhaps the first one we might think of,
just multiplying corresponding

7
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:22,690
coordinates, doesn't turn out to
be useful in many applications.

8
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:27,060
However, there are other notions of
multiplication, which are very useful.

9
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:30,870
One of the most important operations
we can perform on vectors is

10
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:34,920
the inner product, also called the dot
product, since we often represent

11
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:38,400
it by placing a dot between
the vectors being multiplied.

12
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,850
It's important stems from its
geometric interpretation.

13
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:45,750
It lets us find the angle
between two different vectors.

14
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:49,230
More precisely,
the inner product of the vectors, v and

15
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:53,018
w, in Euclidean space,
satisfies the following identity,

16
00:00:53,018 --> 00:00:59,090
v dot w equals the magnitude
of v times the magnitude of w,

17
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:03,990
times the cosine of theta, where theta
is the angle between the vectors, v and

18
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:07,610
w, if we were to draw them
emanating from the same point.

19
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:12,230
Technically, there are two angles
between the vectors, a shorter one and

20
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:13,520
a longer one.

21
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,550
We always use the shorter
one by convention.

22
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:21,410
Note that the inner product of two
vectors is a number, not a vector.

23
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:23,790
Using the inverse of
the cosine function,

24
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:28,260
also called the arc cosine function,
we can solve for this angle.

25
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:32,854
It equals the arc cosine of
the dot product of v and w,

26
00:01:32,854 --> 00:01:37,357
divided by the product of
the magnitudes of v and w.

27
00:01:37,357 --> 00:01:40,987
Another way we can think of this
formula is as the following.

28
00:01:40,987 --> 00:01:48,198
The arc cosine of the normalization of
v dotted with the normalization of w.

29
00:01:48,198 --> 00:01:52,055
Of course, unless we have a nicer way
of computing the dot product of two

30
00:01:52,055 --> 00:01:54,771
vectors, this formula
doesn't do us much good.

31
00:01:54,771 --> 00:01:58,523
It turns out that there is a nicer
way to compute the inner product,

32
00:01:58,523 --> 00:02:03,090
and it is similar to our first candidate
notion for multiplying vectors.

33
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:08,720
To compute v dot w, we can multiply
the corresponding components of v and

34
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,520
w, and
then we can add those products together.

35
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:17,830
So, for example,
the dot product of the vectors 1,

36
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:22,790
2, -1 and 3, 1, 0 is 1 times 3,

37
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:27,780
plus 2 times 1, plus -1 times 0,
which equals 5.

38
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:34,010
This means that the angle between these
two vectors is the dot product of v and

39
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:38,970
w, which is 5,
divided by the magnitude of v, which is

40
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:44,250
the square root of 6, and the magnitude
of w, which is the square root of 10.

41
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:49,270
This gives about 0.87 radians,
which is about 50 degrees.

42
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:52,750
There are some interesting consequences
of this connection between the inner

43
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:55,590
product of two vectors and their angle.

44
00:02:55,590 --> 00:03:00,412
First, recall that the cosine
of x is always bounded

45
00:03:00,412 --> 00:03:05,022
below by -1 and above by 1,
no matter what x is.

46
00:03:05,022 --> 00:03:09,090
Using the earlier equation,
that the dot product of v and

47
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:13,158
w is the product of the magnitudes
times cosine of theta,

48
00:03:13,158 --> 00:03:18,074
we see that the dot product is bounded
below by negative magnitude of v

49
00:03:18,074 --> 00:03:23,930
times magnitude of w, and above by
magnitude of v times magnitude of w.

50
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:28,960
We can express this inequality more
succinctly as the absolute value of v

51
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:34,790
dot w is less than or equal to the
product of the magnitudes of v and w.

52
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:38,180
This is a famous inequality called
the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality,

53
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:42,120
and you will see this inequality
pop up all over linear algebra and

54
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,900
mathematics, in general.

55
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:48,740
Let's assume, for the moment,
that neither v nor w is the zero vector,

56
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:51,910
which would mean that their dot
product is automatically zero.

57
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:56,660
What does it mean if v dot w
actually equals the magnitude of v

58
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:58,720
times the magnitude of w?

59
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:03,680
From our earlier equation, it means
that the cosine of theta equals 1,

60
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:09,030
and this tells us that theta must equal
0 in both degrees and in radians.

61
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:13,395
In other words, the vectors, v and w,
are pointing in the same direction.

62
00:04:13,395 --> 00:04:18,930
Similarly, if v dot w equals
the negative of the product

63
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:24,620
of the magnitudes, we can conclude
that cosine of theta equals -1,

64
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:29,820
which means that theta equals
pi radians, or 180 degrees.

65
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:34,710
And that, in turn, means that v and
w are pointing in opposite directions.

66
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:40,840
Finally, if v dot w equals 0, then,
since we assumed that neither v nor

67
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:46,460
w was the zero vector, this means
that cosine of theta must equal 0.

68
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:51,520
This means that theta equals pi
over 2 radians, or 90 degrees.

69
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,380
So, v and
w are at a right angle to each other.

70
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:59,290
One last thing to consider is what
happens when you take the dot product

71
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:01,300
of a vector with itself.

72
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:05,430
In this case, the angle between
the two vectors is 0, both radians and

73
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:09,170
degrees, so,
cosine of theta will equal 1.

74
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:15,860
So our formula reduces to v dot v
equals the magnitude of v squared.

75
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:17,800
After a little rearrangement,

76
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:23,130
we can see that the magnitude of v
equals the square root of v dot v.

77
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:26,550
This gives us another interpretation
of the magnitude of a vector,

78
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:28,650
this time in terms of its dot product.
