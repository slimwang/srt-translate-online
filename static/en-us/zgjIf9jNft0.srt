00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:02,699
Here are two possible answers.

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:06,390
This region is bordering a green
region and an orange region, so

3
00:00:06,389 --> 00:00:09,109
it only has two options for colors.

4
00:00:09,109 --> 00:00:10,759
Compared to all our other regions,

5
00:00:10,759 --> 00:00:14,074
this is the minimum remaining
values of those regions.

6
00:00:14,074 --> 00:00:17,644
For this region, we can pick the least
constraining value, which is green in

7
00:00:17,644 --> 00:00:22,094
this case, because it's bordering region
can only take light blue or dark blue.

8
00:00:22,094 --> 00:00:25,394
So avoiding those two choices,
gives us more options later on.
