00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:04,420
So, before going any further,
think about what we've done thus far.

2
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:07,250
We've set everything up in our
environment to give us location

3
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:08,340
services.

4
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:11,850
And in our main activity,
we've created a connection to them and

5
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:15,600
instructed the API to call back to
this activity when it connects,

6
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,600
as well as when the connection fails.

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,140
We don't yet
have enough code to run the application.

8
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:23,630
There are several overrides
that we have to add

9
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:26,100
because of the interfaces we specified.

10
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:27,330
Let's take a look at these next.
