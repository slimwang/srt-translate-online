00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:04,570
In the last two lessons, we focused on motion problems that involve rates. The

2
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:08,506
rates were miles per hour, which is how fact an object was traveling. In this

3
00:00:08,506 --> 00:00:13,084
lesson, we're going to focus on a different kind of rate involving work. If it

4
00:00:13,084 --> 00:00:16,360
takes you two hours to complete a homework assignment, what fraction of the

5
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:20,922
assignment can you complete in one hour? In this case, we're talking about the

6
00:00:20,922 --> 00:00:25,620
rate, about how fast you can work on an assignment. When you think you know the

7
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:27,590
answer, enter that fraction here.
