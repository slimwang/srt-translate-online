1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:02,490
We can actually create a chart straight from the report.

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:03,490
>> Okay.

3
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:06,850
>> not all chart types are accounted for in the report

4
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:09,410
itself, but what's great about creating a chart directly from the report

5
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:12,320
is if you put it in multiple dashboards, it can have a

6
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,680
uniform way of showing all that data across all those different dashboards.

7
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:16,500
>> Makes sense.

8
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:20,140
>> So, if we click Customize and go back into the report.

9
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:22,800
We can add a chart type straight to our report right here.

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,630
>> Oh, nice.

11
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:25,730
>> And

12
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:27,620
so, what do you think? Bar chart? That

13
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:29,170
probably sounds like it makes the most sense.

14
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:30,460
>> Bar chart makes sense, yeah.

15
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:32,900
>> So, on the X-Axis.

16
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:34,620
>> I want to, I want to vertical of a bar chart.

17
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:34,912
>> Okay.

18
00:00:34,912 --> 00:00:38,887
>> So X-Axis I want to be Purchase Date, yeah, and Y-Axis I want

19
00:00:38,887 --> 00:00:44,470
Total Spent, yes. And so, click this Group By field here. And we probably want.

20
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:48,420
>> Ticket type? Oh, cool. Okay, that's very cool.

21
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:50,760
>> But, what's really great, is we

22
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,410
can also change how it looks. So maybe if

23
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:54,120
you wanted to stack them, so they're in one.

24
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:54,754
>> Uh-huh.

25
00:00:54,754 --> 00:00:55,390
>> Versus the other.

26
00:00:55,390 --> 00:01:00,710
>> Oh, nice. Yeah, sure, let's stack em. So, really quick, let's

27
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:03,510
just look at formatting, and see if there's anything we want to change there.

28
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:05,600
>> I give it a title.

29
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,354
>> We also probably want to enable the Hovers. So

30
00:01:08,354 --> 00:01:11,310
that when we hover over any part of the chart.

31
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:11,500
>> Yeah.

32
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:14,260
>> We actually see how much was spent for any individual.

33
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:14,590
>> Cool.

34
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:17,210
>> Hit OK. Awesome.

35
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:20,090
So there's our little preview right there based off of the preview data.

36
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:20,864
>> Uh-huh.

37
00:01:20,864 --> 00:01:23,760
>> But if we now Save and then Run Report,

38
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:28,780
then we can create another dashboard component off of this.

39
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,050
>> Wow, that is awesome! So looks like in June we were

40
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:35,760
selling a lot of tickets. Actually in June, June was interesting, because

41
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:38,030
not only did we sell a lot of tickets, we sold about

42
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:43,470
the same as in July, for general admission, but VIP's were crazy.

43
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:45,440
>> There must have been a special or something.

44
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,350
>> Or maybe just the people who are

45
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:48,795
really into the festival, like buy early or something.

46
00:01:48,795 --> 00:01:49,870
>> Yeah. They, they get to be VIPs.

47
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:50,040
>> Yeah.

48
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,810
>> Alright, that's pretty cool. So now I can, I'm guessing

49
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:55,340
I can figure out how to add this to the dashboard.

50
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:56,610
>> Well, yeah.

51
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:57,260
>> I think.

52
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:57,650
>> Try it out.

53
00:01:57,650 --> 00:01:59,985
>> Alright. You already saved it

54
00:01:59,985 --> 00:02:00,730
[LAUGH].

55
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:03,920
>> Kay, so saving was not the right idea there. But

56
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,760
I'm so terrified of messing up that I like saving a lot.

57
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:06,760
>>

58
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,830
[LAUGH].

59
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:11,930
Okay, dashboard. going to have to Edit. Alright, so,

60
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:14,467
I want to make my bar chart. I'm going to

61
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:18,910
drag this over. Not sure if I need to do that. My Data Source is total

62
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:22,670
revenue by month. Okay, that gave me a

63
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:25,600
graph but, this doesn't have the, like the

64
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,440
blue and the green sections. That's, that's making

65
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:32,030
me sad. Should I, what should I do? Help.

66
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:32,950
>> Little wrench.

67
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:34,760
>> Little wrench. Always little wrench. Little

68
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:37,420
wrench is such a, a good tool. Okay

69
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:39,974
>> So if you notice that little check box in the upper-left.

70
00:02:39,974 --> 00:02:43,890
>> Use chart as defined, that makes sense. Okay, so I used the

71
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:48,070
chart that I made in the report, and it gave me my favorite thing.

72
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:48,070
>>

73
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:49,320
[LAUGH]

74
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,440
>> Very cool.

75
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:54,220
>> Maybe we should edit the title and then Save and Run this dashboard again?

76
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:56,660
>> Sure. How do I run a dashboard?

77
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:58,620
>> click Close. Yep.

78
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:00,450
>> Save and Close?

79
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:01,320
>> Yep

80
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,450
>> So this is not what a user would see, what we were just looking at?

81
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:03,590
>> Right.

82
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:04,040
>> That was the art

83
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:04,450
>> That was the editor.

84
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:05,070
>> This is what a user would see.

85
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:06,430
>> Yeah, this is what a user would see.

86
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:09,020
>> This is a little prettier. Alright, this is very cool. So we

87
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:14,670
can track Revenue by Month. We can track Total Festival Revenue, and. What do

88
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:15,000
you think?

89
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,190
>> It looks really good.

90
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:16,420
>> Yeah.

91
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:18,300
>> but I don't know if a bar chart

92
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:21,510
would of been the best way to display that data.

93
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:22,870
Like, can you think of another type of chart

94
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:24,230
that we could have used that might of been better?
