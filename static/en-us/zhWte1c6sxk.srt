1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,540
Mathematical morphology has this huge
science behind it that's a very abstract

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:07,310
algebra because in some sense,
it's all about set theory.

3
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:08,060
Right?
I mean, basically,

4
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:08,700
that's what you're doing.

5
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:12,120
You've got these binary sets, and then
you do these operations on sets, and

6
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:14,320
then there's gray level morphology.

7
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:18,830
You won't find much of it in
the computer vision literature anymore.

8
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:19,940
When I say computer vision,

9
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:23,150
I mean conferences that use the word
computer vision in their title,

10
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:25,900
like computer vision pattern
recognition, European conference on

11
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:28,340
computer vision, the international
conference on computer vision.

12
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:31,340
You won't find a lot of things,
people doing work on morphology.

13
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:34,670
But if you go to certain, pattern
analysis kinds of things where they're

14
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:39,690
doing syntactic operations, you'll still
find mathematics of that, being done.

15
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:43,240
However, even though it doesn't appear
in this computer vision research,

16
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:44,970
we use it all the time.

17
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:46,760
Because we use it to
clean up our results.

18
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:50,460
In order to be able to get those great
results that we can brag about to our

19
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:54,200
our, our colleagues, or

20
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:59,126
to get paid by industrial folks to
build systems that actually work.

21
00:00:59,126 --> 00:01:03,555
So I think of think of this as not sexy,
but very important.

22
00:01:03,555 --> 00:01:07,805
I had a whole bunch of jokes to follow
that and I couldn't use any of them.

23
00:01:07,805 --> 00:01:10,975
So I'll just say that,
it's kind like me.

24
00:01:12,165 --> 00:01:13,385
All right.

25
00:01:13,385 --> 00:01:13,885
Talk to you later.
