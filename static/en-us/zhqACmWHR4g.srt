00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,940
My very first job in the game
industry was porting a popular PC

2
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:06,380
flight simulator to the Amiga computer.

3
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:06,980
This was ages ago.

4
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:09,590
There was a steep learning curve.

5
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:12,044
I'd been programming for
maybe ten years,

6
00:00:12,044 --> 00:00:14,590
since junior high school by this time.

7
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:17,270
But this was my first real
professional programming experience.

8
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:21,640
I was learning about 93 new
things every single day.

9
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:25,430
And there were new tools to understand
and libraries and systems to integrate.

10
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:28,810
Hardware issues and near faces,
not to mention the game itself.

11
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:31,920
It had been written for a completely
different computer architecture

12
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,520
by some super smart industry vets
including one of the company founders.

13
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:39,810
Oh, and did I mention, I didn't know
anything about flight simulators?

14
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:43,010
Well, I remember one of
the first issues I ran into.

15
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:45,970
There's a problem with the 3D renderer.

16
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:47,520
On a PC, it worked great.

17
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,120
It was pretty much bulletproof,
super fast.

18
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:52,060
It had been used in several titles and

19
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:54,080
it just kept getting better
as it was refined over time.

20
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:56,320
On the Amiga, though,

21
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,930
the renderer was brand new,
never been used in production.

22
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:01,270
And, there was a glitch.

23
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:05,820
Sometimes, unpredictably, a polygon
would tear and it would just blow up and

24
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:07,590
overwrite half a screen.

25
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:08,910
Looked terrible.

26
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:12,520
And since I hadn't written the code and
had no idea how our 3D engine worked,

27
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,640
I wasn't sure how to debug it.

28
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:19,510
I turned to one of those super smart
industry vets, one of the creators 3D

29
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:23,230
engine in fact, and asked him for
advice on tracking down this bug.

30
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:26,259
And he said,
I would just step through all the code.

31
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:30,030
Well, from my point of view,
this was insane.

32
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:32,230
I just didn't see how I
could possibly learn and

33
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:35,620
understand how the system
worked from top to bottom,

34
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:38,520
which is essentially what he
was telling me I needed to do.

35
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,310
To step through the system and
figure out which part wasn't working,

36
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:44,820
I had to know what each and
every part did when it was working.

37
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:48,480
He was right though, and it was hard.

38
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:51,340
But I learned more than just
how that 3D engine worked.

39
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:54,230
I learned that I could tackle
a really hard problem and solve it.

40
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,070
You can always look for the easy answer,

41
00:01:57,070 --> 00:02:00,810
but it's important that you not
give up if there isn't one.

42
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:03,780
You have what it takes to succeed, even
if it doesn't seem like it at first.
