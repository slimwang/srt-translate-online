1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,300
So lets look at the example history based projector that

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:06,746
has a 1-bit history with 2-bit counters, for each history. So

3
00:00:06,746 --> 00:00:09,896
the general approach to this branch vector stays the same,

4
00:00:09,896 --> 00:00:12,227
we take some bits of the PC, we index into the

5
00:00:12,227 --> 00:00:15,566
branch history table, but instead of having a 1-bit counter

6
00:00:15,566 --> 00:00:18,640
or a 2-bit counter in each entry. Now we have a

7
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,906
single bit history in each entry, a two bit counter for

8
00:00:21,906 --> 00:00:25,243
when the history is 0, and the separate two bit counter

9
00:00:25,243 --> 00:00:29,910
for when the history is 1. So the state of the predictor is now not just

10
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:32,220
the state of a single 1-bit or 2-bit

11
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:35,090
counter, it's the state of a single bit history

12
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:38,200
and two of these counters. So now let's

13
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:42,050
look at the behavior of predictors over time,

14
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:45,480
like this. We have the predictors state, the

15
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:50,220
prediction, the outcome, and whether the prediction was correct.

16
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:52,989
Let's start the predictor in a state where the

17
00:00:52,989 --> 00:00:55,971
history bit is and the 2, 2-bit predictors are

18
00:00:55,971 --> 00:00:59,030
both in the strong not taken state. So again

19
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,660
all three of these together are now the state of

20
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:04,819
the predictor. The prediction in this type of predictor

21
00:01:04,819 --> 00:01:07,960
is formed by using the history bit to tell

22
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:12,237
us which of the two predictor to use. Because

23
00:01:12,237 --> 00:01:15,234
the history is 0, we will be using the first

24
00:01:15,234 --> 00:01:18,520
of the two counters. It's saying strong not

25
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:21,880
taken, so the prediction will be not taken.

26
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:24,236
Let's say that this is a branch where

27
00:01:24,236 --> 00:01:27,200
the outcome is taken, not taken, taken, not

28
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,708
taken, et cetera, and in this case the

29
00:01:29,708 --> 00:01:33,810
prediction and the outcome differ. So, we have

30
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:36,778
an incorrect prediction. Now we will update the

31
00:01:36,778 --> 00:01:40,380
state depending on the outcome. The way we update

32
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:43,180
the predictor, is to use the history to

33
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:47,670
index into the two counters. Meaning we will

34
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:51,140
be using this counter and modify the counter

35
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:53,100
according to the outcome. In this case, the

36
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:57,585
outcome is taken, so the first of the two counters will be moved to the weak

37
00:01:57,585 --> 00:02:00,420
not-taken state from the strong. So this counter

38
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:04,120
becomes weak not taken, this counter is not affected,

39
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:09,340
and then we shift into the history the actual

40
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:12,764
outcome, which was taken, so the history becomes 1. When

41
00:02:12,764 --> 00:02:16,462
the history is 1, we're going to be using the second

42
00:02:16,462 --> 00:02:19,756
of the two counters. So pretty much, we use the

43
00:02:19,756 --> 00:02:21,786
history to kind of index into this array of

44
00:02:21,786 --> 00:02:24,396
counters that only has two counters, so when it's 1

45
00:02:24,396 --> 00:02:27,800
we use this one. The prediction will be not taken

46
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,540
and it will be right. The state of the predictor

47
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:32,830
is now updated, so that we use the

48
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:35,970
history to index again into the counter, modify that

49
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:38,838
counter according to the outcome. It stays strong

50
00:02:38,838 --> 00:02:42,638
not taken, because that's already as convinced about the

51
00:02:42,638 --> 00:02:45,740
not taken outcome as it can be. The

52
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:49,507
other counter just stays the same. And the history

53
00:02:49,507 --> 00:02:51,577
now shifts in the zero because of the

54
00:02:51,577 --> 00:02:55,818
not taken outcome. So now we have the state

55
00:02:55,818 --> 00:02:58,266
of 0 weak not taken, strong not taken to

56
00:02:58,266 --> 00:03:02,620
predict the next outcome. Our prediction now will index into

57
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:05,590
the array of counters, get the first one. Weak

58
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:09,040
not taken means that we still predict not taken. We

59
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,002
are wrong. We update the predictor by finding the

60
00:03:12,002 --> 00:03:14,634
counter that corresponds to the history and this case 0

61
00:03:14,634 --> 00:03:17,454
means we use this one. We update it using the

62
00:03:17,454 --> 00:03:20,900
outcome from weak not take we go to weak taken.

63
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:24,220
The other counter stays the same, the history shifts

64
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:27,430
in the one for taken and this is the new

65
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:30,236
state that we use to predict the next outcome. 1

66
00:03:30,236 --> 00:03:33,197
means we use this counter, that counter says strong not

67
00:03:33,197 --> 00:03:36,222
taken, so we predict not taken. We are correct,

68
00:03:36,222 --> 00:03:39,872
update the predictor, 1 means we update this counter with

69
00:03:39,872 --> 00:03:42,938
not taken, so it stays strong not taken, this one

70
00:03:42,938 --> 00:03:47,530
stays weak not taken because it's not affected by this.

71
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:50,050
Not taken is shifted into the history so we

72
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:52,282
can 0, and now we use this to predict

73
00:03:52,282 --> 00:03:55,880
the next outcome. 0 means we use this counter,

74
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:58,652
this counter say weak taken so we predict taken and

75
00:03:58,652 --> 00:04:02,690
we predict correctly. We update the predictor by using

76
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:06,680
0 to tell us which counter to update. Taken is

77
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,640
used to update the counter, so from weak taken

78
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,690
it becomes strong taken. The other counter stays the same.

79
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:15,610
The history shifts in a 1, so we get

80
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:18,750
this. 1 means we use this counter next. It says

81
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:21,880
not taken. We predict not taken and we are

82
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:25,070
right. Update the state of the predictor. 1 means we

83
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:28,480
update this one with not taken. It stays strongly

84
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:32,195
not taken, this one stays the same. History shifts in

85
00:04:32,195 --> 00:04:34,380
a 0 so it becomes 0. We use 0

86
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:38,170
to tell us which counter. This one it's strong taken,

87
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:43,000
so we predict taken and we will be right. And as you can see, from now on we get

88
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,680
perfect prediction in this predictor. Why? Well, because if

89
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:50,100
the previous outcome was 0, we are now guessing that

90
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:53,447
the next outcome will be taken. If the previous

91
00:04:53,447 --> 00:04:56,483
outcome was 1, then we are predicting that the next

92
00:04:56,483 --> 00:04:59,126
outcome will be not taken. And now we do this

93
00:04:59,126 --> 00:05:03,350
continuously because both of these counters have learned strong decisions,

94
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:05,462
because every time we have seen a 0, it

95
00:05:05,462 --> 00:05:08,022
was followed by taken, every time we have seen a

96
00:05:08,022 --> 00:05:11,220
1, it was followed by not taken. So this predictor

97
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:15,670
learned the pattern of taken, not taken, taken et cetera.
