00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,780
Here, I made four changes to the code.

2
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:07,010
I replaced cut with color in the aesthetic wrapper.

3
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:09,920
I also changed the legend title and the

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:13,390
plot title, to use the word color. And finally,

5
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:15,980
I removed the reverse parameter in the legend,

6
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:17,820
so that the best color would be at the

7
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:21,940
top of the list in the legend. Now that we've run our code, this is the output.
