1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,790
Early stage entrepreneurship
is really hard.

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:04,030
You have to do everything.

3
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:06,340
And so, it's very easy to get off-track.

4
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:11,040
It's very easy to dive down into trying
to build the perfect marketing plan,

5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,010
maybe we even don't have a product yet,
or

6
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:16,840
you can dive into the code of a product
making it perfect when it doesn't even

7
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:20,180
work yet, there's nothing to display,
nothing to show people.

8
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:21,360
So, as an entrepreneur,

9
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:24,270
the thing that you really have
to keep in mind is focus.

10
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:27,170
What are the things that you're focused
on that are going to make your business

11
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:28,180
move forward?

12
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:30,720
It may not be the things that
you want to work on today.

13
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,200
It may not be the things that
you think are the most fun.

14
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,210
But you have to constantly step back and
say,

15
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:38,950
okay, what is the most important thing I
need to do to move the business forward?

16
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:40,270
And focus on that.

17
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:42,620
And there are so many distractions, and

18
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:46,380
you just have to let yourself move
forward and not get sidetracked.
