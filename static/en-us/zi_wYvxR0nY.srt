When we find the midpoint between two points, we're really just taking the

2
00:00:04,764 --> 00:00:09,905
average of their x-coordinates and their y-coordinates. In the quiz before this

3
00:00:09,917 --> 00:00:14,481
one, we found that the midpoint between points a,b and cd is just a plus c over

4
00:00:14,481 --> 00:00:20,294
2 b plus d over 2. This x-coordinate here of the midpoint, is just the average

5
00:00:20,306 --> 00:00:24,300
of a and c. And the same is true of the y-coordinate for b and d. So, thinking

6
00:00:24,312 --> 00:00:28,569
of finding midpoint this way, as just averaging x and y coordinates, sometimes

7
00:00:28,581 --> 00:00:32,601
makes the math feel a little more intuitive and easier to remember how to do.
