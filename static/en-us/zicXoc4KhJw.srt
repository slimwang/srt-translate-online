1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:01,653
50.

2
00:00:01,653 --> 00:00:04,126
That's how many apps were available 
in Android Market

3
00:00:04,126 --> 00:00:06,510
as Google Play was known 
when it first launched

4
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:09,460
alongside the first 
Android device in 2008.

5
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:13,990
A few days later, Android Market opened
for all app developers to register

6
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:16,900
and start publishing their apps 
without any review

7
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:20,700
or validation requirements 
from Google, OEMs, or carriers.

8
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:24,765
For us as developers, 
the ability to distribute apps

9
00:00:24,765 --> 00:00:28,170
and the possibility of monetizing them 
through up front payments,

10
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:31,200
in app billing, and advertising,
directly to the owners

11
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:35,230
over a billion android devices,
is one of the most exciting opportunities

12
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:39,850
made possible by the Android ecosystem. 
Growing up in the dark days

13
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:43,260
before smartphones and the Internet,
If I wanted a new game or app,

14
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:46,760
I had to go to a physical store 
and pay for a cardboard box

15
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:51,140
filled with floppy disks or CDROMs. 
As developers, a big part

16
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:54,380
of our business plan back then
was how to get those boxes

17
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:58,660
of our software onto those shelves.
Or in the world of mobile,

18
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:02,220
how to secure a carrier or OEM deal 
to get our apps preloaded

19
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:05,290
onto devices. 
Today I can install

20
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:07,992
over a million apps or games 
created by tens,

21
00:01:07,992 --> 00:01:11,840
if not hundreds of thousands 
of developers via Google Play,

22
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:15,190
all with a click of a button. 
That's translated

23
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:18,840
into tens of billions of app installs,
an incredible opportunity

24
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:22,000
to distribute apps to Android users 
in hundreds of countries.

25
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:26,410
Now in the early days of Android, 
being fast and launching first

26
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:31,010
was a pretty solid strategy for success,
but as those first 50 apps

27
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:34,550
quickly grew to hundreds, thousands, 
and now over a million apps,

28
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:38,110
it takes a lot more than speed 
to stand out from the crowd.

29
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,020
These days, the tables stakes 
are a base line of quality,

30
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:45,990
and willingness to create 
great experiences for all your users.

31
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:49,760
Of course, app quality can
be somewhat subjective,

32
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:53,750
but over the years we've identified
the core criteria that users

33
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:57,730
identify with apps of high quality.
And to make your life easier,

34
00:01:57,730 --> 00:02:00,230
they're all available 
on the Android developer site

35
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:03,160
for you to review. 
This is the same checklist

36
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:06,500
that the merchandising team 
for Google Play used to ensure only apps

37
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,810
of quality are featured 
in their promotions

38
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:12,010
and editor's choice categories. 
And they include everything,

39
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:14,023
from following 
the app design guidelines

40
00:02:14,023 --> 00:02:16,026
to supporting 
different screen orientations,

41
00:02:16,026 --> 00:02:19,350
tablets, and other devices.
And, of course, ensuring that

42
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:23,360
your app is stable and performant. 
So, with over a million apps

43
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,360
already available in Google Play 
it's no longer just a numbers game.

44
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:32,010
We don't need just more apps or games, 
or even more developers.

45
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:36,920
What we want is high quality apps 
from great developers, like you.
