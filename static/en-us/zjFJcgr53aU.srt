00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,370
By the end of this work session you'll
be able to replace the words noun and

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:05,990
verb in a string, with your own input.

3
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:07,981
You'll do this in two different ways,
and

4
00:00:07,981 --> 00:00:10,873
you'll see how your new knowledge
of strings can be applied.

5
00:00:10,873 --> 00:00:14,086
Now, this might not seem like a big
deal, just replacing the words noun and

6
00:00:14,086 --> 00:00:16,993
verb in a single string, but trust me,
this is a fundamental part of

7
00:00:16,993 --> 00:00:19,550
the Mad Lib generator you're
well on your way to building.
