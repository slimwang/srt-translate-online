1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
All right. Initially we have--I cut 9.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
So these are the cuts that I made and just to show that it's still connected.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
There's a little bit of plastic that goes around without passing through any cuts

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
but there should be no loops--so every little region here that a turtle could get trapped in

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
we have a cut in it and in fact, a series of cuts that gets you to the outside.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
So this region here exits out through here, here and out.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
This region say you exit here, here and out, region then run out, run out, this one here and out.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Every region now opens up and then some other region will actually close up.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
So how many cuts did I make and I'm going to say--so did you.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
There are many, many ways of doing these cuts, but I still think you'll had 14.
