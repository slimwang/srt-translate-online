00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:02,969
When monetizing an e-commerce site,

2
00:00:02,969 --> 00:00:06,450
there are four main principles
you should keep in mind.

3
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:09,600
First, let users explore
before they commit.

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:12,740
Second, let users purchase as guest.

5
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:16,320
Third, make it easy to
finish from another device.

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:21,050
Four, use existing information
to maximize the convenience.

7
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:22,425
Now lets go deeper on each rule.

8
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,853
Requiring a log in or account creation
too early in a site experience can be

9
00:00:28,853 --> 00:00:30,531
harmful to conversions.

10
00:00:30,531 --> 00:00:33,921
Beware of making enemies
at registration gates.

11
00:00:33,921 --> 00:00:37,480
Don't require customer account
registration up front.

12
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:40,480
We understand that getting access
to the customer information and

13
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,760
preferences can be integral
to your website success.

14
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,390
But don't ask for
it too early in the process.

15
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:48,560
You can see here on the left side,

16
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:54,170
an example of a pop-up that could block
the users from achieving her goals.

17
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:57,450
However, here on the right side,
you could be productive and

18
00:00:57,450 --> 00:00:58,780
browse the site right away.

19
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,520
Offer the option to
check out as a guest and

20
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,990
encourage registration
with tangible benefits.

21
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:10,710
If purchasing is something that people
can do on your website, then you want to

22
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:15,850
aim for the option to clearly enable
users to check out as guests.

23
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:19,310
The guest option is universally
preferred when users didn't have

24
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:20,630
an existing account.

25
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,290
At the end of the guest
checkout process,

26
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:28,820
you have another opportunity to
get users to create an account.

27
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:32,260
And you can communicate tangible
benefits to them for doing so, for

28
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:35,730
example, so
that they could track their order.

29
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:40,260
Also remember that you don't
want to negate the benefits of

30
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:44,810
free users' purchase by having
a process that isn't smooth here.

31
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:48,590
All browsers including the ability
to auto complete forms, so

32
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:50,630
make sure you are using them.

33
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:56,980
Offer an easy way to save or
share information across devices,

34
00:01:56,980 --> 00:02:01,660
providing functionality to allow
users to pick up where they left off.

35
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:04,730
Seek opportunities to
scaffold users behavior and

36
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:09,180
facilitate cross-channel conversion
through your mobile website.

37
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:13,240
Your users move from one
device to another, or

38
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:17,230
simply want to go back to where
they were on the same device.

39
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:19,596
This functionality
could help them a lot.

40
00:02:19,596 --> 00:02:24,000
As you could see here, they could email
it or share it on social networks.

41
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:29,110
Please take advantage of
information you already have or

42
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:34,750
use third party payment service to
make conversion as easy as possible.

43
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:37,700
Another useful way to streamline
the conversion's experience for

44
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,360
users is to know and

45
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:44,550
use what already exists in terms of
information that the user has provided.

46
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:49,230
We also find that autofilling, when
possible, was a huge benefit to users.
