00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,620
An IPv4 address is actually a 32-bit or
4 octet value,

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:07,470
which we usually write as a dotted quad.

3
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:11,250
But writing an IP address
as four decimal numbers is

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:14,085
just a convention to
make it easier to read.

5
00:00:14,085 --> 00:00:19,045
When it's used between computers it's
just a 32 bit long string of bits.

6
00:00:19,045 --> 00:00:24,305
However, not all of the possible 32 bit
values are used for real addresses.

7
00:00:24,305 --> 00:00:27,055
Some of them are reserved for
special protocols.

8
00:00:27,055 --> 00:00:30,105
Some of them are reserved for
internal private networks.

9
00:00:30,105 --> 00:00:33,070
Some of them are for
testing or for documentation.

10
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:37,900
In fact, just over one-eighth
of all possible IPv4 addresses,

11
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:41,600
are set aside for something other
than addressing public hosts.

12
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,940
But as you'll see, even if we did use
all 32 bit addresses to represent public

13
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:48,270
hosts that still wouldn't
really be enough.
