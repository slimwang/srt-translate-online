00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:04,184
Your task is going to be to derive the reflection equation. So you're given the

2
00:00:04,184 --> 00:00:08,102
V vector towards the eye, and the mirror surface is normal N. These 2 vectors

3
00:00:08,102 --> 00:00:12,405
are normalized and the dot product between them is computed and stored as D.

4
00:00:12,405 --> 00:00:16,500
You are now given 2 other vectors, dV which is the V vector multiplied by this

5
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:22,754
dot product and dN, the normal multiplied by this dark product. You can see how

6
00:00:22,754 --> 00:00:26,446
this 2 vectors are produced here. For example DV is shown as the projection of

7
00:00:26,446 --> 00:00:32,210
N on to the V vector. And DN is shown as the projection of V onto the N vector.

8
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:35,717
Here's our normalized reflection vector R, this is our goal. The question to

9
00:00:35,717 --> 00:00:39,375
you is given these 4 vectors, how do we compute this normalized reflection

10
00:00:39,375 --> 00:00:43,480
direction vector? You can use any and all of the four vectors in your answer

11
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:48,125
which should consist of 4 integers. These integers can be positive, negative or

12
00:00:48,125 --> 00:00:52,970
0. For example, if you think the single copy of DN vector negated is the same

13
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:59,040
as the R vector, you would put 0, negative 1, 0, 0. Here's a hint. This answer

14
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,830
is not correct. What values form the right answer?
