1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:01,200
Woohoo.

2
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:02,520
Excellent work.

3
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:04,860
You are done!

4
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:07,440
But, consider you've been
collecting all these clues,

5
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,700
I've got one final little question.

6
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:10,660
So tell me.

7
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:12,830
Who am I making this coffee for?

8
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:14,470
You'll need the clues to
get the correct answer
