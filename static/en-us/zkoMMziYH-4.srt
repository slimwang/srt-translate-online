00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:05,960
In the last problem, we found f of g of 5. For this problem, we're going to

2
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:10,234
find g of f of 5. We're going to reverse the composition. Sometimes you'd

3
00:00:10,234 --> 00:00:14,796
want to do this, since functions might rely on each other in different ways. So

4
00:00:14,796 --> 00:00:19,759
what would be the output of the final result for this composition? Write that

5
00:00:19,759 --> 00:00:21,321
answer here.
