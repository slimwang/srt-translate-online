00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,230
Now let's take a look at macro viruses.

2
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:04,960
First, what is a macro?

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:08,580
A macro is actually a program
embedded in a document,

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:10,830
such as a Microsoft Word Document.

5
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:12,970
It typically contains instructions for

6
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:17,440
some useful functions, such as opening
a file or starting a new application.

7
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,200
And because a macro is
an executable program,

8
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:25,210
it can be infected by viruses just
like any other executable programs.

9
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:30,480
What's unique about macro viruses is
that users typically don't suspect that

10
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,840
a document will contain a virus.

11
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:35,880
Here's how a macro virus
can typically spread.

12
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:39,000
First, the attacker creates
a macro that contains a virus and

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,030
then attach it to a Word Document.

14
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:43,350
And then this document
can be sent around, for

15
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:45,740
example, through e-mail attachment.

16
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:50,460
And then, when an unsuspecting user
clicks on the e-mail attachment and

17
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:54,970
opens the document, the document
is opened on the user's computer.

18
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:58,420
When the document is opened,
the macro executes and

19
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:01,370
as a result, the macro virus also runs.

20
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:05,510
The virus then copies itself
to the global macro file.

21
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:10,730
When the document opens, the macro
executes and the macro virus also runs.

22
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:14,380
When the macro virus runs,
it can perform a number of malicious

23
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:18,000
activities, such as sending
the same Word Document

24
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,910
to a number of users in the user's
address book as an attachment.

25
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:23,470
And the spreading itself.

26
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:27,220
What's more interesting is that
the macro virus can copy itself to

27
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:29,160
the global macro file.

28
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:32,430
As a result whenever the user
opens a new document or

29
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:37,170
creates a new document, the global macro
will be copied into the document, and

30
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:40,050
that's another way that
the macro virus can spread.
