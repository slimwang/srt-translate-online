00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,616
Let's start with our vertical line and just pick 2 random points along it. So,

2
00:00:04,628 --> 00:00:09,282
here's a point, and here's a point. The coordinates of this line point are 2,7.

3
00:00:09,294 --> 00:00:13,719
And this is the point 2, negative 3. The coordinate these 2 points on the

4
00:00:13,731 --> 00:00:19,159
vertical line share is the x-coordinate. So I guess, all points on a vertical

5
00:00:19,171 --> 00:00:24,474
line have the same x-coordinate. Let's do the same thing for a horizontal line.

6
00:00:24,587 --> 00:00:28,498
We have the point negative 8, negative 5, and another point 5, negative 5. These

7
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:33,408
two points, along the horizontal line, share their y value. So, I guess, all

8
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:36,952
points along horizontal lines have the same y value.
