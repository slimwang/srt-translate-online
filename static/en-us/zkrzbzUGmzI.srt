1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,429
Wow, we covered a lot of material.

2
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:03,830
>> Yeah, we did.

3
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:07,330
>> As you continue through
the rest of this course,

4
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:09,339
remember what you
learned in this lesson.

5
00:00:09,339 --> 00:00:12,439
First, breaking down problems
into their logical steps

6
00:00:12,439 --> 00:00:15,140
is the first sign of a good programmer.

7
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:16,239
As you face new challenges,

8
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:20,230
stop to think about how you could break
the problem down into smaller steps.

9
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:22,350
>> Second,
using conditional statements and

10
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:26,780
logical operators will be paramount to
your success as a JavaScript programmer.

11
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:28,920
By telling your code when and
how to run,

12
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:32,770
you can create algorithms to solve
even the most complex problems.

13
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:33,950
>> And finally,

14
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:37,800
remember the advanced techniques you
learned towards the end of this lesson.

15
00:00:37,799 --> 00:00:42,459
Things like truthy and falsy, the
ternary operator, and switch statements

16
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:46,230
will pop up more often as you begin
to work with more advanced code.

17
00:00:46,229 --> 00:00:47,279
>> That's it for now.

18
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,660
We'll be waiting for
you in the next lesson.
