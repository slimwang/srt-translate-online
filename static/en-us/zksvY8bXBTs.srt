00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,512
Let's continue along this vein of symmetry of parabolas. Now when we were

2
00:00:03,512 --> 00:00:07,398
talking about linear equations, a super vital part of everything that we talked

3
00:00:07,398 --> 00:00:10,868
was the slope of a line. And we can find the slope of a line by taking any two

4
00:00:10,868 --> 00:00:14,174
points along it and taking the ratio of the difference between their y

5
00:00:14,174 --> 00:00:18,048
coordinates to the difference between their x coordinate. We haven't however

6
00:00:18,048 --> 00:00:21,830
considered this slope of a curve yet of a graph of anything that isn't just a

7
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:25,818
straight line. This may seem a little bit funny to think about but I think its

8
00:00:25,818 --> 00:00:29,950
pretty important. There is a single sub that applies to every single point along

9
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:33,819
this curve. But we can talk about slope any local sense. Its pretty easy to see

10
00:00:33,819 --> 00:00:37,663
what the slope of a single part of the curve is by picking a point on the line,

11
00:00:37,663 --> 00:00:41,569
lets say this one and drawing a line that just touches the curve at that point

12
00:00:41,569 --> 00:00:45,607
and has the same slope as the curve does right there. So for every point on a

13
00:00:45,607 --> 00:00:49,699
curve we can say that there is a line tangent to that point, that has the same

14
00:00:49,699 --> 00:00:53,900
slope as the curve at that point and barely touches the curve right there. So

15
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:57,743
it's actually really hard to draw an exact tangent line, but this is a pretty

16
00:00:57,743 --> 00:01:01,951
good approximation. We pick two points that are infinitesimally far away from

17
00:01:01,951 --> 00:01:05,794
this point or in other words two points that are as close as we can possibly

18
00:01:05,794 --> 00:01:09,948
pick, to this point that we're interested in. We can draw the line connecting

19
00:01:09,948 --> 00:01:14,326
those two points and then extend that line, tend up with the tangent line. Now

20
00:01:14,326 --> 00:01:18,814
you have to wait for calculus to get a really deep and rigorous understanding of

21
00:01:18,814 --> 00:01:23,166
tangent lines, but they're still really useful for us for understanding the

22
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:27,540
shapes of parabolas and of other curves as well. So now I've drawn 3 different

23
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:31,986
lines that are tangent to 3 different points on this parabola. I've labelled

24
00:01:31,986 --> 00:01:36,186
them A, B and C and for each of those, I'd like you to tell me what the sign of

25
00:01:36,186 --> 00:01:40,577
the slope of the line is. Is it positive, negative, or 0? Check the proper box

26
00:01:40,577 --> 00:01:41,419
for each line.
