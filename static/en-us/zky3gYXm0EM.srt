1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:02,710
Our next optimization
is forward checking.

2
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:04,650
Basically for each unassigned variable.

3
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:07,290
We are going to keep track of
the remaining legal values.

4
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:08,080
>> I get it.

5
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,789
So, if we ever make a decision that
causes an unassigned variable to not be

6
00:00:11,789 --> 00:00:13,139
able to have a value.

7
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:14,929
We stop our search and back up.

8
00:00:14,929 --> 00:00:15,449
>> Right.

9
00:00:15,449 --> 00:00:17,899
>> Let's try that with
the Australia example.

10
00:00:17,899 --> 00:00:19,599
We start with nothing colored and

11
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,460
all the regions could have
any of the three colors.

12
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:25,429
>> In our first step we assign
orange to Western Australia.

13
00:00:25,429 --> 00:00:28,449
That removes orange from the colors
available to the Northern Territory and

14
00:00:28,449 --> 00:00:29,929
to Southern Australia.

15
00:00:29,929 --> 00:00:32,380
>> Suppose we assign
green to Queensland.

16
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:37,640
Now both the Northern Territory and
Southern Australia can only have blue.

17
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:40,670
And New South Wales can have orange or
blue.

18
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:42,840
If we assign blue to Victoria.

19
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,290
>> Then we see that New South Wales
can only have orange.

20
00:00:45,289 --> 00:00:49,589
The normal territory can only have blue
and south australia can't have anything.

21
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:51,290
>> So, we figured out that we are stuck.

22
00:00:51,289 --> 00:00:54,000
And can back track earlier than
we would have if we tried to

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,969
continue assigning variables.

24
00:00:55,969 --> 00:00:58,659
>> Exactly, forward checking
is a early warning system

25
00:00:58,659 --> 00:01:00,539
that a search is going
down the wrong branch.
