00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:05,240
Well, remember that the degrees of freedom is n minus one, so our degrees of

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:09,798
freedom is 29, so if we bring up the t table, we look for degrees of freedom is

3
00:00:09,798 --> 00:00:18,930
29, and we also know that if alpha equals 0.05 for a two tailed test. Then

4
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:23,702
0.025 is in each tail. So we look for where it says the tail probability is

5
00:00:23,702 --> 00:00:32,386
0.025. At 29 degrees of freedom, we get 2.045 as our t critical value. That

6
00:00:32,386 --> 00:00:37,726
means that negative 2.045 is the t critical value that cuts off the lower

7
00:00:37,726 --> 00:00:39,626
0.025.
