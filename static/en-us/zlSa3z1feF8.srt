1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Obviously, the mean is 5.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
When you sum up the squares, here the difference is -2Â² would be 4.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
It'd be 1 over here--0, 1, 4.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:16,000
You get 10, but you're going to compute the average distance, which is 10/5--that's 2.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 99:59:59,999
The square root of this is about 1.414.
