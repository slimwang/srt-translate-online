1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,450
To answer that question, we need to rearrange our data a

2
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:05,730
little bit. Right now, our data is in long format. We

3
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:08,710
have many rows. And, notice how that the variables that we

4
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:12,750
grouped over, male and female, have been repeated. They're repeated for each

5
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:16,880
year. So let's do something else besides this long data format.

6
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,400
What we're going to do is convert it to a wide format. This

7
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:22,530
new data frame will have one row for each age, and

8
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:26,350
then we'll put the median friend count inside of males and females.

9
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:28,830
Many times when computing with and exploring data,

10
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:30,860
it's helpful to move back and forth between these

11
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:33,740
different arrangements. To carry this out in R,

12
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:36,440
we're going to be using the reshape2 package. Now, if

13
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,210
the different between wide and long data is

14
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:40,160
still a little bit fuzzy to you, I recommend

15
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,490
pausing the video right now. You can read through

16
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:44,900
another example in the instructor notes before moving on.
