00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,960
Hey, so, one particular thing we need to
be concerned about is all the tracking

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:10,590
that happens when we visit websites,
they know where we're going.

3
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:12,388
So if you go to a website of course,

4
00:00:12,388 --> 00:00:16,422
they will know that you're accessing
that website, but what about others?

5
00:00:16,422 --> 00:00:20,806
So you'll be surprised how many other
websites are able to figure out that you

6
00:00:20,806 --> 00:00:23,670
withered for
example www.NewYorkTimes.com.

7
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:26,880
These are tens of them,
I think at one point I read

8
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,800
50 other sites learn about the fact that
you are visiting www.NewYorkTimes.com.

9
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,790
These third parties are able to
do it because they're either

10
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:38,480
advertisements embedded in the New
York Times phase that you get back, or

11
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,080
they're the likes, the Facebook,
Twitter, and whatever other things.

12
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:45,030
And some of these things
we may not even see or

13
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:48,060
pay attention to, but
essentially, we pull some

14
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:52,370
bit of the content that makes up the
page from all these websites that allow

15
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:55,270
them to track the fact that we
are visiting New York Times.

16
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:58,330
So you can do what is called
third party cookie blocking.

17
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:01,247
So browsers actually, they allow
you to do a variety of things.

18
00:01:01,247 --> 00:01:02,300
You can block cookies.

19
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:03,790
If you block cookies altogether,

20
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:07,610
then maybe you can't do anything useful
with the NewYorkTimes.com either, but

21
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:10,660
third party cookies blocking,
of course, protects you.

22
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:13,610
Blocking third party cookies of course,
protects you.

23
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:17,960
You can tell your browser that
you don't like to be tracked, and

24
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:22,380
in this case, the browser when it
sends some information to a website

25
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:25,610
would actually tell the website that
the user doesn't want to be tracked.

26
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:28,570
Whether the website honors that or
not is a different question.

27
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:34,093
Cookies are kept on your computer
to track your history and so on.

28
00:01:34,093 --> 00:01:37,560
We can clear those and when the next
time you visit the website,

29
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,910
the website won't have this knowledge
of what you had done previously.

30
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:43,780
You can block pop-ups.

31
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:48,590
You can, there are other private
browsing sort of things that you can do,

32
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:53,710
browser modes that and
clear out any state that may be

33
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:58,110
built while you're using
a tab incognito mode or

34
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:02,420
even more sort of aggressive privacy
things that you can do to browsers.

35
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:05,830
So the idea is that
tracking is progressive.

36
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:07,860
There's some things we can do about it.

37
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:12,510
We don't know how effective those things
are but at least there are things that

38
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:16,750
you can do by going into your privacy
setting of your browser that you use.

39
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:18,880
And they're slightly different
across different browsers.

40
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:22,330
So So I'm not talking a great
deal about how exactly you do,

41
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:25,260
but I would highly encourage
you to explore these.
