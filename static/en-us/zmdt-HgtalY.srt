00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,914
In the last lesson, we looked at solving problems and writing expressions. This

2
00:00:03,926 --> 00:00:07,587
time, we're going to look at solving inequalities. We can use inequalities to

3
00:00:07,599 --> 00:00:11,497
compare values. We can figure out what amount is less than or greater than some

4
00:00:11,509 --> 00:00:15,332
other amount. Before we start solving inequalities, let's look at an equation

5
00:00:15,344 --> 00:00:20,375
and think aobut how many solutions there are. For this equation, figure out how

6
00:00:20,387 --> 00:00:26,240
many solutions there are, and think about how do you know. Choose one of these

00:00:26,252 --> 00:00:26,860
answers.
