1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Now that you've got a pretty good idea of the architecture decisions we made on Reddit

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
and how we kind of grew the site and stored data differently over time,

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
what I'd like to talk about is now we actually grew the site from a social point of view--

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
how we got users and how we maintained the feel that Reddit has.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
It's hard for me or anybody to really take credit for growing Reddit,

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
because it's a social thing and even if Alexis and I started over today knowing everything

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
we know now, it'd be very hard to get a site like Reddit off the ground.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Social websites require a little bit of magic to work, and we were fortunate enough to have it.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
We did a lot of very important things that I think helped,

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
one of which was in the beginning Alexis and I submitted all the content.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
If you go to our Reddit submission page now, it basically boils down to two fields.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
In the early days it was just two fields.

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
You basically had a field called "URL," which is the URL of the site you were submitting,

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
and "Title," which was the title of that site, and that would be the link you submitted to Reddit.

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
If Alexis and I went to the page we had a third field called "User,"

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
and we could type in a name here, and when we hit submit,

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
we would automatically register this user if that name didn't exist

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
and submit the content as that user.

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
You'd go to Reddit in the early days, the first couple of months,

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
and there'd be tons of content.

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I shouldn't say "fake content," but it was fake users. It was really all just Alexis and I.

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
That did two things, and I think this is important to any site where you want to have a community feel.

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
The first thing it did was it set the tone.

24
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Websites have this kind of inertia, and we submitted content

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
that we would be interested in seeing.

26
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
That meant the content on Reddit, at least for us and for our peer group,

27
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
it was good, interesting stuff.

28
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
We wanted a site with the most interesting content online, and s owe did our best to find it

29
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
and then we submitted that content ourselves.

30
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
So when you show up to Reddit, you kind of know what the site is all about.

31
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
The other thing it did was it made the site feel alive.

32
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Users like to feel a part of something.

33
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
If they showed up to the website and the front page was blank,

34
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
it just looks like a ghost town.

35
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
You don't want to live in a ghost town. You'd rather live in New York City. Most people would.

36
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
That's why New York City is so big and ghost towns, by definition, aren't.

37
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
That was really fortunate, and I don't know what made us do this.

38
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
In hindsight it's really easy to say this was how it happened,

39
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
but at the time I think we were just embarrassed to have an empty website,

40
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
so we submitted the content, and it worked.

41
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I remember the first day a few months in when we didn't have to submit any content,

42
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
and that was such a magical day for us, because then we knew the site was working on its own.

43
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
It was really, really cool. It took a while to get there.

44
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
We really kind of had to will this into existence.

45
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Another thing about the site is it didn't have any comments to begin with.

46
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I don't know that this helped or hindered us. It was just we didn't get around to writing it.

47
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I think the only thing I want to say here is that people look at Reddit,

48
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
and if you get into it you quickly realize that the comments are what makes Reddit work.

49
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
That's where the really incredible community lives.

50
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
And Reddit grew quite a bit before we even had a comment system.

51
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
That came later, and it just kind of goes to show how it's not always obvious what

52
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
the most important part of a site is, and it's better just to kind of get something online

53
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
and start experimenting with it than to build the whole system out and have it fail.

54
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
We didn't have any categorization. What we wanted users to do was submit links.

55
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
We didn't want them to have to think about categories, think about tags.

56
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Those are all decisions, and the more decisions you have the harder it is to interact with the site.

57
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
We had categorization on the site--I should say--for about one day.

58
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I added it one night, and Alexis took all the links that had ever been submitted to Reddit

59
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
and categorized them, so when users came the next morning everything would be ready to go.

60
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
One of our first investors and advisers was like why did you add categorization.

61
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
That ruined everything. Get rid of it, so we did.

62
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Alexis ended up--he wasted all of that time, but that was really good advice.

63
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Not having categorization meant users could just show up and submit content.

64
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
The serendipity of the front page was really interesting.

65
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Another thing we did was we didn't collect emails.

66
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Every site on there had this signup process

67
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
where you'd have to like enter your email address and then confirm an email--

68
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
all those sets you have to do.

69
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
One of those steps involves you actually leaving your browser to go to your email program

70
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
or go to Gmail or whatever just to become a member.

71
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
If you want members and you want submissions, why would you add all the barriers

72
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
like required email addresses?

73
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
We figured we're not going to spam people. We don't have any emails to send.

74
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Why would we need their email addresses? So we didn't collect them.

75
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
That allowed users to register that much faster, I think, was a contributing factor to our ability to grow.

76
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Another big thing we did was no censorship.

77
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
We didn't care what content was submitted to Reddit.

78
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Unless it was like overtly racist, we just let it be, especially if it was critical to us.

79
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
That created this kind of sense of community, this sense of trust.

80
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
That's what ultimately, I think, allowed Reddit to grow to this tremendous size

81
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
is the users believed in us and wanted to be a part of this community.

82
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
When we made mistakes, even when I goofed one the password hashing thing,

83
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
for example, they would stick with us because they realized our heart was in the right place.

84
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
We just wanted to make a site that was new and interesting .

85
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
We didn't want to sell our users. We didn't want to ruin the site.

86
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
We just wanted to have good content.
