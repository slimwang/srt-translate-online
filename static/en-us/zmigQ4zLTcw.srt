00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:03,990
HttpURLConnection is one HTTP client

2
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:07,350
that you can use to make
HTTP requests in Android.

3
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:09,560
Now, you can also use
third-party libraries that

4
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:11,080
weren't created by Google.

5
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:15,320
For example, OKHttp is a popular
open-source HTTP client

6
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:17,610
created by
the Square Mobile Payments Company.

7
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:19,720
They've done a lot of
open-source work for Android.

8
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,120
This class helps you send and

9
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:24,480
receive data across the web
using an HTTP connection.

10
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,930
Once you have a URL,

11
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:30,000
actually opening up an HTTP connection
is actually pretty straightforward.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,160
You start by calling url.openConnection.

13
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:35,210
Then to actually fire
off the connection, and

14
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:39,800
be ready to return results, you go ahead
and you specify the RequestMethod.

15
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:43,020
In this case,
we're going to use the GET HTTP method.

16
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:48,630
Then, you go ahead and call Connect and
then finally, you call getInputStream

17
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:52,280
on your connection which is going to be
the input stream containing the results.

18
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:54,720
Now, despite the of
the codes that you see here,

19
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:58,150
the Android platform is actually
handling many of the complex networking

20
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:00,250
details on to the hood for you.

21
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:03,370
In other words, Android as an operating
system is actually working with your

22
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:07,250
device's hardware to setup connection
and handled some of the physical steps

23
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:09,810
that need to happen in order for
the communication to work.
