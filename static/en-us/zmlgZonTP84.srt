00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:04,300
Okay, so here we are at
Firebase's Example Datasets.

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:07,810
These are some public data sets that
are freely available to access.

3
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:09,060
You can access the data and

4
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:11,887
use it in your app,
though you can't write to the data set.

5
00:00:11,887 --> 00:00:16,673
They're also good examples of what
larger Firebase databases look like.

6
00:00:16,673 --> 00:00:20,425
So while I take a look at
the links I just sent over,

7
00:00:20,425 --> 00:00:22,045
why don't you pick one
that looks interesting so

8
00:00:22,045 --> 00:00:25,725
that we can discuss one of
the more populated data sets.

9
00:00:25,725 --> 00:00:26,835
>> Let's see.

10
00:00:26,835 --> 00:00:29,025
I'm liking the look of that
Cryptocurrencies Data Set.

11
00:00:29,025 --> 00:00:31,345
You know,
I might want to incorporate BitCoin and

12
00:00:31,345 --> 00:00:34,015
DogeCoin shopping into shopping
list plus plus someday.

13
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:38,560
And for the developer, if you're
not sure what a Cryptocurrency is,

14
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:40,790
the short answer is that
it's digital money.

15
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:43,550
And the long answer is
in the instructor notes.

16
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:45,780
Anyways, yes, Cryptocurrency it is.

17
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:46,710
>> Sounds good.

18
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:49,480
Let's take a look at the
Cryptocurrencies Firebase dashboard to

19
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:53,060
see what a mature Firebase
database looks like.

20
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:55,880
Here, I've got an app dashboard
that looks a lot like mine, but

21
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,430
with a bit more data.

22
00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:00,160
I can see here that I've got
three different key value pairs.

23
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,910
And instead of BitCoin having
one value associated with it,

24
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:07,320
it has a map with five
child key value pairs.

25
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:11,650
Look at the URL, this is known as the
root URL because it's the main page for

26
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:13,660
your Firebase database.

27
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:17,460
One of the cool things about Firebase is
that any of these collections of data,

28
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:20,460
which I'll call nodes,
has a URL associated with it.

29
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:25,255
For example, I can click on
this node that says dogecoin.

30
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:31,300
I am then directed to a page that just
shows the dogecoin subset of the data.

31
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:35,510
Similarly, the URL has updated
in the address bar, and

32
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:37,490
in the bread crumb of the interface.

33
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:42,240
If I click on a child node of dogecoin,
like bid, I can see the full path for

34
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,650
this in the address bar and
in the bread crumb.

35
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:49,160
So every piece and subset of data
in the database has a unique URL.

36
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:53,410
This is the location of the data,
also called the database location.

37
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:57,530
Just like a URL or file location,
you can enter the unique

38
00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:01,720
URL in the address bar and see
the specific data you are interested in.

39
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:05,508
It is important to understand how these
paths specify the location of your data.

40
00:02:05,508 --> 00:02:09,130
Since you use these paths to refer to
data that you're reading and writing.

41
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:11,580
Now let's navigate back to the root URL.

42
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:14,740
You might notice how the database
will occasionally flash yellow.

43
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,490
Yellow means that something is changing.

44
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:22,700
In our example, it might indicate the
time when the Bitcoin is last updated.

45
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:26,670
Notice how the parent objects of
the changed value are also changed.

46
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:28,530
Whenever a child is changed,

47
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:32,780
all parents also flash yellow,
because a part of them has changed.

48
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:33,420
As you add and

49
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:37,620
remove data from your app, you'll
see similar types of interactions.

50
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:41,290
Whenever any child data is added,
removed, changed or

51
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:46,070
moved, the parents also flash yellow
to show that they have changed.

52
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:48,560
What's the URL for ask in litecoin?
