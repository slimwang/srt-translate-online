There are ways you may have over thought this question, but I wasn't trying to

2
00:00:02,436 --> 00:00:05,932
be tricky here. The truth is that to go from San Jose all the way to San

3
00:00:05,932 --> 00:00:09,388
Francisco, we have to pass through every single one of these stations listed

4
00:00:09,388 --> 00:00:14,440
here, since their all along the path. That makes perfect sense. They're in

5
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:18,127
between the starting point and the ending point. So to go from here to here, we

6
00:00:18,127 --> 00:00:20,453
have to pass through what's in between.
