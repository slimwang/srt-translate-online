1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,420
We talked about how file
system implementation

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:06,750
works in Unix-like systems or
Unix based systems.

3
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:10,260
And said open returns a file
descriptor which is a small number.

4
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:14,840
And the question is can a process
share a file with another process

5
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:17,000
by just sharing that file descriptor?
