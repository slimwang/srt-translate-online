1
00:00:00,318 --> 00:00:03,700
In module Eight I'm going to introduce to even specia,l and

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:08,220
really kind of from the, recent research efforts some of

3
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:11,040
the exciting new topics in computational photography.

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,680
For example, we'll learn about newer camera technologies.

5
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:17,420
How we can actually even control lighting in cameras,

6
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:20,200
to be able to generate newer forms of images.

7
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:24,270
How does concept of blur and deblur in images, and how do new forms of

8
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:29,770
computational cameras can be used to deal with those, types of artifacts?

9
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:31,870
More importantly, we'll also deal with the fact that now,

10
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:33,210
cameras are everywhere, and

11
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:37,280
this has led to a whole new form of social and crowd photography.

12
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,060
Again we'll discuss those types of examples, more importantly I

13
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:44,040
do want everybody to start thinking we will do a final project.

14
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:49,440
Or more appropriately you will do a final project of your own choosing, on

15
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,840
a topic that we covered in class, or something that you want to do on your own,

16
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:56,490
and we'd like to provide you with various types of supports to get you there.

17
00:00:56,490 --> 00:01:00,730
But more importantly, we want you to play around with newer concept on your own.

18
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:03,750
So that's an important part I want everybody to think about as you will

19
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:07,970
select topic, I will provide some examples of the kinds of things you could do,

20
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:11,190
and you will make it work for real in the last few weeks of class.
