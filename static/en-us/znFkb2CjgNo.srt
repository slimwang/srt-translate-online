00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:01,870
Let me talk a little bit
about image morphing.

2
00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:03,440
Here I'm going to demonstrate this.

3
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:06,040
And again, just to point out,
this may not be exactly the images.

4
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:09,240
But, we're just going to learn about
how we're going to do image morphing.

5
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:12,120
In the previous slide, I showed
you how we can use triangles and

6
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:15,440
deform them with the displacement
map to be able to generate

7
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,860
a morph field between two frames.

8
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:20,670
Of course,
we don't have to stick to just triangle.

9
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:24,110
It could be a quadrilateral
mesh that's also displaced by

10
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:26,230
various types of
interpolation techniques.

11
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:29,630
Minimum energy methods are widely used
with this to compute the best possibly

12
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:33,950
way of deforming from one surface to
the other or one mesh to the other.

13
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:37,540
So for example, in that case,
we would basically take a like this,

14
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:40,750
have another one that would be
deformed appropriately for this and

15
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:43,380
that would allow us to
generate in between images.

16
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:47,420
Another method we can use is find
corresponding features between

17
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:48,920
these two different images.

18
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:51,530
So in this case, of course,
it's an image we can actually relate to

19
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:55,220
quite well and
start identifying common features.

20
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:59,400
Both of them are faces, so basically
what I can do is now mark out the,

21
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:03,900
you know, the corners of the eyes,
crners of the nose, tip of the nose, and

22
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:06,950
also the three points on the lips.

23
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:11,640
And of course, I can do the same for
the leopard, or a cheetah image.

24
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,710
Again, if you notice,
these eyes have different forms, but

25
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:17,329
now I have these corresponding points.

26
00:01:17,329 --> 00:01:20,020
And I know this point is that one,
this point is that one.

27
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:22,700
And remember, all of the work
we've done with feature detection,

28
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:26,870
some of these will come out off
using things like algorithms.

29
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:28,310
Then they could be matched.

30
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:29,880
We can actually do more.

31
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:33,620
We can actually come up with
corresponding oriented line segments.

32
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:36,710
Which, in essence,
also defines details like

33
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:40,210
how would the translation rotation and
scaling happen on these region.

34
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:43,692
Of course, what that kind of mean is,
now the nose is this direction.

35
00:01:43,692 --> 00:01:45,010
I want to keep that,

36
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:48,640
that nose basically may have shrunk
in size if I draw a line like this.

37
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,000
And if the eye's were smaller,

38
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,210
if I connect these two lines,
the eye's will also get smaller.

39
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:57,500
So in essence, to achieve this,
we will basically now create

40
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:00,510
oriented line segments that
are connecting these regions and

41
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:02,920
giving it a lot more structure.

42
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,620
So now if the eyes were small and

43
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:08,840
these two types of things,
you would notice the difference here.

44
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:12,660
Here, you basically see the line
segment is smaller for the target.

45
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:16,720
And of course, the lips have moved down,
the nose is approximately the same, but

46
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,890
the the tip has moved up.

47
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:20,380
Now, of course, all of this
detail is basically important,

48
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:24,760
because now we can actually do
the image transformations like,

49
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,460
translation, rotation, and scaling,

50
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:30,040
and allows us to have more control how
we want to actually see these things.
