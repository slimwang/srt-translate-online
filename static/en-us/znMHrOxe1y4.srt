00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:05,110
Another type of depression is Seasonal Affective Disorder, or SAD for short.

2
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:08,374
For most individuals, episodes begin in the fall or winter, and then end when

3
00:00:08,374 --> 00:00:12,430
spring arrives. This seems to be due to the reduced levels of life that we

4
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:17,765
experience during winter or colder seasons. For example, I spent most of my

5
00:00:17,765 --> 00:00:21,489
life living in Michigan. And when winter rolls around, not only does it get

6
00:00:21,489 --> 00:00:26,078
very cold, but it gets dark rather quickly as well. And that is not only due to

7
00:00:26,078 --> 00:00:29,555
the shorter days that we experience during winter, but also to the cloudy

8
00:00:29,555 --> 00:00:35,100
weather. We could go for days and days without seeing the sun. Now, I don't

9
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:39,782
think I actually had SAD, but I certainly did experience the winter blues. And

10
00:00:39,782 --> 00:00:43,184
this is a nice example of how we may have some of the symptoms that are similar

11
00:00:43,184 --> 00:00:46,532
to a disorder, but it doesn't necessarily mean we have the actual disorder

12
00:00:46,532 --> 00:00:48,711
itself.
