1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:04,680
Let's assume that the school also kept attendance per grade.

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:09,140
In this case, we've added a third column, grade, to our data.

3
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:13,930
So each row now represents for a given date and a given grade.

4
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:17,800
How many students attended school on that day.

5
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:22,150
Now if d3 or whichever library we're using, they implement some of

6
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:25,770
the principles of the grammar of graphics wasn't so flexible.

7
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:29,460
If we've added another column to our data and

8
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:32,317
it was tightly coupled to how we represented it.

9
00:00:32,317 --> 00:00:37,827
We may have to redo a bunch of work we previously done to draw the same lines,

10
00:00:37,827 --> 00:00:39,780
to draw the same axis's.

11
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:45,840
But in our case, and we'll see later when I go through some live code examples.

12
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,130
Adding another column, or in this case a categorical variable,

13
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,270
allows us to keep a lot of aesthetic and reapply that aesthetic.

14
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:57,680
In this case, three times.

15
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,340
One for each grade.

16
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:02,747
And if our data set had grade 12 in it,

17
00:01:02,747 --> 00:01:08,660
we would have a separate line for 9th, 10th, and 11th grade.

18
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:13,210
Something interesting we see hear is that it appears 10th graders were not

19
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:14,120
affected by the flu.

20
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:17,100
While we have 9th and

21
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:21,860
11th graders with a severe dip in attendance during the later winter months.

22
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:25,660
10th graders, for whatever reason, have seemed to avoided the flu.

23
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:30,840
Due to the flexibility of the grammar of graphics, we were able to apply

24
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:36,700
the same aesthetic, in this case, a line, and the same axes to different data.

25
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:41,970
In this case, data that has a great column added and is categorized by day.

26
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:47,270
So instead of having to redo all the work of specifying how to draw a line.

27
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:49,790
And how it integrates with our data.

28
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:56,100
We simply split up our data by grade and draw in one line for each category.

29
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,230
In this case, the grade
