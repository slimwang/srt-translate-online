1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:04,450
So looking at that we can think about it this way, all right?

2
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:08,500
So, the surface, E of u,v, in this quadratic form,

3
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:12,630
is being approximated essentially by this quadratic or, or

4
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:17,080
sort of parabolic shaped form here, and that's just written the equations out.

5
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:23,870
Now, let's think just for a moment if you were to take a fixed value of E.

6
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:26,490
Okay. So, we're just going to pick some constant value.

7
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:27,170
All right.

8
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:28,610
So, that would look like this.

9
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:29,760
All right.

10
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,210
And here I've written it two ways.

11
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:34,320
I've written it sort of down below in sort of the elegant matrix way,

12
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,500
which we're about to cover up.

13
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,180
because I like inducing pain.

14
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:42,820
And the top way is just the algebraic expression of

15
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:45,030
that expression equal to a constant.

16
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:46,550
And what you can see here is,

17
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:52,040
now you remember, this is the equation of an ellipse in u and v space.

18
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:57,510
All right, so you remember A x squared plus B xy plus C y squared equals D or

19
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:00,780
something like that, was a, was a, was a an ellipse.

20
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:04,379
And if the middle term, the xy term, was 0, it meant that

21
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:08,210
the ellipse's major and minor axes were aligned with the x and y axis?

22
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:09,290
Well, this is the same thing.

23
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:13,090
This is just the, an ellipse in the u v space, all right?

24
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:14,970
So we can draw that out like this, okay?

25
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:20,570
So here is different ellipses for different values of k.

26
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:23,350
So you can think about that the way we're approximating this

27
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:27,720
whole surface is as a quadratic surface that gets bigger and

28
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:31,230
bigger, and each different level is an ellipse.

29
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:33,920
Okay, so that's what you get when you do the type of

30
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,960
second order quadratic Taylor expansion of, of this function.
