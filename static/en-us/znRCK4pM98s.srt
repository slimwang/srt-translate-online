00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,377
In fact, let's do a quiz on MOV Z

2
00:00:02,377 --> 00:00:05,753
and MOV N performance when we do If conversions.

3
00:00:05,753 --> 00:00:08,990
So this is the original code. Let's say that

4
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:12,106
this branch here is 50% of the time taken. So

5
00:00:12,106 --> 00:00:14,059
half of the time we end up doing this,

6
00:00:14,059 --> 00:00:16,800
and half of the time we end up doing this.

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,880
So we can say then that the if conversion

8
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:24,870
code works better, when the prediction accuracy is below, what?

9
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:28,860
Assuming a 30 instruction misprediction penalty for this branch, and assuming

10
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:32,740
of course that this branch is always perfectly predicted, because it's easy.
