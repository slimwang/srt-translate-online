00:00:00,005 --> 00:00:05,298
The MAO inhibitors andtTricyclics were introduced in the late 1950's and early

2
00:00:05,298 --> 00:00:10,662
1960's. They both increase levels of norepinephrine and serotonin. The MAO

3
00:00:10,662 --> 00:00:15,150
inhibitors work by increasing the availability of serotonin, norepinephrine,

4
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:20,237
and dopamine. However, the use of MAOs is limited due to the side effects and

5
00:00:20,237 --> 00:00:25,488
toxicity. That is, users must avoid certain foods and drugs to prevent serious

6
00:00:25,488 --> 00:00:30,440
side effects. One such side effect is a life threatening increase in blood

7
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:35,455
pressure. The tricyclics were discovered when researchers were working to

8
00:00:35,455 --> 00:00:40,070
create a better phenylthiazine antipsychotic and found a drug that improved

9
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:45,011
mood. Although not effective for all patients, they do reduce the severity and

10
00:00:45,011 --> 00:00:50,578
duration of the depressive episodes. The tricyclics include the drug

11
00:00:50,578 --> 00:00:55,130
imipramine, and that drug was discovered accidentally. Some of the tricyclics

12
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:59,540
are also used in the management of chronic pain, for bed wetting, and for the

13
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:03,950
treatment of ADHD, as we saw in the discussion on drugs in our consciousness

14
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:08,570
lesson, drugs can produce side effects and the side effects for the tricyclics

15
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:17,940
include dry mouth, irritability, weight gain, confusion and constipation.
