00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Welcome to Unit 2.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Today we talk about the most important aspect of any statistics person.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I want to quiz you what it is, knowing that you can't know it.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
But I want you to ask you first before I tell you.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
What is the most important thing a statistics person does?

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Look at data? Program computers?

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Run statistics of the type we'll discuss in the future obviously? Or eat tons of pizza?

8
00:00:28,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Just check one of those boxes.
