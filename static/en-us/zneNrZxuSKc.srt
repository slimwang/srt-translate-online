The first sleep disorder we're going to talk about is Sleep Apnea. This is a

2
00:00:04,262 --> 00:00:07,206
condition that results in a person having pauses in breathing while they're

3
00:00:07,206 --> 00:00:13,260
sleeping, or shallow breathing. The pauses can last a few seconds or minutes.

4
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:18,114
This can happen up to 30 times or more an hour. In most cases, a person starts

5
00:00:18,114 --> 00:00:22,466
breathing normally again, however this interruption in sleep causes the person

6
00:00:22,466 --> 00:00:28,106
to go from deep sleep to light sleep. So this in turn results in a poor quality

7
00:00:28,106 --> 00:00:33,372
of sleep. It makes the person tired the next day. This is one of the leading

8
00:00:33,372 --> 00:00:36,635
causes of excessive daytime sleepiness.
