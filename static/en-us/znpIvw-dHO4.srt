1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,330
One track you might want to take in
this course is a track on research.

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:06,500
Research is contributing to
human's broader understanding of

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:07,340
some phenomenon.

4
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:11,370
Or in this class, contributing to our
understanding of education and learning.

5
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:14,560
For example, you might want to
investigate how a particular tool

6
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:15,800
changes the learning process.

7
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:20,070
Or maybe you want to investigate how
different demographics or backgrounds

8
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:23,410
change a person's perceptions of
an online program like this one.

9
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:26,170
But research is very much it's own
language, it's own community and

10
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:29,215
in order to participate in research,
there's a lot you need to understand.

11
00:00:29,215 --> 00:00:32,409
This is going to be a kind of a crash
course in everything you need to do

12
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:34,450
research, at least at
the level we're looking at.

13
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:36,250
We'll talk about some of
the vocabulary of research.

14
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:38,610
We'll talk about validity and
reliability and

15
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:40,500
some of the things you need to
be aware of during research.

16
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,940
And especially, we'll talk about
different research designs.

17
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:45,850
How to set up an experiment or
set up some research that

18
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:48,536
will actually answer the questions
that you want to answer.
