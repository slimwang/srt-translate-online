1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:03,080
In this unit you'll cover videos
from a couple different courses.

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:05,830
You'll look at some videos from
Sebastian Rune's Introduction to

3
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:08,080
Machine Learning course,
produced here at Udacity.

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,750
And you'll also look at some videos from
Georgia Tech's Machine Learning course

5
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:13,930
with Charles Isabelle and
Michael Litman.

6
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:16,740
Along the way you'll cover several
methods for doing supervised learning

7
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:19,590
like neural networks, ensemble learning,
regression, classification.

8
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:23,110
These are different ways of
approaching supervised learning.

9
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:26,790
One of the main learning goals here is
to be able to evaluate those different

10
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:29,490
methods and test whether or
not they're the best idea for

11
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:30,560
a certain incoming data set.

12
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,360
And so those are really the two
dual learning goals for this unit.

13
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:37,730
We want you to understand how to apply
these methods, but we also want you to

14
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:40,690
understand how to evaluate when
you should apply each method.
