00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,534
Now that we've seen how to simplify rational expressions, let's use that

2
00:00:03,534 --> 00:00:07,220
knowledge to help us multiply and divide them. But before we can multiply and

3
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:11,304
divide rational expressions, let's think back how to multiply fractions. What

4
00:00:11,304 --> 00:00:15,770
would you get if you multiplied these two fractions together? Write your answer

00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:16,183
here.
