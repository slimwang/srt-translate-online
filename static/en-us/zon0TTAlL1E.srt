00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
[Evans] So if you recall the separate channels, we divided the cipher

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
into the message part, the key part, and the part from the S wheels,

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and now we've concluded that if we can--

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
we're going to try 1271 possible settings.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
So for 1 of those possible settings we're going to know all the key bits,

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
and that means if we guess the right setting the key will go to 0.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
So now all that's left is the other 2 parts.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
This is what we had before.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
We knew that the probability of delta M being zero was greater than a half,

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
and it was actually about 0.61 for German

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
because of the likelihood of message letters being repeated.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
And we knew that the probability of delta S being 0 was about 0.73,

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
and that's because of the structure of the machine--

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
that the S wheels don't advance every step.

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Only when the M wheels are on a 1 do the S wheels advance.

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:01,000
And so now we've said if we guess right, that means the probability that the key bits are 0

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
goes to 1.

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
And it'll be 1 when we guess right.

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
When we don't guess right it'll be ½.

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
So in order to tell if we guess right,

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
we need to know that the probability of the cipher text bits when we guess right,

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
the probability of the delta Zs being 0 will be different from ½.

23
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
So the question is, what is the probability delta Z is 0 when we guess right?

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:35,000
And remember that what delta Z is is the XOR of delta M, delta K, and delta S.

25
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
So to solve this you need to think about all the different things

26
00:01:38,000 --> 99:59:59,999
that would make delta Z equal to 0 and compute their probability.
