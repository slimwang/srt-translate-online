1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:01,700
So you understand focus and

2
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:05,910
you understand semantics,
two crucial pillars of accessibility.

3
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:08,595
To wrap things up, let's spend
some time talking about styling.

4
00:00:08,595 --> 00:00:11,500
Now this is a broad topic,
but I'm going to try and

5
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:14,800
segment it into a few important areas.

6
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:18,198
The first is ensuring that our elements
are styled to support the accessibility

7
00:00:18,198 --> 00:00:19,678
of work that we've already done.

8
00:00:19,678 --> 00:00:24,210
This means adding styles for
focus and various ARIA states.

9
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:27,864
Once you've got that squared away,
we can look at how to make sure our

10
00:00:27,864 --> 00:00:31,140
UIs are flexible, and
can handle being zoomed or scaled up for

11
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,801
users who may have trouble
reading smaller text.

12
00:00:33,801 --> 00:00:37,932
Lastly, I'll talk about color choices,
look at the importance of contrast and

13
00:00:37,932 --> 00:00:41,410
making sure we're not conveying
information with color, alone.

14
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:43,860
So there's a lot to cover.

15
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:44,360
Let's get started.
