1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,755
We saw in the previous morsel that
the use of timeslices delivers certain

2
00:00:03,755 --> 00:00:04,353
benefits.

3
00:00:04,353 --> 00:00:08,859
We're able to start the execution of
tasks sooner, and therefore, we are able

4
00:00:08,859 --> 00:00:12,770
to achieve an overall schedule of
the task that's more responsive.

5
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:15,388
But that came with certain overheads.

6
00:00:15,388 --> 00:00:20,008
So the balance between these two
is going to imply something about

7
00:00:20,008 --> 00:00:22,109
the length of the timeslice.

8
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:26,789
We will see that to answer this
question, how long should a timeslice

9
00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:32,113
be, the balance between these two
differs if we're considering I/O-bound

10
00:00:32,113 --> 00:00:37,760
tasks, so tasks that mostly perform I/O
operations, versus CPU-bound tasks,

11
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:42,196
so tasks, these are tasks that
are mostly executing on the CPU and

12
00:00:42,196 --> 00:00:45,056
don't do any I/O or do very little I/O.

13
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:47,995
We will look at these two
different scenarios next.
