1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,819
With a depth limit of 2 we get a very
different result than with a limit of 3.

2
00:00:03,819 --> 00:00:07,179
>> Yep,
at level 2 the losing center moves.

3
00:00:07,179 --> 00:00:11,419
Both have scores of 3, while
the winning moves have smaller scores.

4
00:00:11,419 --> 00:00:14,050
>> Does that mean our
evaluation function is bad?

5
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:15,440
>> Not necessarily.

6
00:00:15,439 --> 00:00:19,050
It may mean that we are not searching
deep enough to get good answers.

7
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:20,039
>> How do we tell?

8
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:23,469
>> One way to check is to see which
branch is the Minimax algorithm

9
00:00:23,469 --> 00:00:25,304
recommends at each level of the search.

10
00:00:25,304 --> 00:00:28,839
If the results vary widely
between certain levels,

11
00:00:28,839 --> 00:00:33,019
it may be because a critical decision
is being made at those levels.

12
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:35,220
Let's try it out on
the example isolation game.

13
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:39,429
We will continue to use the number
of my moves evaluation function,

14
00:00:39,429 --> 00:00:43,140
which can have a maximum score of 5 and
a minimum score of 0.

15
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:45,984
If we find a branch where
our computer player loses,

16
00:00:45,984 --> 00:00:48,250
we'll give it a score of negative 1.

17
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:51,020
If we find a branch where
our computer player wins,

18
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:52,220
we'll give it a score of 100.

19
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:57,149
With this example isolation game at
level 1, the number of mime moves of

20
00:00:57,149 --> 00:01:00,560
the valuation function would
recommend the two center moves, and

21
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,990
the top left move.

22
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:03,719
Each of these have scores of 4.

23
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:07,840
By level 2, the two center moves are
considered the best with scores of 3.

24
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,790
At level 3 the center moves
are considered worst.

25
00:01:13,829 --> 00:01:18,605
that continues for level 4,

26
00:01:18,605 --> 00:01:22,609
5 and 6.

27
00:01:22,609 --> 00:01:25,780
After level 3,
we've reached a state of quiescence.

28
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:28,329
The recommended branches
are not changing much.

29
00:01:28,329 --> 00:01:29,719
We know we are in good shape.
