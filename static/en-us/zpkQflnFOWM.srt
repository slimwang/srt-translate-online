1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
So we just learned how to do that JavaScript token

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
in lexical analysis.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Now we need to know how to handle that special

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
JavaScript token.type when we're parsing.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Just to review a bit,

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
this is how we did basic HTML parsing

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
or our basic HTML grammar.

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
We say it's a parsing rule, with p_.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
This is the kind of thing we're trying to parse--an element--

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
and then we write down here, the rule from the grammar,

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
and where we would normally write an arrow, they ask us to write a colon.

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
So element can be rewritten to word.

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
And then p[0] is the final parse tree.

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
And p[1] is the child parse tree.

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
And we build the final parse tree out of the child parse tree,

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
growing a bigger tree, over time.

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Well--actually, our handling of JavaScript elements is very similar.

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
We just indicate that an HTML element

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
can consist of a JavaScript token,

20
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
and we build up our parse tree by

21
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
noting that it's a JavaScript token

22
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
and then including the text.

23
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
And you see this word here--JAVASCRIPT--in all capital letters.

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Back here, when we were lexing the JavaScript token,

25
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
we said: token.type is JAVASCRIPT, in all capital letters.

26
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Those intentionally match.

27
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
This is the linkage we're making between the lexer and the parser.

28
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
In fact, they have to match; otherwise, it won't work.

29
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
So let me show you a concrete example.

30
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Let's say my HTML input is: hello my

31
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
and then there's some 'javascript' which says:

32
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
document.write (99);

33
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
and then "luft ballons".

34
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Let me show you what the Abstract Syntax Tree--

35
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
or what the parse tree--will look like for this.

36
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
And we'll recall that HTML is a list of elements,

37
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
and here we have 4 elements: 1, 2, 3, 4.

38
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
The first is the word_element, hello.

39
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
The next is the word_element, my.

40
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
The next is the javascript_element containing

41
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
only the important text--

42
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
not all of this tag stuff.

43
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
And the last is the word_element, luftballons.

44
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
This is the parse tree, a list of HTML elements.

45
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
It just so happens that none of these are nested,

46
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
but they could have been if there were some tags in here.

47
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
And here: 99 luftballons

48
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
is perhaps more commonly known as--

49
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
in English--as 99 Red Balloons.

50
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
It was a protest song, in German,

51
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
written around 1983.

52
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Here are, clearly, 99 entire balloons.

53
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
It must be that the other 95 are just behind this one--

54
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
exactly covered by it.

55
00:02:19,000 --> 99:59:59,999
You believe me, don't you? You totally don't.
