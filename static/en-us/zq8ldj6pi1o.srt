Thanks Fredo! So, like old times, we're going to

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:05,800
need to ask for permission. Go ahead and change

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:08,960
the Android Manifest file, to request the Internet permission.

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,730
And then tell us the exact string name of

5
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:14,380
the permission that you used. Run the app

6
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:16,760
again, to ensure that it doesn't crash. You can

7
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:19,070
also log the output of the network call, to

8
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:21,530
verify that you got the weather data back correctly.
