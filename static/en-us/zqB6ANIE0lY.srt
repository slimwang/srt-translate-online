1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:05,191
The degrees of freedom for between group variability is k minus 1. If we add

2
00:00:05,191 --> 00:00:09,768
this to the degrees of freedom for within group variability. And then we do a

3
00:00:09,768 --> 00:00:14,374
little bit of switching around. We get that the k's cancel each other out. And

4
00:00:14,374 --> 00:00:20,000
we're left with n minus 1. This is our total degrees of freedom. You learned

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,649
before that the degrees of freedom is the sample size minus one. Well, this is

6
00:00:24,649 --> 00:00:29,010
the total number of values in all the samples. And we subtract 1 to get the

7
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:31,100
total degrees of freedom.
