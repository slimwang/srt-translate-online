1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,469
Let's also do a quiz
about the miss rate.

2
00:00:02,469 --> 00:00:06,680
Keep in mind that the hit rate is
equal to one minus the miss rate.

3
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:10,310
The miss rate is how often
do we have a cash miss.

4
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:14,005
The hit rate is how often
do we have a cash hit, and

5
00:00:14,005 --> 00:00:18,155
the two adapt to one because we
either have one or the other.

6
00:00:18,155 --> 00:00:21,628
So which of the following are true for
a well designed cache?

7
00:00:21,628 --> 00:00:25,105
Is it true that in a well designed cache
the hit rate should be larger than

8
00:00:25,105 --> 00:00:29,425
the miss rate, the hit rate should
be less than the miss rate,

9
00:00:29,425 --> 00:00:34,075
that the hit and the miss rate should be
balanced, as close to equal as possible,

10
00:00:34,075 --> 00:00:38,450
that the hit rate should be almost one,
that the miss rate should be almost one?

11
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:42,940
Again, more than one, possibly all,
possibly none of them might be true, so

12
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:45,680
check all of those that are true for
a well designed cache.
