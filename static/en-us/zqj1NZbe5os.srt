00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:06,660
Our z score is 1.89, which is less than a z score, 1.96. Therefore, our sample

2
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:11,522
mean will fall somewhere in this white region. One of the 95% of sample means

3
00:00:11,522 --> 00:00:16,558
surrounding the population mean. Therefore, we fail to reject the Ho or the

4
00:00:16,558 --> 00:00:21,620
null hypothesis. There's not enough evidence that the new population parameter,

5
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:27,000
will be significantly different from what it is now. After we implement this

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,298
musical lesson. In other words, we would guess that engagement will stay the

7
00:00:31,298 --> 00:00:33,573
same based on our sample.
