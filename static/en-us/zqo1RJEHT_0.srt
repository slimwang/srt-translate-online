1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
So, here is our normal distribution again.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I'm going to write it as "exp" for exponential {-½ (x - µ)²/σ²}.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
The truth is when you're new to this this looks really cryptic.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
When you're with statistics for many years as I have been,

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
you wake up in the middle of the night and you can recite this formula.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
It's as normal as getting breakfast in the morning or having a beer after dinner.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
What I want to get into your brains is not the complexity of the formula.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I want you to really understand how this formula is constructed.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I you to understand the quadratic penalty term of deviations from the expectation

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
of the mean of this expression.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Then the exponential that squeezes it back into the curves.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
That's basically what it is.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
We can draw values from this normal distribution just the same way as we flipped coins before.

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
The way to look at this is any value x has this probability up here.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
This is nothing else but a notation of the probability of x for a normal distribution with µ and σ².

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:09,000
So, a value x that has twice the high bar than some other value x'

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
will have twice as much of a probability of being drawn.

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Now, obviously, the normal has an entire continuous space of outcomes.

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
And obviously that renders each individual outcome of probability 0.

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
But, in essence, you can think of the height of this thing over here

21
00:01:27,000 --> 99:59:59,999
as being proportional to the probability that this value is being drawn.
