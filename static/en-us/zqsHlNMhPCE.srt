1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,400
We'll illustrate
the distinction between P and

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:06,120
NP by trying to analyze a world
of friends and enemies.

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:08,390
By the way, Lance gets credit for
this example.

4
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:10,940
His daughters were the right age for
the Twilight movie when it came out.

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,210
Everyone in this world is
either a friend or an enemy.

6
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:18,930
And we'll represent this by drawing
an edge between all the friends like so.

7
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,490
Given all this information,

8
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:24,570
there are several types of analysis
that you might want to do.

9
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:26,660
Some easier and some harder.

10
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:27,540
For instance,

11
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:31,260
if you wanted to run a dating service,
you'd be in pretty good shape.

12
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:34,720
Say that you wanted to maximize the
number of matches that you could make

13
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:37,290
and enhance the number
of happy customers.

14
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:41,220
Or perhaps you just want to know if
it's possible to get everyone a date.

15
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:43,560
Well, we have efficient algorithms for
finding matching,

16
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:46,320
and we'll see some in a future lesson.

17
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,840
Here in this example,
it's possible to match everyone up, and

18
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,480
such a matching is fairly easy to find.

19
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,990
Contrast this with the problem
of identifying cliques.

20
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:59,300
By clique I mean a set of people who
are all friends with each other.

21
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:02,570
For instance,
here is a clique of size three.

22
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:04,870
Every pair of members
has an edge between.

23
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:08,400
And cliques of that size
aren't too hard to find.

24
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:12,450
As we look for larger cliques, however,
the problem becomes harder and

25
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:13,160
harder to solve.
