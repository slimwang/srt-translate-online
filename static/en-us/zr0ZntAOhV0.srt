1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,290
So let's see if we can figure out what kind

2
00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:05,060
of atomic instruction do we need. So we want to

3
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:08,080
implement locks easily. And for that, we need what type

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,400
of instruction? We need a load that reads memory, or we

5
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,060
need a store that writes memory, or we need an

6
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:17,630
instruction that both reads and writes memory, or we need an

7
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:21,638
instruction that doesn't access memory at all. So what do

8
00:00:21,638 --> 00:00:25,664
we need in order to implement locks relatively easily without resorting

9
00:00:25,664 --> 00:00:27,330
to complicated algorithms?
