00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:05,684
This equation represents an ellipse. We want to move this negative 4 y squared

2
00:00:05,684 --> 00:00:10,459
term to the left hand side of the equation. So we'll add 4 y squared here and

3
00:00:10,459 --> 00:00:16,045
we'll add 4 y squared here. So we'll be left with 27 on the right hand side.

4
00:00:16,045 --> 00:00:20,758
And 3 x squared plus 4 y squared on the left hand side. We have addition

5
00:00:20,758 --> 00:00:24,644
between x squared and y squared, so we know we have either a circle or an

6
00:00:24,644 --> 00:00:29,635
ellipse. And since, we have different amounts of x squared and y squared, we

7
00:00:29,635 --> 00:00:34,006
know we have an ellipse. And just to check in Desmos, I'll show you that this

8
00:00:34,006 --> 00:00:35,970
graph is exactly the same.
