1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:03,400
So far we've learned how
to create simple shapes.

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:05,340
But of course,

3
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:08,700
you want to build VR experiences
with more than just primitives.

4
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:14,420
You want interesting, elaborate, 3D
models with color and animation, right?

5
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:18,190
Unity makes it easy to use meshes
of any shape you can imagine.

6
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:21,190
Check out this rad model.

7
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:22,740
Unity can totally handle this guy.

8
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:27,560
But Unity does not provide you with
tools to create those kinds of models.

9
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:32,380
You have to create them in another
program like Blender or Maya, or

10
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:37,130
you can download them from
the Internet or the Unity Asset Store.

11
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:39,901
Unity cleanly separates itself for

12
00:00:39,901 --> 00:00:45,726
digital content creation tools like
Maya, 3D Studio, Modo or Blender.

13
00:00:45,726 --> 00:00:48,811
That means you have to learn one of
those programs if you want to make

14
00:00:48,811 --> 00:00:51,840
complicated models for
use in your VR worlds.

15
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,950
It turns out this was a really
smart decision by the Unity team

16
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:58,580
that made it much easier to learn.

17
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:03,275
Unity doesn't handle 3D modeling,
texturing, character rigging, etc,

18
00:01:03,275 --> 00:01:06,630
etc, instead it's a master
of assembling 3D scenes.

19
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:11,947
Let's look at how simple it is to
import a complex model into Unity.
