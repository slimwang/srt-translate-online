00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,556
There are other points above this line that represent saving more than $100 per

2
00:00:05,556 --> 00:00:11,174
month. For example, after 1 month, I could have also saved $400 or after 1 month

3
00:00:11,174 --> 00:00:16,672
I could have also saved $450 or even $500. Similar reasoning could be used at 2

4
00:00:16,672 --> 00:00:22,238
months, I could have saved maybe $600. Or 700, so there's tons of points farther

5
00:00:22,238 --> 00:00:27,115
above this region. Because all these y values are the amount of money saved

6
00:00:27,115 --> 00:00:32,218
falls above this line, we can change our equation into an inequality. We want

7
00:00:32,218 --> 00:00:37,353
our savings amount to be greater than the exact amount of $200 plus the $100 per

8
00:00:37,353 --> 00:00:42,919
month. So this is the inequality we can write. Notice that linear inequalities

9
00:00:42,919 --> 00:00:48,466
contain 2 variables, just like linear equations. This allows us to find a point,

10
00:00:48,466 --> 00:00:53,693
x and y, that satisfies this condition. For example I can use this point and

11
00:00:53,693 --> 00:00:58,969
plug in 2 for x and 500 for y and I should get a true statement. And when I do,

12
00:00:58,969 --> 00:01:04,397
I get 500 is greater than 400, so yes this is true. Also remember from before,

13
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:09,875
we said that one 300 couldn't be a point for our inequality. We didn't save more

14
00:01:09,875 --> 00:01:15,176
than $100 per month. So I need some way to represent that on the line. I can't

15
00:01:15,176 --> 00:01:20,384
actually include the points on the line, so I'm going to use a dashed line to

16
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:25,527
exclude them. We know any of the points above this line satisfy our inequality.

17
00:01:25,527 --> 00:01:30,343
This shaded reason up above would represent every instance when we saved more

18
00:01:30,343 --> 00:01:34,996
than $100 in a month. Let's say you allowed yourself to save exactly $100 or

19
00:01:34,996 --> 00:01:39,786
more per month. So now we could be greater than or equal to. Well, this point

20
00:01:39,786 --> 00:01:44,607
can now be a point on our line. If you allow yourself to save exactly $100 or

21
00:01:44,607 --> 00:01:49,457
more in a month then now we can include this point in our inequality. We can see

22
00:01:49,457 --> 00:01:54,273
that by plugging it in we get a true statement. 300 is greater than or equal to

23
00:01:54,273 --> 00:01:59,083
300. I need to change my graph to reflect that so, instead of using a dash line

24
00:01:59,083 --> 00:02:04,876
I'll use a solid one. That will represent the equal to part. When graphing

25
00:02:04,876 --> 00:02:11,311
linear inequalities, we use a solid line for greater than or equal to, and less

26
00:02:11,311 --> 00:02:17,551
than or equal to. If we see the greater than or the less than sign, then we use

27
00:02:17,551 --> 00:02:18,794
a dashed line.
