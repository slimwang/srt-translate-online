1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,919
Let's open exercise four,
Wiring up RecyclerView.

2
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:06,390
Now we've created all
the individual pieces.

3
00:00:06,389 --> 00:00:08,349
All that remains is to
connect them all together.

4
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:11,970
Everything we need to do is
in our main activity file.

5
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:16,250
After creating a static variable
indicating the number of views we

6
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:18,896
want our view to hold,
we need number variables for

7
00:00:18,896 --> 00:00:21,289
our GreenAdapter and RecyclerView.

8
00:00:21,289 --> 00:00:22,559
In our on create method,

9
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:26,570
we need to get a reference to our
RecyclerView using findViewById.

10
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:29,440
We will use this reference
to assign a layout manager,

11
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,150
in our case a LinearLayoutManager.

12
00:00:31,149 --> 00:00:33,277
And after instantiating
the GreenAdapter,

13
00:00:33,277 --> 00:00:35,820
assign it to the RecyclerView as well.

14
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:39,325
Assign setHasFixedSize to true
allows RecyclerView to do some

15
00:00:39,325 --> 00:00:42,100
optimizations on our UI,
namely, allowing it to

16
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:46,609
avoid invalidating the whole layout
when adapter contents change.

17
00:00:46,609 --> 00:00:48,780
We then create a new GreenAdapter and

18
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:51,719
store it in our mAdapter
member variable.

19
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:55,379
Finally, we connect the GreenAdapter
we just created to the RecyclerView

20
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:56,640
with a setAdapter method.
