00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:30,450
>> For every element in Y, if there exists an element that

2
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:36,510
is after it, then that element must be greater than or

3
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:43,250
equal to the current element we're looking at. Almost there, okay.

4
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:48,970
you, what, Jarrod did is he broke the specification into two parts.

5
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:54,050
One part is all the elements except the last one. And he, he stated exactly what

6
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:57,440
the post-conditions is for that. But he didn't say anything about the last one.

7
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:01,500
Okay, so if we wanted to have a precise specification, we'd have to deal with,

8
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:06,470
with that one as well. Okay? Now, it turn out in this particular case that we

9
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:11,820
can do a little proof in our head. To say that if the post condition that

10
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:17,050
he specified for all the other element is true, that implies that the last one

11
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:20,570
must be the greatest one. So, we could get we could get away with that, and

12
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:26,830
in fact that's a pretty nice, clean way of expressing it. Notice,

13
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:32,360
also, that Jared used the word" for each," and when you hear that phrase,

14
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:36,530
it's suggestive of, in our first-order logic,

15
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:40,210
of one of those quantifiers that I mentioned, the universal quantifier, for

16
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:45,520
each or for all. And so we're going to, we're going to see when we specify

17
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,190
this in first order logic that that, that quantifier is going to be there.

18
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:55,190
First order logic when we introduce a quantifier at the same time that,

19
00:01:55,190 --> 00:02:00,600
or, when we use the quantifier at the same time we introduce a variable which is

20
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:05,710
going to stand for the typical element of the vector. Okay, so

21
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:11,670
for each i where i is going to be an index position into y,

22
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:17,610
then we can say something about the value that's held in position i and

23
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:22,750
the position i plus one Okay? So, the quantifier for each has a variable

24
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:27,230
that comes with it we can call it i or j or whatever you would like.
