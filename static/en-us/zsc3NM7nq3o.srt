1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Now, if I tell you the point value of every letter.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I'm creating a dictionary with the point values.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I'm using underscore to indicate the blank, but we won't be dealing with blanks yet.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Now, I'd like you to write the function word_score for me,

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
which takes a word--a sequence of letters--and tells me the total score for it

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
according to the points of each letter,

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
and it's not dealing with any bonuses on the board--

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
any double letters, or triple words, or anything.
