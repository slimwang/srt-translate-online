00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:04,200
Okay, so when I press this button I see
that the Firebase database updated to

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:05,040
have the data.

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,340
Now this is actually a pretty complex
thing that just happened here.

4
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:12,160
Notice how I didn't need to make
a new AsyncTask or start a background

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:16,170
thread or anything fancy like that,
Firebase does it all for us.

6
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:19,530
And I'll actually go ahead and
put my app on another phone.

7
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:22,705
And I can actually make
a new list with this.

8
00:00:22,705 --> 00:00:25,845
[BLANK_AUDIO]

9
00:00:25,845 --> 00:00:27,740
Press the Create button.

10
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:30,440
And I see it's also all
contacting Firebase.

11
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,720
Now right now,
we're just writing data to Firebase.

12
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:33,830
We're not reading data yet.

13
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,545
So even after the change happens
here I'm not seeing it in my app.

14
00:00:39,545 --> 00:00:40,530
We'll fix that a bit.

15
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:43,440
But first, let's learn a little
bit more about data and Firebase
