1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:05,830
My first pitch meeting was with
an Angel investor called Owen.

2
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:10,340
And I gave the pitch of my life and
he was convinced.

3
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:12,630
I felt that he fell for me.

4
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:16,180
And in the second meeting I brought
my team members and he said,

5
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:18,510
yeah, amazing, let's do it.

6
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:23,180
And somewhere in doing
the meeting he told me Norm,

7
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:27,260
I have a feeling that you have
a feeling that I'm in your pocket.

8
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:28,620
You know what?

9
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:31,370
Let's stop it right there.

10
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:34,560
You go and get five more investors

11
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:37,580
to give the same amount of money
that I'm going to give you.

12
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:38,560
And then I'll give you my money.

13
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:39,970
What do you say about that?

14
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,720
And I said, what?

15
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,070
Really?

16
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:45,580
Why?

17
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:47,440
I thought,
I thought if we're doing this.

18
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:52,050
No, no, I want more people to
participate in this round.

19
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:52,950
And you know what?

20
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:57,680
I want you to bring in an engine
with the whole Gigi level.

21
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,550
And that time and

22
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:04,560
still, Gigi Levy was the most
notable engine investor in Israel.

23
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:09,230
And Gigi was like a celebrity for
me, I don't know him.

24
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:10,680
He said, yeah, go do that.

25
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,500
Go do that, that will be your test.

26
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:18,180
And I went from that meeting with
my team members somewhere between

27
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:24,380
humiliated to disappointed,
to what's going on?

28
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:26,610
I really thought that we're
going to start operating.

29
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:33,960
But not, so the next day I
just like this isn't fart,

30
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,060
how I'm going to
approach this person and

31
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:40,770
I was so
I was the hokiest of the hokies.

32
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:43,060
And I didn't know anyone.

33
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:50,710
So my best chance was just to Facebook
message this Angel [COUGH] sorry.

34
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:53,550
So my best chance was to Facebook
message this angel investor.

35
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:54,830
And this is a huge no-no.

36
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:56,790
Everybody will tell you,
this is so hood.

37
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:57,690
Don't do it.

38
00:01:57,690 --> 00:02:00,060
It's so amateur, it's so unprofessional.

39
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:03,630
But I did it, and
he answered right away.

40
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:05,210
Three days later we had a meeting.

41
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:07,300
We had an amazing meeting.

42
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:10,440
And he decided to invest and

43
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:15,140
this guy became my mentor he became
one of my favorite person on Earth.

44
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:20,990
And he invested not once, not twice,
four times in my companies.

45
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:24,910
And now he's following,
he followed us to the next company.

46
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:28,120
And yes, I'm excited to talk about him.
