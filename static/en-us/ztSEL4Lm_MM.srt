00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:05,442
Here, the equation we can write is 200 divided by x minus 10 equals 240 divided

2
00:00:05,442 --> 00:00:12,853
by x. Great thinking if you found this equation. The key is that the bus can

3
00:00:12,853 --> 00:00:18,950
travel 200 miles in the same amount of time that the van can travel 240 miles.

4
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:23,476
So, this time, for the bus to travel 200 miles has to be equal to this time for

5
00:00:23,476 --> 00:00:26,890
the van to travel 240 miles.
