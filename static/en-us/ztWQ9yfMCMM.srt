00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,855
>> The first step we need to take, and this is actually a little bit tricky, is

2
00:00:03,855 --> 00:00:07,949
to recognize that we have a term of 24x squared on both sides of the equation.

3
00:00:07,949 --> 00:00:12,161
That means, if we subtracted from both sides, we'll just get rid of it entirely.

4
00:00:12,161 --> 00:00:16,315
That's definitely going to make our lives simpler. Now, I'm going to move all of

5
00:00:16,315 --> 00:00:20,262
my x terms, so that they're on the left side of the equation. And all of my

6
00:00:20,262 --> 00:00:25,119
constant terms, so that they're on the right. All that's left to do is divide

7
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:29,885
both sides by 60. Recognizing that 38 and 60 are both divisible by 2, we can

8
00:00:29,885 --> 00:00:34,748
cancel out that common factor, and get a final answer of x equals 19 over 30.

9
00:00:34,748 --> 00:00:39,990
Awesome. I know that was a really, pretty intricate and complicated equation to

10
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:44,114
solve. But look at where we came from. We started off with all of these messy

11
00:00:44,114 --> 00:00:48,079
fractions, and we ended up with, well, an answer that is a fraction, but it's an

12
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:52,192
answer nonetheless. I'd like you to plug this answer into the places of x in the

13
00:00:52,192 --> 00:00:56,590
original equation, to make sure that it actually works. Please remember to check

14
00:00:56,590 --> 00:01:00,425
the left hand side on its own, and the right hand side on its own, and then

15
00:01:00,425 --> 00:01:01,340
compare the two.
