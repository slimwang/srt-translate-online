00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,949
Now, that we've talked about what an equation really is and what types of

2
00:00:03,961 --> 00:00:08,192
equations there are, let's actually build some up. To do that, we're going to

3
00:00:08,204 --> 00:00:12,640
keep helping Grant deal with his manufacturing process. Since Grant's Gleaming

4
00:00:12,652 --> 00:00:17,132
Glasses has started manufacturing now, they actually have to pay for things,

5
00:00:17,242 --> 00:00:22,375
namely, the materials they use to make glasses wipers and nozzles. To buy just

6
00:00:22,387 --> 00:00:27,520
the material that he needed to make the wipers that were produced in the first 4

7
00:00:27,532 --> 00:00:32,640
days, Grant spent $598. He's thinking that next week, he'll need to spend around

8
00:00:32,652 --> 00:00:37,773
$750 to start the nozzle manufacturing process. We know from that chart we made

9
00:00:37,785 --> 00:00:41,921
earlier, that he was able to make 92 glasses wipers in the first 4 days. Oh, and

10
00:00:41,933 --> 00:00:45,734
he also told me that he took his friends out to lunch and he spent 54 more

11
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:49,864
dollars on that. To plan for the future, Grant is getting a little bit worried.

12
00:00:49,958 --> 00:00:54,044
There are a lot of different numbers he needs to keep track of. He wants to know

13
00:00:54,056 --> 00:00:58,028
how much he spends on the materials to make just one set of wiper blades, but he

14
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:00,533
needs our help to sift through all these numbers.
