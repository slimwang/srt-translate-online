00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:05,160
So as usual, you're going to be using
a Google API Client and in your OnCreate

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:08,650
function you'll build it, and in your
OnStart function, you'll connect it.

3
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:13,940
When you're connecting to the signin
APIs, a number of things can happen.

4
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:18,530
First of all, it will generate an error
if you haven't chosen an account, so

5
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:21,330
if your device has
multiple accounts on it,

6
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:25,160
you'll see a dialogue pops up
asking me to choose which account.

7
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:29,350
Once that dialogue has been accepted,
the sign in connection will continue.

8
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:32,650
They can then throw another
error to give you permission.

9
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:35,790
So the first time you're running this
you'll see that consent dialogue and

10
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:39,490
you'll stay in this error state
until consent has been given.

11
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:42,650
If you refuse to consent,
then the connection will fail, and

12
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:45,470
you'll go directly to
OnConnectionFailed.

13
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:48,130
If you give the consent,
then the sign in will continue,

14
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:52,390
and if all else works, you'll end
up in your OnConnected function.

15
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:54,270
So you'll need to implement
your OnConnected, and

16
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:57,580
your OnConnectionFailed, and
you'll need to catch these errors.

17
00:00:57,580 --> 00:00:59,120
It can get complicated really quickly.

18
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,920
But you'll see how to do that
over the next few steps, and

19
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,170
we'll go through this step by step.
