1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:05,022
So, in general, if the case of two calibrated cameras.

2
00:00:05,022 --> 00:00:09,302
We had talked about parallel optical axes, all right.

3
00:00:09,302 --> 00:00:11,730
So that they were lined up and the parallel, and

4
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:16,360
the planes were, were coplanar, but of course, they can be what's called verged.

5
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:19,460
They could be pointed in some particular way.

6
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:22,640
In fact, they don't even have to necessarily be verged on the same point.

7
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,070
Usually they are because we're used to human systems.

8
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:28,620
But what we're going to do is we're going to talk about epipolar geometry,

9
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:32,049
the epipolar constraint in both of these cases.

10
00:00:32,049 --> 00:00:33,362
So let's start it this way.

11
00:00:33,362 --> 00:00:39,191
So if I have an image on the left and some point p projecting in that image,

12
00:00:39,191 --> 00:00:45,350
the question is where can p prime the image of that same point on the right be?

13
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:49,330
Well, basically the actual scene point could be

14
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:54,240
anywhere along the ray that contains p prime.

15
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:58,250
Each of these red dots correspond to possible locations along that

16
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:01,740
ray of the actual scene point that's projecting to p prime.

17
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,989
Now remember, in perspective projection,

18
00:01:04,989 --> 00:01:08,910
one of the things we said was that lines project into lines.

19
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:14,560
So the line containing the center of projection and

20
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:19,497
the ray that goes through that point, that's a real line in space, okay?

21
00:01:19,497 --> 00:01:26,980
That line mu, in, must project into a line in the right image.

22
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:29,190
So that's the constraint we are going to talk more about.
