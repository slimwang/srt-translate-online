We've worked with frosted cake, but sometimes it might be better to know how

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:08,292
much cake was not frosted. Let's look at a simple case of this. If 2 3rds of a

3
00:00:08,304 --> 00:00:12,657
cake is frosted with vanilla icing, what fraction is not frosted? Well, let's

4
00:00:12,669 --> 00:00:16,864
start off by looking at a cake. Here is a whole chocolate cake and I'm going to

5
00:00:16,876 --> 00:00:21,781
ice 2 3rds of it. So I've split my cake up into 3rds and I iced two of those

6
00:00:21,793 --> 00:00:26,538
3rds. Here is 1 3rds and 2 3rds. One way to think about this is that the parts

7
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:31,168
must add up to the whole. I know that I have 2 3rds of the cake frosted in

8
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:36,196
vanilla icing and I have to add some amount to get a whole cake. So I know 2

9
00:00:36,208 --> 00:00:41,149
3rds plus some amount has to equal one. Well, this last piece is just 1 3rd, so

10
00:00:41,161 --> 00:00:46,198
I can just put 1 3rd here. This is the amount that's not frosted. And remember

11
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:51,272
back from adding fractions, we know we just need to count up the 3rds. I have 1

12
00:00:51,284 --> 00:00:56,371
3rd, 2 3rds, and 3 3rds altogether. So, this piece that's not frosted is 1 3rd.

13
00:00:56,672 --> 00:01:00,904
There's actually another way that we can think about this. Let's instead start

14
00:01:00,916 --> 00:01:05,046
with a whole cake and subtract off the parts that we don't want. We don't want

15
00:01:05,058 --> 00:01:09,197
the vanilla icing. So let's subtract the pieces we don't want from the entire

16
00:01:09,209 --> 00:01:13,668
whole cake. I started with one whole cake and I'm subtracting off 2 3rds. Well,

17
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,130
I know one whole cake is the same thing as 3 3rds. Remember, I can write one as

18
00:01:18,142 --> 00:01:22,577
1 divided by 1, beecause that's still one., and then I can multiply this

19
00:01:22,589 --> 00:01:26,996
fraction by 3 over 3. I'm just going to turn one into 3rds or 3 3rds, so I have

20
00:01:27,008 --> 00:01:30,974
3 3rds minus 2 3rds which is 1 3rd. 1 3rd of my cake is not frosted. And what's

21
00:01:30,986 --> 00:01:35,180
interesting about fractions is that it doesn't matter how much cake we're

22
00:01:35,192 --> 00:01:39,587
talking about. We could have started with a different cake, maybe we started

23
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:43,926
with a rectangular cake. Here is a rectangular cake and I'm going to ice 2 3rds

24
00:01:44,143 --> 00:01:48,385
of it. Doing the same problem with the rectangular cake doesn't change my

25
00:01:48,397 --> 00:01:52,650
answer. I still have 2 3rds of it frosted in vanilla icing and 1 3rd that's left

26
00:01:52,662 --> 00:01:57,160
unfrosted. The amount of cake that's frosted or unfrosted depends on the size

27
00:01:57,172 --> 00:02:01,234
and shape of the original cake. The neat thing about fractions is that 2 3rds

28
00:02:01,451 --> 00:02:05,951
could describe this part of a round cake or this part of a rectangular cake.

29
00:02:06,055 --> 00:02:08,655
Fractions describe a part of a whole object.
