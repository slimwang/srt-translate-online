Composition of functions also shows how 
different functions are related to one another.

2
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:07,930
In fact, sometimes it can be helpful to 
figure out how we might write functions

3
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:13,172
as compositions of other functions. 
For instance, let's say we have the

4
00:00:13,172 --> 00:00:18,912
function h of x equals x plus 3 squared. 
I'd like to find two functions f and g,

5
00:00:18,912 --> 00:00:23,490
such that, f of g of x is equal to h of 
x.

6
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:25,860
What do you think these two functions 
could be?

7
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:28,588
Now, I personally think this is a hard 
problem, but it's not a big deal at all

8
00:00:28,588 --> 00:00:32,502
if this takes you few tries. 
Just think about what operations are

9
00:00:32,502 --> 00:00:35,638
being performed here on x to give us h of 
x.

10
00:00:35,638 --> 00:00:39,544
And think about what order we have to do 
them in and therefore what functions

11
00:00:39,544 --> 00:00:44,636
correspond to those different operations. 
At the end, check your answer, by

12
00:00:44,636 --> 00:00:49,570
plugging in what you have for g of x. 
As the input of f, and see if you end up

13
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:50,923
with h of x.
