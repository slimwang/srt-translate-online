1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,484
So let's revisit this inclusive scan example.

2
00:00:02,484 --> 00:00:05,483
We have again a 6-element input sequence,

3
00:00:05,483 --> 00:00:09,891
and we're going to reduce it with the plus operator to generate this output sequence.

4
00:00:09,891 --> 00:00:16,059
Let's think about it this way. What is this output element as a function of all these input elements?

5
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:19,632
Well, really what it is is just a reduction of the 1st element.

6
00:00:19,632 --> 00:00:24,761
The 2nd output element is simply a reduction of the 1st 2 input elements,

7
00:00:24,761 --> 00:00:29,854
the 3rd output element is a reduction of the first 3 inputs, and so on.

8
00:00:29,854 --> 00:00:34,491
In general, the nth output element is the reduction of the 1st n input elements.

9
00:00:34,491 --> 00:00:38,988
So if we want to go ahead and compute this output as a function of the input,

10
00:00:38,988 --> 00:00:42,021
we can do that with the tools that we already have at our disposal.

11
00:00:42,021 --> 00:00:46,724
To compute all n outputs, we simply run n separate reductions,

12
00:00:46,724 --> 00:00:49,796
and then we can run all n of these reductions in parallel.

13
00:00:50,611 --> 00:00:52,376
So let's take a quiz on this.

14
00:00:52,376 --> 00:00:56,605
As a function of n, how many steps is it going to take to scan in this way,

15
00:00:56,605 --> 00:01:00,745
with n reductions, and how much work is it going to take overall?

16
00:01:00,745 --> 00:01:03,738
And our choices are constant amount of steps or work,

17
00:01:03,738 --> 00:01:09,115
amount of steps or work proportional to the logarithm of the size of the input,

18
00:01:09,115 --> 00:01:12,807
a linear relationship between the size of the input and the number of steps

19
00:01:12,807 --> 00:01:14,475
or the amount of work,

20
00:01:14,475 --> 00:01:16,716
and a quadratic relationship between the size of the input

21
00:01:16,716 --> 00:01:19,067
and the number of steps and the number of work.

22
00:01:19,067 --> 00:01:23,718
So what I'd like you to do is check the right box in the steps row and check the right box in the work row

23
00:01:23,718 --> 00:01:26,672
that corresponds to the relationship between the size of the input

24
00:01:26,672 --> 00:01:29,072
and the number of steps or the amount of work.
