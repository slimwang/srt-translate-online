00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:07,193
Recall the formula for finding the distance between two points. Substituting in

2
00:00:07,205 --> 00:00:13,905
the formula for u and c, we get. And when we simplify, we obtain the square root

3
00:00:13,917 --> 00:00:18,043
of 25 plus 9, which gives us the square root of 34.
