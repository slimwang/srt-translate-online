1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,711
Here are a few common types of
market segmentation practices.

2
00:00:03,711 --> 00:00:08,141
Behavioral, psychographic, demographic,

3
00:00:08,141 --> 00:00:14,270
geographic, occasional,
and cultural segmentation.

4
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:18,220
Let's start by talking about behavioral
and psychographic segmentation.

5
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:21,252
Behavioral segmentation
considers a few things,

6
00:00:21,252 --> 00:00:23,585
such as the knowledge of your product.

7
00:00:23,585 --> 00:00:25,709
Their attitude towards your product.

8
00:00:25,709 --> 00:00:30,250
How or how often they use your product
or how they respond to your product.

9
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:32,709
Their loyalty to your product.

10
00:00:32,709 --> 00:00:36,675
And you can also think about creating a
segment based on what your customer will

11
00:00:36,675 --> 00:00:39,100
benefit from your product.

12
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:41,810
Behavioral segmentation
is a great place to start

13
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:44,270
when you think about
segmenting your market.

14
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:46,480
Let's take an energy bar, for example.

15
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:47,543
What's important to you?

16
00:00:47,543 --> 00:00:49,500
Do you look at the price?

17
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,220
Do you look at the calories?

18
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:54,450
Do you want something that has
less calories or more calories?

19
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:56,480
Do you look at the protein?

20
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,340
Or maybe you don't care,
and you're just hungry?

21
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:01,491
Our messaging for
each of these segments, so

22
00:01:01,491 --> 00:01:04,661
the people who are just hungry,
the people who want more protein or

23
00:01:04,661 --> 00:01:07,335
less calories, or
the people who care about the price.

24
00:01:07,335 --> 00:01:08,959
The message is going to be different.

25
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:11,662
And it's going to be affected by
the different benefits that these

26
00:01:11,662 --> 00:01:13,070
customers seek.

27
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:15,600
We also need to think about the places,
online or

28
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:20,100
offline, where our customers may
find each of these segments.

29
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:21,790
So, say it's offline.

30
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:26,220
We may consider to put a poster in
a gym, marketing our energy bar.

31
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:31,660
And online, we might want to add an add
to a page that sells workout clothes.

32
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:34,590
Now let's talk about
psychographic segmentation.

33
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:39,440
This segmentation is achieved by
studying activities, interests, and

34
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,640
the opinions of your customers.

35
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,292
You're thinking about
the lifestyle of your customer.

36
00:01:44,292 --> 00:01:45,793
How do they spend their downtime?

37
00:01:45,793 --> 00:01:48,125
What are they influenced by?

38
00:01:48,125 --> 00:01:50,445
What image are they trying to project?

39
00:01:50,445 --> 00:01:54,815
What are the needs and wants of people
in this common lifestyle group?

40
00:01:54,815 --> 00:01:58,580
For example, usually people who buy
a luxury car can not only afford it,

41
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:01,390
thus defining their economic status, but

42
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:06,620
it also shows a preference to spend
money on more luxury lifestyle products.

43
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:11,055
So we can extrapolate that they may
travel to high class destinations,

44
00:02:11,055 --> 00:02:14,646
wear specific brands, or
visit certain establishments.

45
00:02:14,646 --> 00:02:18,786
So, say we're trying to sell a luxury
car, if we want to market to people who

46
00:02:18,786 --> 00:02:23,084
can afford it, we're going to consider
doing that in other high-end places.

47
00:02:23,084 --> 00:02:26,941
Such as a luxury magazine found in the
first class section of an airline, or

48
00:02:26,941 --> 00:02:30,020
sponsoring the valet outside
of an expensive restaurant.
