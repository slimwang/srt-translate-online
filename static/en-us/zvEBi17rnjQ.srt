00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:04,220
Another useful feature of an address
book, would be to delete a contact.

2
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:07,620
So let's start working on
specing out that feature.

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:11,471
Just like before, all,
to find a new spec with the it method,

4
00:00:11,471 --> 00:00:15,920
I'll accentuate my addressBook and
thisContact variables just like before

5
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:20,170
and then I'll add the contact to my
address book so that I can delete it.

6
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:23,930
Now, we haven't written
a deleteContact method yet.

7
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:25,810
So we know we're going to get a failure.

8
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:30,280
But what should our expectation or
our test for this spec be?

9
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:35,030
My test for this spec is if I get
the first contact from my address book,

10
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:38,460
I expect that object not to be defined.

11
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:41,380
If I deleted it, it shouldn't exist.

12
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:44,380
After refreshing my spec runner,
I now see an error again.

13
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:47,140
I have two specs,
with one of them failing.

14
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:49,580
One of them passed, and one's failing.

15
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:51,600
It says undefined is not a function.

16
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,690
And, it's on line 16 of AddressBookSpec.

17
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:57,480
This is in reference to
my deleteContact method.

18
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,390
So I need to go write that function.

19
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:03,510
I can use the splice method of
an array to remove an element.

20
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:07,160
I then rerun my test and see that
my implementation was successful.

21
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:10,280
My address book can add a contact,
and it can delete a contact.
