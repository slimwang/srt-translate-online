1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:04,380
When we initialized to this computer's
turn variable using the default in that

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:08,010
method we never actually set
its move property to anything.

3
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:11,250
We need to fill in our generate
move method in order to randomly

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:13,390
generate a move for the computer.

5
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:16,239
The best tool for
this job is a switch statement.

6
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:21,160
The syntax for switch statements in
Objective-C take this general form.

7
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:25,000
Switch statements in Objective-C
are quite limited compared to Swift and

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,330
that they can only condition
upon the value of an integer.

9
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:31,490
They also differ in that the flow
of control falls through.

10
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:34,850
That means you need to include a break
statement following the statement to be

11
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:36,820
executed for each case.

12
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:40,040
It's also required that you
include a default case.

13
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,920
Now let's apply this to
our generateMove method.

14
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,250
To generate a random move for

15
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:47,990
the computer, we'll first need
a random integer between zero and two.

16
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:52,310
We'll get that using this line of code,
using the familiar arc4random method.

17
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:55,220
Now on to our switch statement.

18
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:58,350
Will switch on the value of
the interger we just generated and

19
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:01,120
return a different move for each case.

20
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,770
Note the break statements
after each case.

21
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:07,370
We're going to need a default case
to catch any invalid numbers.

22
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:11,030
But right now our enum just
has three expected choices.

23
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:15,300
Let's add a case for invalid to our
enum, and then we can return that for

24
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:16,720
our default case.

25
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,870
Now we have a catch-all in the event
that we get some number that's not

26
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:21,320
between 0 and 2.

27
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:25,850
We check that we have a break statement
after the default case, and that's it.

28
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:27,780
Our generateMove method is ready to go.
