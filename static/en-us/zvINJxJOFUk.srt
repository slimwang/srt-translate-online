So far we've seen how to get
the app shell into the cache.

2
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:09,790
But how do we get it out so that on
a slow network or even no network,

3
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:14,070
we're still able to get the resources
required to run our app.

4
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:18,150
For that we'll need to intercept
all the network requests

5
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:21,250
by handling the fetch event
in the service worker.

6
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:24,520
And serving the requested
resource from the cache.

7
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:29,940
Stepping from inside out
caches.match evaluates the request

8
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:35,030
that triggered the fetch, and checks
to see if it's available in the cache.

9
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:38,950
It then either responds
with the cached version, or

10
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:41,620
uses fetch to get a copy
from the network.

11
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:48,009
The response is then passed back
to the webpage with e.respondWith
