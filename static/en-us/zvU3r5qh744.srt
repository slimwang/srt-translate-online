00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,650
Once a registration authority
has verified identity,

2
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:05,770
certificates can be issued.

3
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:08,770
That's the job of
the certificate authority.

4
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:10,860
They issue the certificates and

5
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:16,000
typically encrypt public keys
using their private keys.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,810
Can you think about what that does?

7
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:23,570
Hint, we just discussed
a similar concept under trust.

8
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:26,400
Why does the certificate
authority encrypt

9
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,670
public keys with their private keys?
