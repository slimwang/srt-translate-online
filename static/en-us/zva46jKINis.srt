1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,550
As the last thing, we'll learn a very
useful method to recycle our data

2
00:00:03,549 --> 00:00:06,279
called k-fold cross validation.

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:10,080
As we have learned, testing is done by
separating our data into a training and

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,300
a testing set.

5
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:14,679
But this is not always ideal as we seem
to be throwing away some data that

6
00:00:14,679 --> 00:00:17,259
could be useful for
training our algorithm.

7
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:20,070
Is there anything we can do
to not throw away this data?

8
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:22,089
But at the same time not cheat?

9
00:00:22,089 --> 00:00:23,289
Well here's the solution, and

10
00:00:23,289 --> 00:00:25,809
this is when K Fold Cross Validation
comes in to play.

11
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:30,850
What we do with K Fold Cross Validation
is to break our data in to K buckets.

12
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:32,859
In this case, K is four.

13
00:00:32,859 --> 00:00:35,979
Then we just train our model K times.

14
00:00:35,979 --> 00:00:39,619
Each time using a different
bucket as our testing set and

15
00:00:39,619 --> 00:00:43,030
the remaining points
as our training set.

16
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:46,520
Then we average the results
to get a final model.

17
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:49,280
The command to do this in
sklearn is very simple.

18
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,420
All we have to do is
create a KFold object

19
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:56,469
where the parameters are the size of the
data and the size of the testing set.

20
00:00:56,469 --> 00:01:00,649
It is always recommended to randomize
our data to remove any hint of a bias.

21
00:01:00,649 --> 00:01:02,850
Here we are still splitting
our data into buckets,

22
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:05,900
except these are chosen
randomly instead of in order.

23
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:08,760
Randomizing is also easily
done in sklearn by setting

24
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:12,980
the shuffle parameter to true when
we initialize our KFold object.
