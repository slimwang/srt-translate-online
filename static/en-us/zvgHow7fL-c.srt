00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,420
So in quick summary, in this lesson I covered the basic concepts of how we

2
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:08,580
can take point processes, how computations at the pixel values, and

3
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:11,320
use that to add images, subtract images.

4
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:16,526
I showed you how to use this to be able to do simple processes on images.

5
00:00:16,526 --> 00:00:19,560
Showed an example that by just doing this we actually can

6
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,620
learn more about transparency the alpha blending,

7
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:25,830
which is used commonly in image processing types of techniques.

8
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:30,130
Alpha blending is also widely used to be able to represent the transparency

9
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:33,110
layer which is actually another processing thing that can be used for

10
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:33,959
masking images.

11
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:39,150
And again, I showed an example of how we would use an image histogram and

12
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:41,280
all of the statistics that come with it to help but

13
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,860
look at images a little bit more carefully.

14
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:49,030
In next class, what we will do is now we will look at not just pixels.

15
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:53,670
So, you know, we were so far concentrating on images where each index is known.

16
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:54,629
We had an image.

17
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:57,700
And I looked at a pixel.

18
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:01,690
Of course, so far in this case we took another image that had a pixel.

19
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:04,840
But now we want to also start looking at is what happens in

20
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,700
the neighborhood around the pixels.

21
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:11,410
And that will let us introduce us to the concept of convolution and correlation.

22
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:12,030
Look forward to it.
