1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,150
For this exercise let's launch
the memory churn activity.

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:05,860
Oh hello there pirate.

3
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:09,040
Now press the button,
do interesting things with arrays.

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,672
I'm sure you noticed that the dancing
pirate hangs or pauses, but

5
00:00:11,672 --> 00:00:13,400
then eventually resume dancing.

6
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:16,670
As you know, this is Jank and
it's bad for many reasons.

7
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:18,160
So let's go ahead and fix it.

8
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,440
Now this should sound familiar, so

9
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:22,520
go ahead and profile this activity
using trace view and when you're done,

10
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:25,150
you should see a tool
output similar to this one.

11
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:28,640
Notice the frequent GC events that are
happening within a short period of time.

12
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,100
Now given what you know
about garbage collection,

13
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:33,420
what do you see in this timeline view
that might be hurting app performance?

14
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:34,980
Write your observations in this box.
