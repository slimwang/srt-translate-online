00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,942
You now have knowledge of all the basic elements for creating a scene, objects,

2
00:00:02,942 --> 00:00:06,557
lights, and cameras. You have a considerably easier time of it than these

3
00:00:06,557 --> 00:00:09,906
people, as far as rendering the scene goes. The computer does all that for you,

00:00:09,906 --> 00:00:13,816
letting you focus on how to craft the objects themselves. In the next unit,

5
00:00:13,816 --> 00:00:16,720
we'll show how to significantly increase the visual richness of models in your

6
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,810
virtual world, through the use of texture mapping.
