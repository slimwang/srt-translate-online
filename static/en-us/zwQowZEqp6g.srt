1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,390
Now let's code two more
functions in our library.

2
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:05,950
A function to compute
a vector's magnitude and

3
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:08,790
a function to compute its normalization.

4
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:12,575
As before, use your program to compute
the answers to the following questions.

5
00:00:12,575 --> 00:00:17,133
For the first question,
please find the magnitude of

6
00:00:17,133 --> 00:00:21,295
the vector negative 0.221, 7.437.

7
00:00:21,295 --> 00:00:27,269
For the second question,
please find the magnitude of 8.813,

8
00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:31,390
negative 1.331, negative 6.247.

9
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:39,911
For the third question, please find the
normalization of 5.581, negative 2.136.

10
00:00:39,911 --> 00:00:45,193
And for the last question,
please find the normalization

11
00:00:45,193 --> 00:00:51,137
of the vector 1.996,
3.108, negative 4.554.

12
00:00:51,137 --> 00:00:56,340
Please enter your solutions within an
accuracy of at least 3 decimal places.
