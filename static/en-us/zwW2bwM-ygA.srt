00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:05,410
What is design? Design is deliberative, purposive planning.

2
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:10,250
As far as software is concerned, this translates into solving some problem.

3
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:14,290
Given in a, as a set of requirements. What is engineering?

4
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:18,120
Engineering adds in the element of science and mathematics. And

5
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:22,440
we're going to see the role of formal methods play in software design.

6
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:26,850
What is craft? Craft is some sort of skilled occupation.

7
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:31,350
Those skills come from long experience, and we'll see that with software design,

8
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:35,180
the more experience you have on a particular kind of problem the better.

9
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:39,750
And what is art? Art is the conscious use of skills. Taste and

10
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:43,230
creative imagination in the production of aesthetic objects. And

11
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:47,620
later in this lesson, we'll see that, certain design principles and

12
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:50,480
aesthetic principles can play a role in software design.
