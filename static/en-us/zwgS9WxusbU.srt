1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,620
As part of this class,

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:05,260
I want you to start to get a glimpse
of the whole world of Android.

3
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:09,320
There's so much more that lies beyond
this course, beyond Android Studio,

4
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:12,400
beyond the documentation
pages that we've read.

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,996
One of the reasons that I love being a
part of the Android developer community,

6
00:00:15,996 --> 00:00:17,032
is because there's so

7
00:00:17,032 --> 00:00:19,661
many cool open-source apps
out there that I can browse.

8
00:00:19,661 --> 00:00:23,982
An open-source app means that the source
code that was used to create that app is

9
00:00:23,982 --> 00:00:26,191
made available for other people to see.

10
00:00:26,191 --> 00:00:29,727
There are certain restrictions
on how you can actually use it,

11
00:00:29,727 --> 00:00:31,660
if you can adapt it or modify it, so

12
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:36,280
you have to check the license of
the individual app for more details.

13
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:39,980
If you see a really cool feature in an
app, you can Google Search for it, and

14
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:41,840
try to find code for that.

15
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,320
If it's an open-source app, you might
be able to find the exact code, or

16
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:47,960
you might be able to find a library

17
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:52,100
that has that specific
functionality that you can look at.

18
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:55,610
Let's try to Google Search for
some open-source Android apps.

19
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:59,150
Then we can see how something like
Android resources are used in action.

20
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:03,930
I'm going to Google Search for
open-source Android apps.

21
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:05,611
This Wikipedia link looks good.

22
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:09,456
And there's a whole list of apps here.

23
00:01:11,559 --> 00:01:17,390
So I want to bring your attention to one
app in particular, the Google IO app.

24
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:23,110
Google IO is an annual conference
organized by guess who, and

25
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:26,860
it's for all the developers
who use Google technologies.

26
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:30,462
So Android developers for example,
will attend this conference, and

27
00:01:30,462 --> 00:01:34,182
learn about the latest changes in
Android, how to make their app better,

28
00:01:34,182 --> 00:01:35,640
and meet other developers.

29
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,809
For the conference,
Google creates an Android app.

30
00:01:38,809 --> 00:01:41,090
Let's click on the link to open it.

31
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:45,244
So for this conference, Google creates
an Android app, and then the Android app

32
00:01:45,244 --> 00:01:48,500
is made open-source so
other developers can look at the code.

33
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,534
This is what the app looks like.

34
00:01:49,534 --> 00:01:52,297
It listed all the events for
the conference.

35
00:01:52,297 --> 00:01:55,701
If you have your own conference coming
up, and you want to build an app for

36
00:01:55,701 --> 00:01:57,822
it, this would be a good
example to look at.

37
00:01:57,822 --> 00:01:59,540
So anyways,
lets go back to the GitHub code.

38
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:03,974
This is where all the code for
the Google IO app is.

39
00:02:03,974 --> 00:02:07,853
I'm going to look for how they use
Resources, within a certain activity.

40
00:02:07,853 --> 00:02:10,520
I'm going to hit
the keyboard shortcut T, and

41
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:14,427
that will immediately begin
a search across all of their files.

42
00:02:14,427 --> 00:02:16,270
It's a pretty nifty shortcut.

43
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:18,467
So I'm going to type Activity, and

44
00:02:18,467 --> 00:02:22,319
this will show me all files
that have Activity in the name.

45
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:24,265
Let's look at the WelcomeActivity.

46
00:02:24,265 --> 00:02:26,482
And this is the code for
the WelcomeActivity.

47
00:02:26,482 --> 00:02:28,722
It's a pretty short Java file.

48
00:02:28,722 --> 00:02:32,774
To find how they use resources,
I'm going to hit Cmd+F, or

49
00:02:32,774 --> 00:02:35,926
you can use Ctrl+F,
if you're on Windows.

50
00:02:35,926 --> 00:02:38,561
I'm going to search for R dot.

51
00:02:38,561 --> 00:02:41,624
I believe that Chrome doesn't
have case sensitive search, so

52
00:02:41,624 --> 00:02:44,929
I'll just have to search for
incidences of the capital R, myself.

53
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:51,070
So in this first case,
we have R.layout.activity_welcome.

54
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:52,502
It looks like the layout for

55
00:02:52,502 --> 00:02:56,910
the WelcomeActivity is stored in
the activity_welcome XML file.

56
00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:00,380
That's pretty cool that we can tell
all of that, just from this one line.

57
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:01,586
The next resource is here.

58
00:03:01,586 --> 00:03:04,572
It says R.id.button_accept.

59
00:03:04,572 --> 00:03:08,350
Since the resource type is id, and
we're talking about a button here,

60
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:12,910
it looks like this is the view ID for
the Accept button in the app.

61
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:17,030
And the Accept button should
be in this XML layout.

62
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:20,092
And look,
there's something similar down here.

63
00:03:20,092 --> 00:03:21,712
It says, R.id.button_decline.

64
00:03:21,712 --> 00:03:25,134
This looks like the view ID for
the Decline button,

65
00:03:25,134 --> 00:03:27,926
that's also defined in this XML layout.

66
00:03:27,926 --> 00:03:31,675
So stepping back a bit,
it looks like this welcome screen has

67
00:03:31,675 --> 00:03:34,996
an Accept button, and
a Decline button of some sort.

68
00:03:34,996 --> 00:03:38,499
But you're not exactly sure,
what you're accepting or declining.

69
00:03:38,499 --> 00:03:40,970
Let's scroll down some more.

70
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:45,183
The last resource ID is
android.R.string.ok.

71
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:50,716
This part looks familiar, R.string.ok,
this looks like a string resource.

72
00:03:50,716 --> 00:03:55,560
It probably contains the word ok,
that's just a wild guess.

73
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,560
This is new though,
it starts with android dot.

74
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,846
This means that this string resource
is provided by the Android system.

75
00:04:02,846 --> 00:04:04,788
It's built-in to Android.

76
00:04:04,788 --> 00:04:08,542
It makes sense though because it's
a pretty generic string, so instead of

77
00:04:08,542 --> 00:04:12,430
creating our own string that says, ok,
we can just use the one in the system.

78
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:16,666
So those were some interesting
use cases of resources,

79
00:04:16,666 --> 00:04:19,420
within the WelcomeActivity
of the Google IO app.

80
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:23,116
Let's navigate back to the root
folder of the app to look more

81
00:04:23,116 --> 00:04:24,930
at their Android resources.

82
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:27,213
I'm going to click on
the android folder,

83
00:04:27,213 --> 00:04:29,976
because I think this is where
the Android app code is.

84
00:04:29,976 --> 00:04:34,830
And then click on source, main, and
then here is the res directory for

85
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:36,568
all of their resources.

86
00:04:36,568 --> 00:04:37,988
Inside the Res directory,

87
00:04:37,988 --> 00:04:41,082
we can see a lot of the folders
that we talked about earlier.

88
00:04:41,082 --> 00:04:46,642
There is a folder for
animation files, colors, graphics.

89
00:04:46,642 --> 00:04:50,426
This is the default folder for graphics,
and it's called the drawable folder.

90
00:04:50,426 --> 00:04:54,784
You can also provide alternative
graphics in these other drawable

91
00:04:54,784 --> 00:04:55,492
folders.

92
00:04:55,492 --> 00:04:58,210
These are for
different screen resolutions.

93
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:04,380
We also have layout folders,
menu folders, mipmap folders for

94
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:10,520
the launcher icons or the app icons,
and we also have values folders.

95
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:14,550
This is the default folder for values,
and then you can see all these

96
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:19,040
other folders that start with values,
but they have a different ending.

97
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,600
This is where you can provide
alternative resources,

98
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:26,140
like text strings in German, or
Spanish, or French, and so on.

99
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:29,814
Or you can provide specific resources
for different versions of Android.

100
00:05:29,814 --> 00:05:32,174
In the values-v21 folder,

101
00:05:32,174 --> 00:05:37,993
you would put in resources that are
specific to Lollipop devices and above.

102
00:05:37,993 --> 00:05:41,068
That's because Lollipop is version 21.

103
00:05:41,068 --> 00:05:43,598
Let's look inside the values folder,
to see what they have.

104
00:05:43,598 --> 00:05:48,583
In the colors.xml file, we see a bunch
of colors are being defined here.

105
00:05:48,583 --> 00:05:54,726
In the dimens file, we see a bunch of
dimensions, and a bunch of dp values.

106
00:05:54,726 --> 00:05:56,007
And in the strings file,

107
00:05:56,007 --> 00:05:58,940
we see a bunch of text strings
here that appear in the app.

108
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,860
Now, it's your turn.

109
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:05,580
Go ahead, and skim through the articles
that we talked about earlier.

110
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:08,000
These are all linked in
instructor notes below.

111
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,710
Then try to search for an open source
app, that you find interesting.

112
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:13,790
Look through one of their
Activity files, and

113
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:16,780
try to identify some uses of resources.

114
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:19,480
Then post about it in
the discussion forum.

115
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,432
This is a pretty open ended exercise,

116
00:06:21,432 --> 00:06:24,740
to help you explore the open
source that are out there.

117
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:28,008
And we want you to try to identify the
things that you've learned in this class

118
00:06:28,008 --> 00:06:29,900
within those apps.

119
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:32,190
We look forward to hearing,
what you find out.

120
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:35,110
And feel free to give other students
feedback on the forum as well,

121
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:36,860
to help guide them in their learning.

122
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:40,330
When you're done, tell us which
app you chose by writing it here.

123
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:42,170
Have fun.
