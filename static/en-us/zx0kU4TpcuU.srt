00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:04,950
Here we would say that there are two levels of the IV, or independent variable.

2
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:09,230
Giving high fives and no high fives. It's important to remember that I'm

3
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:14,040
treating the two groups exactly the same way. The only difference is one is

4
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:18,650
getting high fives. And the other is not, so I'm only manipulating the

5
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:22,420
independent variable. So, now that we know what the independent variable is,

6
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:29,290
what is the dependent variable? My coworkers, happiness, or high fives? Select

7
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:30,930
the one you think is a dependent variable.
