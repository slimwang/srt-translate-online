00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,020
One of the criticisms that some people
have of online education is they

2
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:05,740
suggest that the kind of collaboration
we can have in person is

3
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:07,240
difficult to do online.

4
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:10,280
If you're taking an online class, the
teacher can say, hey, get into groups

5
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:13,910
and discuss this topic or complete this
activity, and you move your desks around

6
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:16,780
and you move around in a lecture hall,
you sit face-to-face with one another,

7
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:20,040
you do something, and then you break and
go back to the regular class.

8
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:23,030
And some people point out that
it's difficult to do that online.

9
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:23,710
And even more so,

10
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:26,950
things like group projects that are very
valuable in traditional education

11
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:29,330
can also be difficult to do
when you can't meet in person.

12
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:33,230
You can't gather around a table and chat
about ideas or scribble on paper and

13
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:34,680
share it with one another.

14
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:38,170
So how can we develop technology that
lets people actually collaborate on

15
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:40,120
projects or learning at a distance?

16
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:43,487
There's a field that tries to address
this called computer-supported

17
00:00:43,487 --> 00:00:44,910
collaborative work.

18
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:47,550
It tries to develop tools that
allow people to collaborate,

19
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:49,970
even when they're not
colocated in the same room.

20
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:52,020
But it's actually not just
about online learning either.

21
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:55,240
It's not just focused on developing
tools that allow people to collaborate

22
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,309
when they're not colocated.

23
00:00:56,309 --> 00:01:00,380
It also tries to develop tools that
make collaboration easier in general.

24
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:03,360
A very simple example that can
be considered something of

25
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:07,050
an instance of computer-supported
collaborative work is Google Docs.

26
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:10,800
That's a document interface that lets
multiple people edit the same document

27
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,150
at the same time.

28
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:14,740
If you've done anything before
Google Docs came along,

29
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:17,960
you probably remember the days when you
had to pass the document around amongst

30
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:21,700
people and tell who was doing the edits
at a given time and control for

31
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:23,710
versions and
do a lot of headachy things like that.

32
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:27,230
But with Google Docs, we can all log in
to the same document at the same time,

33
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:28,992
collaborate on it, and move on.

34
00:01:28,992 --> 00:01:33,430
So computer-supported collaborative work
is not just about learning together,

35
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:35,940
not just about collaborating
on learning activities.

36
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:39,630
It's also about collaborating
via computers in general.

37
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:42,320
But in this class, we're going to really
talk about how we can use technology to

38
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,890
enable collaboration in
the context of education.
