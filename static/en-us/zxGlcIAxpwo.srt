1
00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:04,250
Let's do the first one,
it says TextView = new TextView, and

2
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:07,861
then we pass context in as an input
parameter to the constructor.

3
00:00:07,861 --> 00:00:11,929
The problem with this line of code is
that we're creating a new object but

4
00:00:11,929 --> 00:00:14,540
we're not storing it
properly in a variable.

5
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:18,560
We're saying that the variable
should have data type TextView but

6
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,570
we forget to give it a variable name.

7
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:23,910
So the correct code would
look something like this.

8
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:28,120
TextView followed by a variable name and
then equals new TextView.

9
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:31,160
You can call the variable
name something else but

10
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:34,150
we just chose to use textView
with a lower case t.

11
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:38,440
So in this case,
the error was missing variable name.

12
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:39,250
Let's do the next one.

13
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:43,350
It says, image view img = new ImageView.

14
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:47,865
The problem here is that this
is not a valid object data type.

15
00:00:47,865 --> 00:00:52,320
Android defines a class called ImageView
with a capital I and a capital V and

16
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,600
it's squished together into one word.

17
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,780
A valid class name can't
have any spaces in it.

18
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:59,050
The variable name looks okay, and

19
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:01,740
then creating the new image
view looks okay as well.

20
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:04,989
So the only error was that it
had an incorrect class name.

21
00:01:04,989 --> 00:01:07,790
In the third statement, we're trying
to create a new toggle button.

22
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:11,640
It says ToggleButton button
= create ToggleButton.

23
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,890
We're calling the ToggleButton
class here, so

24
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:18,040
we need to use the Java keyword new,
not create.

25
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,020
And this is the correct code.

26
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:22,145
It says ToggleButton
button = new ToggleButton.

27
00:01:22,145 --> 00:01:25,910
The problem here was not
using the Java keyword new.

28
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:30,450
New is the keyword that indicates that
we're trying to create a new object.

29
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:32,892
In the fourth statement,
we're trying to create a new toast.

30
00:01:32,892 --> 00:01:35,620
You could've Google searched for
how to create a new toast and

31
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:37,450
then compared it with this code here.

32
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:40,700
The problem here is that toast needs
to be spelled with a capital T,

33
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:43,320
because this is a class name for Toast.

34
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:46,670
This is using a factory method
like we talked about earlier.

35
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:50,400
This creates a new toast object and
then it gets stored in this variable.

36
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:53,360
So the error here was just
an incorrect class name.

37
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,410
So now that we know how to create
objects, how do we use these objects?
