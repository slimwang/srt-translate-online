1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The answer is, given the assumptions here, P must not be prime.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
And the reason for that is P is greater than Pn.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
And we said this set includes all prime numbers--

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
that's the assumption we started with for this proof,

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
and this number's the product of many numbers--

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
all of these are positive, adding 1 to it.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
So the value of P must be greater that P sub N

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
and that means, according to our assumption about the limited set of all primes,

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
P must not be prime.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
So since P is not a prime, that means it must be a composite--

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
which means it must be the product of some prime number and some other integer.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
So that means we can write P as some prime,

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
and we've said all the primes are in this set,

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
so it's something selected from that set,

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
multiplied by some other number--we don't know what Q is

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
other than it must be an integer.

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
So now we have P, which we computed as the product of all these primes plus 1

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
which is equal to some prime from that set times Q.
