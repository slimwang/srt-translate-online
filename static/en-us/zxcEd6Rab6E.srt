00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:03,238
Like all of our other equations, we can check to make sure that this solution

2
00:00:03,238 --> 00:00:07,980
is correct. If we substitute in positive root 6 into our equation, we'll notice

3
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:14,230
that it checks. The square root of 6 squared equals 6, and 5 times 6 equals 30.

4
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:19,201
But remember, we can have the positive answer or the negative answer. So let's

5
00:00:19,201 --> 00:00:23,712
check x equal to negative root 6. We plug in negative root 6 in for x, and

6
00:00:23,712 --> 00:00:29,094
square it. Squaring a negative number always results in a positive. So we know

7
00:00:29,094 --> 00:00:35,288
negative root 6 squared equals positive 6. Then we have 5 times 6, which is 30,

8
00:00:35,288 --> 00:00:40,256
so our answer checks. This is always a great way to check your answers. ANd

9
00:00:40,256 --> 00:00:44,890
this reinforces why we have the plus or minus symbol. It's because we have two

10
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:46,079
answers.
