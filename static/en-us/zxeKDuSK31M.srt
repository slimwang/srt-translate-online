1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,723
We could really group this data any way we want. In fact, we could only have two

2
00:00:05,735 --> 00:00:11,421
rows, one for the number of students younger than 50 years old, and one for the

3
00:00:11,433 --> 00:00:16,955
number greater, but we don't have to. We could even have one row for each age.

4
00:00:17,074 --> 00:00:22,236
So here, we could have 10, 11, 12, and then we would count to see how many

5
00:00:22,248 --> 00:00:28,013
students are aged 10, how many students are aged 11. But this is not the most

6
00:00:28,025 --> 00:00:34,155
convenient way. That's because, the frequency would most likely be 1 for all of

7
00:00:34,167 --> 00:00:39,676
them, maybe 2 for a few. So, instead of doing that, how about we choose an

8
00:00:39,688 --> 00:00:46,235
interval for each row? For example, 0 to 19 and then 20 to 39, then we can count

9
00:00:46,247 --> 00:00:52,625
how many students are between ages 0 and 19, between 20 and 39, etc. This is

10
00:00:52,637 --> 00:00:59,386
called the interval or bin or bucket. For the most part, we'll either call it an

11
00:00:59,398 --> 00:01:05,652
interval or the bin and in this case the bin size is 20. That's because it

12
00:01:05,664 --> 00:01:06,593
includes 0.
