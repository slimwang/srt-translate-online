>> What's a way to put the standard deviation in words? Just to warn you, this

2
00:00:04,622 --> 00:00:09,191
is going to be a really tricky quiz. Maybe read them out loud slowly. You'll

3
00:00:09,191 --> 00:00:14,001
have to think about each one, but this will really help you understand what the

4
00:00:14,001 --> 00:00:18,988
standard deviation is. Are you ready? Here are your options. More than one of

5
00:00:18,988 --> 00:00:24,159
these could be correct. I put parentheses to specify the procedure. So, for

6
00:00:24,159 --> 00:00:29,407
example, with this one here, I could have put parentheses around just sum of

7
00:00:29,407 --> 00:00:34,983
absolute deviations, which would mean you find each absolute deviation, you sum

8
00:00:34,983 --> 00:00:40,297
them up, and then you square it. But instead I put the parentheses here, which

9
00:00:40,297 --> 00:00:45,545
means you take the absolute deviation, you square each one, and then you take

10
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:50,995
the sum. This one's a little more complicated. This basically means that you sum

11
00:00:50,995 --> 00:00:56,017
each square deviation, then you divide it by n, and then you take the square

12
00:00:56,017 --> 00:01:00,961
root. So this will be very tricky. Go through each one of them and try and see

13
00:01:00,961 --> 00:01:05,830
if it'll give you the same thing as the standard deviation formula here. Good

14
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:06,190
luck.
