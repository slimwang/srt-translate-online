1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:03,480
Welcome to your first coding
exercise in the course.

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:07,700
We've put together a bunch of demo code
and exercises to accompany this course.

3
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:10,736
The absolute easiest way to get the code
is to download it from the downloadable

4
00:00:10,736 --> 00:00:12,330
section of the classroom.

5
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:14,080
However, if you're familiar with GitHub,

6
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:19,830
you can also find the code here
at github.com/udacity/ud867.

7
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:22,750
Once you've downloaded the code it
should look something like this.

8
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:27,180
Inside the Run Your First Task
directory, you'll find a bunch of files.

9
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:30,220
These three, the Gradle folder and
the two Gradle-W files are part of

10
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:32,320
the Gradle wrapper that
we already talked about.

11
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,022
The files you want to concern
yourself with are build.gradle and

12
00:00:35,022 --> 00:00:36,080
solution.gradle.

13
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:39,422
Every single one of these exercises
will have that pair of files.

14
00:00:39,422 --> 00:00:43,550
The build.Gradle file contains all of
the instructions for the exercise.

15
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:46,840
And the solution.radle file
contains all the solutions.

16
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:49,560
Let's open up the build.Gradle file and
your favorite text editor.

17
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:51,140
I'm going to use Sublime.

18
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:54,930
All right, so here's the instructions
for your very first exercise.

19
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:55,820
I'll let you read them on your own.

20
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:59,900
Your challenges are going to be using
the Gradle wrapper to execute a task and

21
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:01,650
then modifying that
task in a simple way.

22
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:05,700
Remember if you get stuck,
check out the solution.gradle file and

23
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,100
it'll help you out.

24
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:08,070
All right, give it a try and

25
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:10,009
then see if you can answer
the question on the next slide.

26
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:12,670
Once you're done running
your first task,

27
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:14,760
you should be able to
answer this question.

28
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,360
What is my favorite kind of candy?

29
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:20,160
Is it chocolate, taffy,
jelly beans, or bacon?

30
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:23,190
And while you're at it, did you
go ahead and run your first task?

31
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:24,290
If so, was it awesome?
