1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,526
So letâ€™s look at these distributions over here.

2
00:00:02,526 --> 00:00:05,370
They are really interesting. In the first case,

3
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:08,041
you get something like this: just the counts . In the

4
00:00:08,041 --> 00:00:11,762
second case, it looks more like this. In the

5
00:00:11,762 --> 00:00:14,373
third case and in the fourth case, we get

6
00:00:14,373 --> 00:00:16,794
something that looks really interesting, like

7
00:00:16,794 --> 00:00:18,471
this form over here. So here is a question

8
00:00:18,471 --> 00:00:20,314
for you. What happens when N equals

9
00:00:20,314 --> 00:00:22,676
10,000? When I draw it like a diagram like

10
00:00:22,676 --> 00:00:27,627
this, will it look like that, like that, like that?

11
00:00:27,627 --> 00:00:31,000
Check the one that looks most plausible.
