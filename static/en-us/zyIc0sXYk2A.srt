00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:02,910
Let's buildup our linear model for price. I'm

2
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:05,210
going to store the first model in a variable called

3
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:08,600
m1. You probably also noticed how I used the

4
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:12,810
I wrapper around each of the variables. The I

5
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:15,360
stands for as is. In this case, it tells

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,650
R to use the expression inside the I function

7
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:22,090
to transform a variable before using it in the

8
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:25,410
regression. This is instead of instructing R to interpret

9
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:29,110
these symbols as part of the formula to construct

10
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:31,300
the design matrix for the regression. You can read more

11
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:33,810
about the syntax for linear models in the instructor

12
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:37,350
notes. I can also update the previous model to add

13
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:41,590
the caret variable in the regression, using the syntax.

14
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:44,870
The real functional relationship is surely not as simple as

15
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:47,880
the cubed root of caret, so we add a

16
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:51,590
simple linear function of caret in our model predicting price.

17
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:54,570
And we can continue to make more complex models by

18
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:57,940
adding more variables. We add cut even though we don't

19
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:01,520
expect it to have much influence on price. Next, we

20
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,880
add color to a fourth model and clarity to a

21
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:07,710
fifth. When we run the code, we can see that

22
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:10,890
we're getting some very nice R square values. We're accounting

23
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:13,330
for almost all of the variance in price using the

24
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:16,706
four Cs. If we want to know whether the price for,

25
00:01:16,706 --> 00:01:19,590
a diamond is reasonable, we might now use this model.
