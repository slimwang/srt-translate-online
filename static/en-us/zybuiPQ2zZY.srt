1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Now let's recap RSA and see how things fit together.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
We have our modulus n, which is the product of 2 primes.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
We have our encryption function, which raises m to the e power,

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
and we have our decryption function, which raise the ciphertext to the d power.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:26,000
For the invertibility property, we need to know that m^(ed - 1) = 1 mod n.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
What we know from Euler is that that's true for a and n relatively prime.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:39,000
That means if we can pick e and d such that ed - 1 is equal to Ï†(n),

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
then we're real close to having the correctness property we need.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
To see how close we are, let's ask a quiz

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
whether we can determine if m and n are relatively prime.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 99:59:59,999
That's the property we need to be able to use Euler's theorem.
