1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,469
We're going to radically
rethink the design of sunshine.

2
00:00:03,469 --> 00:00:06,340
Before we dive into this further,
let me make it clear that

3
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:09,130
there are many positive things
about the sunshine design.

4
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:10,820
Particularly the portrait phone model.

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:13,790
The landscape version, however,

6
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:17,130
is very clearly a stretched
version of the portrait design.

7
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:21,040
The giant blue splash for the today view
is a nice idea, but it's a bit too much,

8
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:23,020
especially in landscape.

9
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:27,260
The use of roboto condensed, detracts
from the appeal of these reviews.

10
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:30,740
The detail views even on
a phone start to fall down.

11
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:34,620
It's a pretty simplistic presentation
with uneven use of white space.

12
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:37,580
The landscape version even,
needs to scroll to show all content.

13
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,220
For the portrait forecast view,

14
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:43,048
we're going to moving toward better
use of color and white space.

15
00:00:43,048 --> 00:00:46,405
Even though we're initially using
up more space with the app bar.

16
00:00:46,405 --> 00:00:49,260
We're going to add some code to
allow us to scroll it along with

17
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:50,540
the forecast list.

18
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:51,585
For the landscape view,

19
00:00:51,585 --> 00:00:55,400
we're doing something pretty radical in
order to improve the use of white space.

20
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:58,210
Namely we've eliminated
most of the app bar.

21
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:00,090
By taking the sides of the list in.

22
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:02,390
We provide more balance to this layout.

23
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:05,370
It's not ideal but
it's more aesthetically pleasing.

24
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:08,250
We'll also demonstrate some
parallax scrolling here.

25
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:11,810
For the detail view we're
doing a more serious overhaul.

26
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:15,010
We're using a toolbar that matches
the coloring of the detail view.

27
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:17,570
And only contains share functionality.

28
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:21,310
The bottom includes a nice accent shade
with a separate section of the app per

29
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:23,550
data unique to the detail view.

30
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:25,840
Overall, it's a far
better use of whitespace.

31
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,530
And a good teaching ground for
some more advanced layout techniques.

32
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:33,240
The landscape detail view is even more
striking in comparison to the original

33
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,460
application.

34
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:35,720
It not only has a nice look.

35
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,750
It actually fits more
information on the screen.

36
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:41,760
The landscape tablet version
wouldn't make it on google

37
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:46,000
play as a tablet optimized application
with all that unused space.

38
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,350
We'll give it a fresh
look with the update.

39
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:51,480
Our portrait tablet is even more
striking in its comparative use of

40
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,060
white space.

41
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:56,740
If the challenge to display an app
which has list like this and tablets.

42
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:59,380
Without falling into confusing
user scenarios such as

43
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:03,000
changing the number of fragments on
screen between portrait and landscape.

44
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,600
We'll dive deeper into implementing
this design throughout the lesson.
