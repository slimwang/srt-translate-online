00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:04,830
In the last lesson, we saw how we can leverage visual encodings to

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:07,710
effectively represent and present data.

3
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:12,350
Think of visual encodings as building blocks of graphics.

4
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:15,950
These are components that we can combine in creative ways to

5
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:17,270
construct a visualization.

6
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:23,580
An analogy can be drawn to how we communicate information through text.

7
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:28,180
When writing prose or an article, you construct sentences and

8
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:32,159
a narrative through using different parts of speech.

9
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:35,740
So try to think of the different visual encodings we've covered.

00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:40,700
As the nouns, verbs and adjectives of graphics
