1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,880
Say we have a decision problem, and let's call it Problem-X.

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:05,640
Now since it's a decision problem,

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:09,790
the solution to this problem is just either a yes or no answer.

4
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:12,540
Now let's also say that we have figured out

5
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:15,660
a randomized algorithm for this problem,

6
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:17,450
and we know that the randomized algorithm

7
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:23,040
returns the correct decision, yes or no, with a probability of 75 percent.

8
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:27,610
Now let's say that the randomized algorithm runs in polynomial time

9
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:32,299
and that the type of randomization it uses is basically just a coin flip.

10
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:35,920
So at certain points in the code it just flips a coin,

11
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,340
and decides to continue execution at one of two places at random.

12
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:43,820
I'd like to know which of the following statements are true.

13
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:46,520
That the algorithm can be used to produce a correct answer

14
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:50,040
with 99 percent probability in polynomial time.

15
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:54,080
That the algorithm can be modified to always produce a correct solution

16
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:57,600
on a nondeterministic RAM in polynomial time.

17
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,200
Rather that it can be modified in the same way

18
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:04,810
to produce a correct solution on a deterministic RAM in exponential time.

19
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:08,160
And finally I'd like to know if Problem-X is in NP

20
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:10,940
and also if it's NP-complete.

21
00:01:10,940 --> 99:59:59,999
So check all that are true statements.
