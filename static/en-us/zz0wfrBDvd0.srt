00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:04,570
But this inequality is intimiatly related to a rational function. Logically,

2
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:08,890
that rational function, is just 2 x minus 3, over x minus 5, equals f of x of

3
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:13,117
course. Let's just take a second to look at this rational function on it's own

4
00:00:13,117 --> 00:00:17,411
then. See if there are any vertical, horizontal, or slant asimtotes for this

5
00:00:17,411 --> 00:00:22,409
function. If there are no asymptotes of one of these types, simply type the

6
00:00:22,409 --> 00:00:27,319
word none in its box. Otherwise we're going to need equations of lines here.
