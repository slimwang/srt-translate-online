00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:03,090
Congratulations, you
completed your first lesson.

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:04,820
Now we've covered a lot
of information here.

3
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:08,080
So let's just take a moment to
reflect on some of the main takeaways.

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,380
>> First,
connect your offer to the world.

5
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:12,360
To do this,
you need to understand your market.

6
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:15,520
So you can make sure you solve the right
problem to the right audience.

7
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:19,240
>> And second, I want you to focus on
the most qualitative segment first.

8
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:23,660
That way you can really show how to
light the fire and make impact quickly.

9
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:25,760
>> Third, it's good to have competitors.

10
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,790
It shows that someone else agrees
that there is a real need and

11
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:30,210
real market for your problem.

12
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:32,090
Just make sure you find
your unique value or

13
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:35,280
main competitive advantage you can
differentiate your product with.

14
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,000
>> And finally your value proposition
isn't just a useless exercise.

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,380
I can really help you connect
deeply with your product, and

16
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:44,890
know what's important when you're
pitching it to other people like

17
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:46,490
customers and investors.

18
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:48,080
So we'll see you next
time in lesson two,

19
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:50,090
when we talk about what to
do when you launch your app.
