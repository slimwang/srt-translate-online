00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:04,058
Let me show you what I did. I removed this line. I added a parameter, then I

2
00:00:04,058 --> 00:00:10,872
used the parameter here. And am I done here? not quite. I still have to

3
00:00:10,872 --> 00:00:16,426
document the parameter. Pat yourself on the back if you did that. Now, onto the

4
00:00:16,426 --> 00:00:21,658
main method. Here, I want to read the input. So, I declare a scanner and I use

5
00:00:21,658 --> 00:00:25,370
it to read the added redness over here, I'd pass that value through the redden

6
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:31,643
method. Now, there's a couple of things that I soon need to do. First off, the

7
00:00:31,643 --> 00:00:39,631
prompt, here it is, notice print not print on and the extra space. And finally,

8
00:00:39,631 --> 00:00:44,630
up here. I need the import statement. Now, we're ready to go. When running the

9
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:49,410
program, I'm prompted for the added redness. I'm going to go and crank it way

10
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:56,670
up here. And, woah, that's pretty red. Now, the benefit of having the input

11
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:00,576
provided by the user, is I can now experiment with other values, I simply run

12
00:01:00,576 --> 00:01:07,650
the program again. And just to see if it works, I'll supply a negative number.

13
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:13,131
And as you can see, now the image got a little bluer, greener, whatever, less

14
00:01:13,131 --> 00:01:16,670
red. Now, you know how to read user input in Java.
